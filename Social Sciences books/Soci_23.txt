Chapter 1: Introduction to Lifespan Development
Developmental Psychology, also known as Human Development or Lifespan Development, is
the scientific study of ways in which people change, as well as stay the same, from conception to
death. You will no doubt discover in the course of studying that the field examines change across
a broad range of topics. These include physical and other psychophysiological processes,
cognition, language, and psychosocial development, including the impact of family and peers.
Originally concerned with infants and
Figure 1.1
children, the field has expanded to include
adolescence and more recently, aging and the
entire life span. Previously, the message was
once you are 25, your development is
essentially completed. Our academic
knowledge of the lifespan has changed, and
although there is still less research on
adulthood than on childhood, adulthood is
gaining increasing attention. This is
particularly true now that the large cohort
known as the “baby boomers” are beginning
to enter late adulthood. The assumption that
early childhood experiences dictate our future
is also being called into question. Rather, we
Source
have come to appreciate that growth and
change continues throughout life and experience continues to have an impact on who we are and
how we relate to others. We now recognize that adulthood is a dynamic period of life marked by
continued cognitive, social, and psychological development.
You will also discover that developmental psychologists investigate key questions, such as
whether children are qualitatively different from adults or simply lack the experience that adults
draw upon. Other issues that they deal with is the question of whether development occurs
through the gradual accumulation of knowledge or through shifts from one stage of thinking to
another, or if children are born with innate knowledge or figure things out through experience,
and whether development is driven by the social context or something inside each child. From
the above explanation, you may be thinking already that developmental psychology is related to
other applied fields. You are very right. The field informs several applied fields in psychology,
including, educational psychology, psychopathology, and forensic developmental psychology. It
also complements several other basic research fields in psychology including social psychology,
cognitive psychology, and comparative psychology. Lastly, it draws from the theories and
research of several scientific fields including biology, sociology, health care, nutrition, and
anthropology.

•

Explain the lifespan perspective and its assumptions about development.
Differentiate periods of human development.
Explain the issues underlying lifespan development
Identify the historical and contemporary theories impacting lifespan development

Lifespan Perspective
Paul Baltes identified several underlying principles of the lifespan perspective (Baltes, 1987;
Baltes, Lindenberger, & Staudinger, 2006).
Development is lifelong. Lifespan theorists believe that development is life-long, and change is
apparent across the lifespan. No single age period is more crucial, characterizes, or dominates
human development. Consequently, the term lifespan development will be used throughout the
textbook.
Development is multidirectional. Humans change in many directions. We may show gains in
some areas of development, while showing losses in other areas. Every change, whether it is
finishing high school, getting married, or becoming a parent, entails both growth and loss.
Development is multidimensional. We change across three general domains/dimensions;
physical, cognitive, and psychosocial. The physical domain includes changes in height and
weight, sensory capabilities, the nervous system, as well as the propensity for disease and illness.
The cognitive domain encompasses the changes in intelligence, wisdom, perception, problemsolving, memory, and language. The psychosocial domain focuses on changes in emotion, selfperception and interpersonal relationships with families, peers, and friends. All three domains
influence each other. It is also important to note that a change in one domain may cascade and
prompt changes in the other domains. For instance, an infant who has started to crawl or walk
will encounter more objects and people, thus fostering developmental change in the child’s
understanding of the physical and social world.
Development is multidisciplinary. As mentioned at the start of the chapter, human
development is such a vast topic of study that it requires the theories, research methods, and
knowledge base of many academic disciplines.
Development is characterized by plasticity. Plasticity is all about our ability to change and
that many of our characteristics are malleable. For instance, plasticity is illustrated in the
brain’s ability to learn from experience and how it can recover from injury.
Development is multicontextual. Development occurs in many contexts. Baltes (1987)
identified three specific contextual influences.

•

Normative age-graded influences: An age-grade is a specific age group, such as
toddler, adolescent, or senior. Humans in a specific age-grade share particular
experiences and developmental changes.

•

Normative history-graded
influences: The time period in
which you are born (see Table 1.1)
shapes your experiences. A cohort
is a group of people who are born
at roughly the same period in a
particular society. These people
travel through life often
experiencing similar circumstances.

Non-normative life influences: Despite sharing an age and history with our peers,
each of us also has unique experiences that may shape our development. A child who
loses his/her parent at a young age has experienced a life event that is not typical of
the age group.

Another context that influences our lives is our social standing, socioeconomic status, or social
class. Socioeconomic status (SES) is a way to identify families and households based on their
shared levels of education, income, and occupation. While there is certainly individual variation,
members of a social class tend to share similar lifestyles, patterns of consumption, parenting
styles, stressors, religious preferences, and other aspects of daily life. All of us born into a class
system are socially located, and we may move up or down depending on a combination of both
socially and individually created limits and opportunities.
Families with higher socioeconomic status usually are in occupations (e.g., attorneys, physicians,
executives) that not only pay better, but also grant them a certain degree of freedom and control
over their job. Having a sense of autonomy or control is a key factor in experiencing job
satisfaction, personal happiness, and ultimately health and well-being (Weitz, 2007). Those
families with lower socioeconomic status are typically in occupations that are more routine, more
heavily supervised, and require less formal education. These occupations are also more subject
to job disruptions, including lay-offs and lower wages.
Poverty level is an income amount established by the federal government that is based on a set
of income thresholds that vary by family size (United States Census Bureau, 2016). If a family’s
income is less than the government threshold, that family is considered in poverty. Those living
at or near poverty level may find it extremely difficult to sustain a household with this amount of
income. Poverty is associated with poorer health and a lower life expectancy due to poorer diet,
less healthcare, greater stress, working in more dangerous occupations, higher infant mortality
rates, poorer prenatal care, greater iron deficiencies, greater difficulty in school, and many other
problems. Members of higher income status may fear losing that status, but the poor may have
greater concerns over losing housing.

Today we are more aware of the
variations in development and the impact Figure 1.2
that culture and the environment have on
shaping our lives. Culture is the totality
of our shared language, knowledge,
material objects, and behavior. It
includes ideas about what is right and
wrong, what to strive for, what to eat,
how to speak, what is valued, as well as
what kinds of emotions are called for in
certain situations. Culture teaches us
how to live in a society and allows us to
advance because each new generation
can benefit from the solutions found and
Source
passed down from previous
Think of other ways culture may have affected your
generations. Culture is learned from
development. How might cultural differences influence
parents, schools, houses of worship,
interactions between teachers and students, nurses and patients,
media, friends and others throughout a
or other relationships?
lifetime. The kinds of traditions and
values that evolve in a particular culture serve to help members function and value their own
society. We tend to believe that our own culture’s practices and expectations are the right
ones. This belief that our own culture is superior is called ethnocentrism and is a normal byproduct of growing up in a culture. It becomes a roadblock, however, when it inhibits
understanding of cultural practices from other societies. Cultural relativity is an appreciation
for cultural differences and the understanding that cultural practices are best understood from
the standpoint of that particular culture.
Culture is an extremely important context for human development and understanding
development requires being able to identify which features of development are culturally
based. This understanding is somewhat new and still being explored. Much of what
developmental theorists have described in the past has been culturally bound and difficult to
apply to various cultural contexts. The reader should keep this in mind and realize that there is
still much that is unknown when comparing development across cultures.
Lifespan vs. Life expectancy: At this point you must be wondering what the difference between
lifespan and life expectancy is, according to developmentalists. Lifespan, or longevity, refers to
the length of time a species can exist under the most optimal conditions. For instance, the grey
wolf can live up to 20 years in captivity, the bald eagle up to 50 years, and the Galapagos tortoise
over 150 years (Smithsonian National Zoo, 2016). The longest recorded lifespan for a human
was Jean Calment who died in 1994 at the age of 122 years, 5 months, and 14 days (Guinness
World Records, 2016). Life expectancy is the predicted number of years a person born in a
particular time period can reasonably expect to live (Vogt & Johnson, 2016).

12

Conceptions of Age
How old are you? Chances are you would answer that question based on the number of years
since your birth, or what is called your chronological age. Ever felt older than your
chronological age? Some days we might “feel” like we are older, especially if we are not feeling
well, are tired, or are stressed out. We might notice that a peer seems more emotionally mature
than we are, or that they are physically more capable. So years since birth is not the only way we
can conceptualize age.
Biological age: Another way developmental researchers can think about the concept of age is to
examine how quickly the body is aging, this is your biological age. Several factors determine the
rate at which our body ages. Our nutrition, level of physical activity, sleeping habits, smoking,
alcohol consumption, how we mentally handle stress, and the genetic history of our ancestors, to
name but a few.

Psychological age: Our psychologically
adaptive capacity compared to others of our
chronological age is our psychological age.
This includes our cognitive capacity along
with our emotional beliefs about how old we
are. An individual who has cognitive
impairments might be 20 years of age, yet
has the mental capacity of an 8-year-old. A
70- year-old might be travelling to new
countries, taking courses at college, or
starting a new business. Compared to others
of our age group, we may be more or less
adaptive and excited to meet new challenges.
Remember you are as young or old as you
feel.

Figure 1.3 You are as young as you feel!

Source

Social age: Our social age is based on the social norms of our culture and the expectations our
culture has for people of our age group. Our culture often reminds us whether we are “on target”
or “off target” for reaching certain social milestones, such as completing our education, moving
away from home, having children, or retiring from work. However, there have been arguments
that social age is becoming less relevant in the 21st century (Neugarten, 1979; 1996). If you look
around at your fellow students in your courses at college you might notice more people who are
older than the more traditional aged college students, those 18 to 25. Similarly, the age at which
people are moving away from the home of their parents, starting their careers, getting married or
having children, or even whether they get married or have children at all, is changing.
Those who study lifespan development recognize that chronological age does not completely
capture a person’s age. Our age profile is much more complex than this. A person may be
physically more competent than others in their age group, while being psychologically immature.
So, how old are you?

Table 1.2 reflects unique aspects of the various stages of childhood and adulthood that will be
explored in this book. So, while both an 8-month old and an 8-year-old are considered children,
they have very different motor abilities, social relationships, and cognitive skills. Their
nutritional needs are different and their primary psychological concerns are also distinctive. The
same is true of an 18-year-old and an 80-year-old, as both are considered adults.
Prenatal Development: Conception occurs and development begins. All of the major structures
of the body are forming, and the health of the mother is of primary concern. Understanding
nutrition, teratogens, or environmental factors that can lead to birth defects, and labor and
delivery are primary concerns.
Figure 1.4

Infancy and Toddlerhood: The first two years of life are ones of
dramatic growth and change. A newborn, with a keen sense of
hearing but very poor vision, is transformed into a walking, talking
toddler within a relatively short period of time. Caregivers are also
transformed from someone who manages feeding and sleep
schedules to a constantly moving guide and safety inspector for a
mobile, energetic child.

Early Childhood: This period is also referred to as the preschool years and consists of the years
which follow toddlerhood and precede formal schooling. As a two to six-year-old, the child is

busy learning language, is gaining a sense of self and greater independence, and is beginning to
learn the workings of the physical world.
Middle and Late Childhood: The ages of six to the onset of puberty comprise middle and late
childhood, and much of what children experience at this age is connected to their involvement in
the early grades of school. Now the world becomes one of learning and testing new academic
skills and by assessing one’s abilities and accomplishments by making comparisons between self
and others.
Adolescence: Adolescence is a period of dramatic physical change marked by an overall growth
spurt and sexual maturation, known as puberty. It is also a time of cognitive change as the
adolescent begins to think of new possibilities and to consider abstract concepts such as love,
fear, and freedom. Ironically, adolescents have a sense of invincibility that puts them at greater
risk of dying from accidents or contracting sexually transmitted infections that can have lifelong
consequences.
Emerging Adulthood: The period of emerging adulthood is a transitional time between the end
of adolescence and before individuals acquire all the benchmarks of adulthood. Continued
identity exploration and preparation for full independence from parents are demonstrated.
Although at one’s physiological peak, emerging adults are most at risk for involvement in violent
crimes and substance abuse.
Early Adulthood: The twenties and thirties are identified
as early adulthood. Intimate relationships, establishing
families, and work are primary concerns at this stage of
life.

Figure 1.5

Middle Adulthood: The forties through the mid-sixties is
referred to as middle adulthood. This is a period in which
aging becomes more noticeable and when many people
are at their peak of productivity in love and work.
Late Adulthood: Late adulthood is sometimes
subdivided into two categories: The young-old who are
from 65-84 years and the oldest-old who are 85 years and
older. One of the primary differences between these
groups is that the young-old are still relatively healthy,
productive, active, and the majority continue to live
independently. With both age groups the risks of diseases
such as, arteriosclerosis, cancer, and cerebral vascular
disease increases substantially.

Issues in Lifespan Development
Nature and Nurture: Why are you the way you are? As you consider some of your features
(height, weight, personality, being diabetic, etc.), ask yourself whether these features are a result
of heredity or environmental factors, or both. Chances are, you can see the ways in which both
heredity and environmental factors (such as lifestyle, diet, and so on) have contributed to these
features. For decades, scholars have carried on the "nature/nurture" debate. For any particular
feature, those on the side of nature would argue that heredity plays the most important role in
bringing about that feature. Those on the side of nurture would argue that one's environment is
most significant in shaping the way we are. This debate continues in all aspects of human
development, and most scholars agree that there is a constant interplay between the two forces. It
is difficult to isolate the root of any single behavior as a result solely of nature or nurture.
Continuity versus

as a slow, gradual process, or is
it best viewed as one of more
abrupt change? The answer to
that question often depends on
which developmental theorist
you ask and what topic is being
studied. The theories of Freud,
Erikson, Piaget, and Kohlberg
are called stage theories. Stage
theories or discontinuous
development assume that

developmental change often
occurs in distinct stages that
are qualitatively different from each other, and in a set, universal sequence. At each stage of
development, children and adults have different qualities and characteristics. Thus, stage
theorists assume development is more discontinuous. Others, such as the behaviorists,
Vygotsky, and information processing theorists, assume development is a more slow and gradual
process known as continuous development. For instance, they would see the adult as not
possessing new skills, but more advanced skills that were already present in some form in the
child. Brain development and environmental experiences contribute to the acquisition of more
developed skills.
Figure 1.6

Active versus Passive: How much do you play a role in your own developmental path? Are you
at the whim of your genetic inheritance or the environment that surrounds you? Some theorists
see humans as playing a much more active role in their own development. Piaget, for instance
believed that children actively explore their world and construct new ways of thinking to explain
the things they experience. In contrast, many behaviorists view humans as being more passive in
the developmental process.

16

Stability versus Change: How similar are you to how you were as a child? Were you always as
out-going or reserved as you are now? Some theorists argue that the personality traits of adults
are rooted in the behavioral and emotional tendencies of the infant and young child. Others
disagree, and believe that these initial tendencies are modified by social and cultural forces over
time.

Historical Theories on Development
Preformationist View: Well into the 18th century, children
were merely thought of as little adults. Preformationism, or
the belief that a tiny, fully formed human is implanted in the
sperm or egg at conception and then grows in size until birth,
was the predominant early theory. Children were believed to
possess all their sensory capabilities, emotions, and mental
aptitude at birth, and as they developed these abilities unfolded
on a predetermined schedule (Thomas, 1979). The environment
was thought to play no role in determining development.

Figure 1.7

John Locke (1632-1704): Locke, a British philosopher, refuted
the idea of innate knowledge and instead proposed that children

are largely shaped by their social environments, especially their
education as adults teach them important knowledge. He
believed that through education a child learns socialization, or what is needed to be an
appropriate member of society. Locke advocated thinking of a child’s mind as a tabula rasa or
blank slate, and whatever comes into the child’s mind comes from the environment. Locke
emphasized that the environment is especially powerful in the child’s early life because he
considered the mind the most pliable then. Locke indicated that the environment exerts its
effects through associations between thoughts and feelings, behavioral repetition, imitation, and
rewards and punishments (Crain, 2005). Locke’s ideas laid the groundwork for the behavioral
perspective and subsequent learning theories of Pavlov, Skinner and Bandura.
Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778): Like Locke, Rousseau also believed that children were
not just little adults. However, he did not believe they were blank slates, but instead developed
according to a natural plan which unfolded in different stages (Crain, 2005). He did not believe
in teaching them the correct way to think, but believed children should be allowed to think by
themselves according to their own ways and an inner, biological timetable. This focus on
biological maturation resulted in Rousseau being considered the father of developmental
psychology. Followers of Rousseau’s developmental perspective include Gesell, Montessori,
and Piaget.
Arnold Gesell (1880-1961): Gesell spent 50 years at the Yale Clinic of Child Development, and
with his colleagues he studied the neuromotor development of children. Gesell believed that the
child’s development was activated by genes and he called this process maturation (Crain, 2005).
Further, he believed that development unfolded in fixed sequences, and he opposed efforts to
teach children ahead of schedule as he believed they will engage in behaviors when their nervous
systems had sufficiently matured.

Sigmund Freud from Wikimedia

Sigmund Freud (1856-1939): Freud was a very influential
figure in the area of development. Freud emphasized the
importance of early childhood experiences in shaping our
personality and behavior. In our natural state, we are biological
beings and are driven primarily by instincts. During childhood,
however, we begin to become social beings as we learn how to
manage our instincts and transform them into socially
acceptable behaviors. His assumptions were that personality
formed during the first few years of life. The ways in which
parents or other caregivers interacted with children were
assumed to have a long-lasting impact on children’s emotional
states. His beliefs formed the psychodynamic perspective and
his theories of psychosexual development and psychopathology
dominated the field of psychiatry until the growth of
behaviorism in the 1950s.

However, Freud’s theory has been heavily criticized for several reasons. One is that it is very
difficult to test scientifically (Crews, 1998). Freud suggested that much of what determines our
actions were unknown to us, and as scientists we cannot measure these unconscious concepts. A
second criticism is that Freud’s case studies were not validated and cannot be used as evidence
for his theories. Many later theories, particularly behaviorism and humanism, came about as
challenges to Freud’s views.

Contemporary Theories on Development
Figure 1.9

Erikson (1902-1994) and Psychosocial Theory: Now, let's turn to a
less controversial psychodynamic theorist, Erik Erikson. Erikson
presents eight developmental stages that encompass the entire
lifespan. For that reason, Erikson’s psychosocial theory forms the
foundation for much of our discussion of psychosocial development.

Erikson (1950) proposed a model of lifespan development that
provides a useful guideline for thinking about the changes we
experience throughout life. Erikson broke with Freud’s emphasis on
sexuality as the cornerstone of social-emotional development and
instead suggested that social relationships fostered development.
Erikson proposed that each period of life has a unique challenge or
crisis that the person who reaches it must face, referred to as
psychosocial crises. According to Erikson, successful development
Erik Erikson
involves dealing with and resolving the goals and demands of each of
these psychosocial crises in a positive way. These crises are usually
called stages, although that is not the term Erikson used. If a person does not resolve a stage
successfully, it may hinder their ability to deal with later stages. For example, the person who
does not develop a sense of trust (Erikson’s first stage) may find it challenging as an adult to
form a positive intimate relationship (Erikson’s sixth stage). Or an individual who does not
develop a clear sense of purpose and identity (Erikson’s fifth stage) may become self-absorbed
and stagnate rather than work toward the betterment of others (Erikson’s seventh stage).
18

However, most individuals are able to successfully complete the eight stages of his theory (See
Table 1.3).

Erikson’s theory has been criticized for focusing so heavily on crises and assuming that the
completion of one crisis is a prerequisite for the next crisis of development. His theory also
focused on the social expectations that are found in certain cultures, but not in all. For instance,
the idea that adolescence is a time of searching for identity might translate well in the middleclass culture of the United States, but not as well in cultures where the transition into adulthood
coincides with puberty through rites of passage and where adult roles offer fewer choices.
Learning Theory: Also known as Behaviorism, is based on the premise that it is not possible to
objectively study the mind, and therefore psychologists should limit their attention to the study of
behavior itself. The most famous behaviorist was Burrhus Frederick (B. F.) Skinner (1904–
1990), who expanded the principles of behaviorism and also brought them to the attention of the
public at large. Skinner used the ideas of stimulus and response, along with the application of
rewards or reinforcements, to train pigeons and other animals. In addition, he used the general
principles of behaviorism to develop theories about how best to teach children and how to create
societies that were peaceful and productive (Skinner, 1957, 1968, 1972).
The behaviorists made substantial contributions to psychology by identifying the principles of
learning. Although the behaviorists were incorrect in their beliefs that it was not possible to
measure thoughts and feelings, their ideas provided new insights that helped further our
understanding regarding the nature-nurture debate as well as the question of free will. The ideas
of behaviorism are fundamental to psychology and have been developed to help us better
understand the role of prior experiences in a variety of areas of psychology.
19

Social Learning Theory, or learning by watching others, was developed by Albert Bandura
(1977). His theory calls our attention to the ways in which many of our actions are not learned
through conditioning, as suggested by Skinner. Young children frequently learn behaviors
through imitation. Especially when children do not know what else to do, they learn by modeling
or copying the behavior of others.
Bandura (1986) suggests that there is interplay between the environment and the individual. We
are not just the product of our surroundings, rather we influence our surroundings. There is
interplay between our personality and the way we interpret events and how they influence us.
This concept is called reciprocal determinism. An example of this might be the interplay
between parents and children. Parents not only influence their child's environment, perhaps
intentionally through the use of reinforcement, etc., but children influence parents as
well. Parents may respond differently with their first child than with their fourth. Perhaps they
try to be the perfect parents with their firstborn, but by the time their last child comes along they
have very different expectations, both of themselves and their child. Our environment creates us
and we create our environment.
Other social influences: TV or not TV? Bandura, Ross and Ross (1963)
began a series of studies to look at the impact of television on the behavior
of children. Bandura began by conducting an experiment in which he
showed children a film of a woman hitting an inflatable clown or “bobo”
doll. Then the children were allowed in the room, where they found the doll
and during their play they began to hit it. The children also demonstrated
novel ways of being aggressive toward the doll that were not demonstrated
by those children who did not see the aggressive model. Bandura’s
research raised concerns about the impact of violence on young children.
Since then, considerable research has been conducted on the impact of
violent media on children’s aggression including playing video games.

Cognitive Theory: The cognitive theories focus on how our mental
processes or cognitions change over time. Three important theories are Jean Piaget’s, Lev
Vygotsky’s, and Information-processing.
Jean Piaget (1896-1980) was one of the most influential cognitive theorists in development. He
was inspired to explore children’s ability to think and reason by watching his own children’s
development. He was one of the first to recognize and map out the ways in which children's
intelligence differs from that of adults (Piaget, 1929). He became interested in this area when he
was asked to test the IQ of children and began to notice that there was a pattern in their wrong
answers. He believed that children's intellectual skills change over time and that maturation,
rather than training, brings about that change. Children of differing ages interpret the world
differently. Piaget theorized that children progressed through four stages of cognitive
development (see Table 1.4).

Abstract logic

Piaget has been criticized for overemphasizing the role that physical maturation plays in
cognitive development and in underestimating the role that culture and experience plays.
Looking across cultures reveals considerable variation in what children are able to do at various
ages. Research has shown considerable overlap among the four stages and that development is
more continuous.
Lev Vygotsky (1896-1934) was a Russian psychologist who wrote in the early 1900s, but whose
work was not discovered by researchers in the United States until the 1960s and became more
widely known in the 1980s (Crain, 2005). His sociocultural theory emphasizes the importance
of culture and interaction in the development of cognitive abilities. Vygotsky differed with
Piaget in that he believed that a person not only has a set of abilities, but also a set of potential
abilities that can be realized if given the proper guidance from others. Vygotsky developed
theories on teaching that have been adopted by educators today.
Information Processing is not the work of a single theorist, but based on the ideas and research
of several cognitive scientists studying how individuals perceive, analyze, manipulate, use, and
remember information. This approach assumes that humans gradually improve in their
processing skills; that is, cognitive development is continuous rather than stage-like. The more
complex mental skills of adults are built from the primitive abilities of children. We are born
with the ability to notice stimuli, store, and retrieve information. Brain maturation enables
advancements in our information processing system. At the same time, interactions with the
environment also aid in our development of more effective strategies for processing information.
Urie Bronfenbrenner (1917-2005) developed the Ecological Systems Theory, which provides
a framework for understanding and studying the many influences on human development
(Bronfenbrenner, 1979). Bronfenbrenner recognized that human interaction is influenced by
21

larger social forces and that an understanding of these forces is essential for understanding an
individual. The individual is impacted by several systems including:
o Microsystem includes the individual’s setting and those who have direct, significant
contact with the person, such as parents or siblings. The input of those is modified by the
cognitive and biological state of the individual as well. These influence the person’s
actions, which in turn influence systems operating on him or her.
o Mesosystem includes the larger organizational structures, such as school, the family, or
religion. These institutions impact the microsystems just described. The philosophy of
the school system, daily routine, assessment methods, and other characteristics can affect
the child’s self-image, growth, sense of accomplishment, and schedule thereby impacting
the child, physically, cognitively, and emotionally.
o Exosystem includes the larger contexts of community. A community’s values, history,
and economy can impact the organizational structures it houses. Mesosystems both
influence and are influenced by the exosystem.
o Macrosystem includes the cultural elements, such as global economic conditions, war,
technological trends, values, philosophies, and a society’s responses to the global
community.
o Chronosystem is the historical context in which these experiences occur. This relates to
the different generational time periods previously discussed, such as the baby boomers
and millennials.
In sum, a child’s experiences are shaped by larger forces, such as the family, schools, religion,
culture, and time period. Bronfenbrenner’s model helps us understand all of the different
environments that impact each one of us simultaneously. Despite its comprehensiveness,
Bronfenbrenner’s ecological system’s theory is not easy to use. Taking into consideration all the
different influences makes it difficult to research and determine the impact of all the different
variables (Dixon, 2003). Consequently, psychologists have not fully adopted this approach,
although they recognize the importance of the ecology of the individual. Figure 1.11 is a model
of Bronfenbrenner’s Ecological Systems Theory.

Explain ways to conduct ethical research

An important part of learning any science, including psychology, is having a basic knowledge of
the techniques used in gathering information. The hallmark of scientific investigation is that of
following a set of procedures designed to keep questioning or skepticism alive while describing,
explaining, or testing any phenomenon. Science involves continuously renewing our
understanding of the subjects in question and an ongoing investigation of how and why events
occur. The scientific method is the set of assumptions, rules, and procedures scientists use to
conduct research.
A research design is the specific method a researcher uses to collect, analyze, and interpret
data. Psychologists use three major types of research designs in their research, and each provides
an essential avenue for scientific investigation. Descriptive research is research that describes
what is occurring at a particular point in time. Correlational research is research designed to
discover relationships among variables and to allow the prediction of future events from present
knowledge. Experimental research is research in which a researcher manipulates one or more
variables to see their effects. Each of the three research designs varies according to its strengths
and limitations.

Descriptive Research
Case Study: Sometimes the data in a descriptive research project are based on only a small set
of individuals, often only one person or a single small group. These research designs are known
as case studies which are descriptive records of one or a small group of individuals’
experiences and behavior. Sometimes case studies involve ordinary individuals. Developmental
psychologist Jean Piaget observed his own children. More frequently, case studies are
conducted on individuals who have unusual or abnormal experiences. The assumption is that by
carefully studying these individuals, we can learn something about human nature. Case studies
have a distinct disadvantage in that, although it allows us to get an idea of what is currently
happening, it is usually limited to static pictures. Although descriptions of particular
experiences may be interesting, they are not always transferable to other individuals in similar
situations. They are also time consuming and expensive as many professionals are involved in
gathering the information.
Observations: Another type of descriptive research is known as observation. When using
naturalistic observation, psychologists observe and record behavior that occurs in everyday
settings. For instance, a developmental psychologist might watch children on a playground and

24

describe what they say to each other. However, naturalistic observations do not allow the
researcher to have any control over the environment.
Laboratory observation, unlike the naturalistic observation, is conducted in a setting created by
the researcher. This permits the researcher to control more aspects of the situation. One example
of laboratory observation involves a systematic procedure known as the strange situation test,
which you will learn about in chapter three. Concerns regarding laboratory observations are that
the participants are aware that they are being watched, and there is no guarantee that the behavior
demonstrated in the laboratory will generalize to the real world.
Survey: In other cases, the data from
descriptive research projects come in the
form of a survey, which is a measure
administered through either a verbal or
written questionnaire to get a picture of the
beliefs or behaviors of a sample of people of
interest. The people chosen to participate in
the research, known as the sample, are
selected to be representative of all the people
that the researcher wishes to know about
called the population. A representative
sample would include the same percentages
of males, females, age groups, ethnic groups,
and socio-economic groups as the larger
population.

Figure 1.12
How many surveys have you taken?

Source

Surveys gather information from many individuals in a short period of time, which is the greatest
benefit for surveys. Additionally, surveys are inexpensive to administer. However, surveys
typically yield surface information on a wide variety of factors but may not allow for in-depth
understanding of human behavior. Another problem is that respondents may lie because they
want to present themselves in the most favorable light, known as social desirability. They also
may be embarrassed to answer truthfully or are worried that their results will not be kept
confidential. Additionally, questions can be perceived differently than intended.
Interviews: Rather than surveying participants, they can be interviewed which means they are
directly questioned by a researcher. Interviewing participants on their behaviors or beliefs can
solve the problem of misinterpreting the questions posed on surveys. The examiner can explain
the questions and further probe responses for greater clarity and understanding. Although this
can yield more accurate results, interviews take longer and are more expensive to administer than
surveys. Participants can also demonstrate social desirability, which will affect the accuracy of
the responses.
Psychophysiological Assessment: Researchers may also record psychophysiological data, such
as measures of heart rate, hormone levels, or brain activity to help explain development. These
measures may be recorded by themselves or in combination with behavioral data to better
understand the bidirectional relations between biology and behavior. Special equipment has been
developed to allow researchers to record the brain activity of very young and very small research
25

subjects. One manner of understanding associations between brain development and behavioral
advances is through the recording of event-related potentials (ERPs). ERPs are recorded by
fitting a research participant with a stretchy cap that contains many small sensors or electrodes.
These electrodes record tiny electrical currents on the scalp of the participant in response to the
presentation of stimuli, such as a picture or a sound.
Figure 1.13

Source

The use of ERPs has provided important insight as to how
infants and children understand the world around them.
Webb, Dawson, Bernier, and Panagiotides (2006) examined
face and object processing in children with autism spectrum
disorders, those with developmental delays, and those who
were typically developing. The children wore electrode caps
and had their brain activity recorded as they watched still
photographs of faces of their mother or of a stranger, and
objects, including those that were familiar or unfamiliar to
them. The researchers examined differences in face and
object processing by group by observing a component of the
brainwaves. Findings suggest that children with autism are
in some way processing faces differently than typically
developing children and those with more general
developmental delays.

Secondary/Content Analysis involves analyzing information that has already been collected or
examining documents or media to uncover attitudes, practices or preferences. There are a
number of data sets available to those who wish to conduct this type of research. For example,
the U. S. Census Data is available and widely used to look at trends and changes taking place in
the United States. The researcher conducting secondary analysis does not have to recruit
subjects, but does need to know the quality of the information collected in the original study.

Correlational Research
In contrast to descriptive research, which is designed primarily to provide static pictures,
correlational research involves the measurement of two or more relevant variables and an
assessment of the relationship between or among those variables. For instance, the variables of
height and weight are systematically related (correlated) because taller people generally weigh
more than shorter people.
The Pearson Correlation Coefficient, symbolized by the letter r, is the most common statistical
measure of the strength of linear relationships among variables. The value of the correlation
coefficient ranges from r= –1.00 to r = +1.00. The strength of the linear relationship is indexed
by the distance of the correlation coefficient from zero (its absolute value). For instance, r = –.54
is a stronger relationship than r= .30, and r = .72 is a stronger relationship than r = –.57. The
direction of the linear relationship is indicated by the sign of the correlation coefficient. Positive
values of r (such as r = .54 or r = .67) indicate that the relationship is positive (i.e., the pattern of
the dots on the scatter plot runs from the lower left to the upper right), whereas negative values
26

of r (such as r = –.30 or r = –.72) indicate negative relationships (i.e., the dots run from the upper
left to the lower right).
When the straight line indicates that
individuals who have high values for one
Figure 1.14
variable also tend to have high values for
the other variable, as in part (a), the
relationship is said to be a positive
correlation. Examples of positive
correlations include those between
education and income, and between age
and mathematical abilities in children. In
each case people who score higher on one
of the variables also tend to score higher
on the other variable. Negative
correlations, in contrast, as shown in
part (b), occur when high values for one
variable tend to be associated with low

scatter plots. Source:
values for the other variable. Examples
of negative correlations include those
between the age of a child and the number of diapers the child uses, and between practice and
errors made on a learning task. In these cases, people who score higher on one of the variables
tend to score lower on the other variable.
An important limitation of correlational research designs is that they cannot be used to draw
conclusions about the causal relationships among the measured variables. Consider, for instance,
a researcher who has hypothesized that viewing violent behavior will cause increased aggressive
play in children. He has collected, from a sample of fourth-grade children, a measure of how
much violent television each child views during the week, as well as a measure of how
aggressively each child plays. The researcher discovers a positive correlation between the two
measured variables. Although this positive correlation appears to support the hypothesis, it
cannot be taken to indicate that viewing violent television causes aggressive behavior as there are
other possible explanations. One alternative is that children who behaved aggressively at school
want to watch violent television shows. Still another possible explanation for the observed
correlation is that it has been produced by the presence of a third variable.
A third variable is a variable that is not part
of the research hypothesis but produces the
observed correlation between them. In our
example a potential third variable is the
discipline style of the children’s parents.
Parents who use a harsh and punitive
discipline style may produce children who
both like to watch violent television and who
behave aggressively in comparison to
children whose parents use less harsh
discipline.

Figure 1.15

27

For this reason, we are left with the basic limitation of correlational research: Correlation does
not demonstrate causation! It is important that when you read about correlational research
projects, you keep in mind the possibility of third variables.
Strengths and limitations: Correlational research can be used when experimental research is
not possible because the variables cannot be manipulated or it would be unethical to use an
experiment. Correlational designs also have the advantage of allowing the researcher to study
behavior as it occurs in everyday life. We can also use correlational designs to make predictions.
For instance, we can predict from the scores on a battery of tests the success of job trainees
during a training session. However, we cannot use such correlational information to determine
whether one variable caused another variable. For that, researchers rely on an experiment.

Experimental Research
The goal of the experimental method is to provide more definitive conclusions about the causal
relationships among the variables in a research hypothesis than what is available from
correlational research. Experiments are designed to test hypotheses, or specific statements about
the relationship between variables. Experiments are conducted in a controlled setting in an effort
to explain how certain factors or events produce outcomes. A variable is anything that changes
in value. In the experimental research design, the variables of interest are called the independent
variable and the dependent variable. The independent variable in an experiment is the causing
variable that is created or manipulated by the experimenter. The dependent variable in an
experiment is a measured variable that is expected to be influenced by the experimental
manipulation.
A good experiment randomly assigns participants to at least two groups that are compared. The
experimental group receives the treatment under investigation, while the control group does not
receive the treatment the experimenter is studying as a comparison. For instance, to assess
whether violent TV affects aggressive behavior the experimental group might view a violent
television show, while the control group watches a non-violent show. Additionally, experimental
designs control for extraneous variables, or variables that are not part of the experiment that
could inadvertently affect either the experimental or control group, thus distorting the results.
Despite the advantage of determining causation, experiments do have limitations. One is that
they are often conducted in laboratory situations rather than in the everyday lives of people.
Therefore, we do not know whether results that we find in a laboratory setting will necessarily
hold up in everyday life. Second, and more important, is that some of the most interesting and
key social variables cannot be experimentally manipulated because of ethical concerns. If we
want to study the influence of abuse on children’s development of depression, these relationships
must be assessed using correlational designs because it is simply not ethical to experimentally
manipulate these variables. Characteristics of descriptive, correlational, and experimental
research designs can be found in Table 1.5.

Research Involving Time-Spans
Cross-sectional research compares samples that
represent a cross-section of the population who vary
in age. Participants might be asked to complete a
survey or take a test of some physical or cognitive
skill. The attitudes or skill levels based on age are
compared. In cross-sectional research, respondents
are measured only once, and consequently this
method is not expensive or time consuming. In
addition, because participants are only tested at one
point in time, practice effects are not an issue as
children do not have the opportunity to become better
at the task over time. There is also no need to keep in
contact with, or follow-up with, participants over time.

Figure 1.16 Cross-Sectional

Source

However, cross-sectional research does not allow the researcher to look at the impact of having
been born in a certain time-period, which is known as the cohort effect. For example, those born
during the depression have very different views about and experiences with the internet than

29

those born in the last twenty years. Different attitudes about the Internet, for example, might not
be due to a person’s biological age as much as their life experiences as members of a cohort.
Longitudinal research involves studying a group of people who are the same age, and
measuring them repeatedly over a period-of-time. This type of design allows researchers to study
individual differences in development. Longitudinal studies may be conducted over the short
term, such as a span of months, or over much longer durations including years or decades. For
these reasons, longitudinal research designs are optimal for studying stability and change over
time.
Figure 1.17 Longitudinal Research

Source

Problems with longitudinal research include being very time consuming and expensive.
Researchers must maintain continued contact with participants over time, and these studies
necessitate that scientists have funding to conduct their work over extended durations. An
additional risk is attrition. Attrition occurs when participants fail to complete all portions of a
study. Participants may move, change their phone numbers, or simply become disinterested in
participating over time. Researchers should account for the possibility of attrition by enrolling a
larger sample into their study initially, as some participants will likely drop out over time. Even
with a large sample size, the experimenter never knows if there was something different about
the individuals who dropped out versus those that remained in the study.
The results from longitudinal studies may also be impacted by repeated assessments. Consider
how well you would do on a math test if you were given the exact same exam every day for a
week. Your performance would likely improve over time not necessarily because you developed
better math abilities, but because you were continuously practicing the same math problems.
This phenomenon is known as a practice effect. Practice effects occur when participants
become better at a task over time because they have done it again and again; not due to natural
psychological development.
Sequential research includes elements of both longitudinal and cross-sectional research
designs. Similar to longitudinal designs, sequential research features participants who are
followed over time; similar to cross-sectional designs, sequential work includes participants of
different ages. This research design is also distinct from those that have been discussed
previously in that individuals of different ages are enrolled into a study at various points in time

30

to examine age-related changes, development within the same individuals as they age, and
account for the possibility of cohort effects.

Figure 1.18 Sequential Research

Source

For example, in a study with a sequential design, a researcher might enroll three separate groups
of children (Groups A, B, and C). Children in Group A would be enrolled when they are 2 years
old and would be tested again when they are 4 and 6 years old. This is similar in design to the
longitudinal study described previously. Children in Group B would also be enrolled when they
are 2 years old, but this would occur two years later when Group A is now 4 years old. Finally,
children in Group C would be enrolled when they are 2 years old and Group A is now 6 and
Group B is now 4. At this time, the children would represent a cross-sectional design (2, 4, and
6 years of age). Further, along the diagonal children of the same age can be compared to
determine if cohort effects are evident. Sequential designs are appealing because they allow
researchers to learn a lot about development in a relatively short amount of time.
Because they include elements of longitudinal and cross-sectional designs, sequential research
has many of the same strengths and limitations as these other approaches. For example,
sequential work may require less time and effort than longitudinal research, but more time and
effort than cross-sectional research. Although practice effects may be an issue if participants are
asked to complete the same tasks or assessments over time, attrition may be less problematic
than what is commonly experienced in longitudinal research since participants may not have to
remain involved in the study for such a long period-of-time. Table 1.6 identifies advantages and
disadvantages for each of the described time span research design.

Conducting Ethical Research
One of the issues that all scientists must address concerns the ethics of their research. Research in
psychology may cause some stress, harm, or inconvenience for the people who participate in that
research. Psychologists may induce stress, anxiety, or negative moods in their participants,
expose them to weak electrical shocks, or convince them to behave in ways that violate their
moral standards. Additionally, researchers may sometimes use animals, potentially harming
them in the process.
Decisions about whether research is ethical are made using established ethical codes developed
by scientific organizations, such as the American Psychological Association, and federal
governments. In the United States, the Department of Health and Human Services provides the
guidelines for ethical standards in research. The following are the American Psychological
Association code of ethics when using humans in research (APA, 2016).
•

No Harm: The most direct ethical concern of the scientist is to prevent harm to the
research participants.

•

Informed Consent: Researchers must obtain informed consent, which explains as much
as possible about the true nature of the study, particularly everything that might be
32

expected to influence willingness to participate. Participants can withdraw their consent
to participate at any point.
Infants and young children cannot verbally indicate their willingness to participate, much
less understand the balance of potential risks and benefits. As such, researchers are
oftentimes required to obtain written informed consent from the parent or legal guardian
of the child participant. Further, this adult is almost always present as the study is
conducted. Children are not asked to indicate whether they would like to be involved in a
study until they are approximately seven years old. Because infants and young children
also cannot easily indicate if they would like to discontinue their participation in a study,
researchers must be sensitive to changes in the state of the participant, such as
determining whether a child is too tired or upset to continue, as well as to what the parent
desires. In some cases, parents might want to discontinue their involvement in the
research. As in adult studies, researchers must always strive to protect the rights and wellbeing of the minor participants and their parents when conducting developmental
research.
•

Confidentiality: Researchers must also protect the privacy of the research participants’
responses by not using names or other information that could identify the participants.

•

Deception: Deception occurs whenever research participants are not completely and
fully informed about the nature of the research project before participating in it.
Deception may occur when the researcher tells the participants that a study is about one
thing when in fact it is about something else, or when participants are not told about the
hypothesis.

•

Debriefing: At the end of a study debriefing, which is a procedure designed to fully
explain the purposes and procedures of the research and remove any harmful aftereffects
of participation, must occur.

Chapter 2: Heredity, Prenatal Development, and Birth
In this chapter, we will begin by examining some of the ways in which heredity helps to shape
the way we are. We will look at what happens genetically during conception, and describe some
known genetic and chromosomal disorders. Next, we will consider what happens during
prenatal development, including the impact of teratogens. We will also discuss the impact that
both the mother and father have on the developing fetus. Lastly, we will present the birth
process and some of the complications that can occur during delivery. Before going into these
topics, however, it is important to understand how genes and chromosomes affect development.

Heredity
As your recall from chapter one, nature refers to the
contribution of genetics to one’s development. The basic
building block of the nature perspective is the gene. Genes
are specific sequence of nucleotides and are recipes for
making proteins. Proteins are responsible for influencing the
structure and functions of cells. Genes are located on the
chromosomes and there are an estimated 20,500 genes for
humans, according to the Human Genome Project (NIH,
2015). See Box 2.2 at the end of this section for more details
on the Human Genome Project.

Figure 2.1

Source

Normal human cells contain 46 chromosomes (or 23 pairs; one from each parent) in the nucleus
of the cells. After conception, most cells of the body are created by a process called mitosis.
Mitosis is defined as the cell’s nucleus making an exact copy of all the chromosomes and
splitting into two new cells. However, the cells used in sexual reproduction, called the gametes
(sperm or ova), are formed in a process called meiosis. In meiosis the gamete’s chromosomes
duplicate, and then divide twice resulting in four cells containing only half the genetic material
of the original gamete. Thus, each sperm and egg possesses only 23 chromosomes and combine
to produce the normal 46. See Figure 2.2 for details on both mitosis and meiosis. Given the
35

amount of genes present and the unpredictability of the meiosis process, the likelihood of having
offspring that are genetically identical (and not twins) is one in trillions (Gould & Keeton,
1997).
Of the 23 pairs of chromosomes
created at conception, 22 pairs are
similar in length. These are called
autosomes. The remaining pair, or
sex chromosomes, may differ in
length. If a child receives the
combination of XY the child will be
genetically male. If the child
receives the combination XX the
child will be genetically female.

Figure 2.2 Mitosis vs. Meiosis

Genotypes and Phenotypes
The word genotype refers to the
sum total of all the genes a person
inherits. The word phenotype
refers to the features that are
actually expressed. Look in the
mirror. What do you see, your
genotype or your phenotype? What
determines whether or not genes are
expressed? Because genes are
inherited in pairs on the
chromosomes, we may receive
either the same version of a gene from our mother and father, that is, be homozygous for that
characteristic the gene influences. If we receive a different version of the gene from each parent,
that is referred to as heterozygous. In the homozygous situation we will display that
characteristic. It is in the heterozygous condition that it becomes clear that not all genes are
created equal. Some genes are dominant, meaning they express themselves in the phenotype
even when paired with a different version of the gene, while their silent partner is called
recessive. Recessive genes express themselves only when paired with a similar version gene.
Geneticists refer to different versions of a gene as alleles. Some dominant traits include having
facial dimples, curly hair, normal vision, and dark hair. Some recessive traits include red hair,
being nearsighted, and straight hair.
Most characteristics are not the result of a single gene; they are polygenic, meaning they are the
result of several genes. In addition, the dominant and recessive patterns described above are
usually not that simple either. Sometimes the dominant gene does not completely suppress the
recessive gene; this is called incomplete dominance. An example of this can be found in the
recessive gene disorder sickle cell disease. The gene that produces healthy round-shaped red
blood cells is dominant. The recessive gene causes an abnormality in the shape of red blood
cells; they take on a sickle form, which can clog the veins and deprive vital organs of oxygen and
36

increase the risk of stroke. To inherit the disorder a person must receive the recessive gene from
both parents. Those who have inherited only one recessive-gene are called carriers and should
be unaffected by this recessive trait. Yet, carriers of sickle cell have some red blood cells that
take on the c-shaped sickle pattern. Under circumstances of oxygen deprivation, such as high
altitudes or physical exertion, carriers for the sickle cell gene may experience some of the
symptoms of sickle cell (Berk, 2004).
Box 2.1 Monozygotic and Dizygotic Twins
Many students are interested in twins. Monozygotic or identical twins occur when a
fertilized egg splits apart in the first two weeks of development. The result is the
creation of two separate, but genetically identical offspring. That is, they possess the
same genotype and often the same phenotype. About one-third of twins are
monozygotic twins. Sometimes, however, two eggs or ova are released and fertilized
by two separate sperm. The result is dizygotic or fraternal twins. These two
individuals share the same amount of genetic material as would any two children
from the same mother and father. In other words, they possess a different genotype
and phenotype. Older mothers are more likely to have dizygotic twins than are
younger mothers, and couples who use fertility drugs are also more likely to give
birth to dizygotic twins. Consequently, there has been an increase in the number of
fraternal twins recently (Bortolus et al., 1999).

Genetic Disorders
Most of the known genetic disorders are dominant gene-linked; however, the vast majority of
dominant gene linked disorders are not serious or debilitating. For example, the majority of those
with Tourette's Syndrome suffer only minor tics from time to time and can easily control their
symptoms. Huntington's Disease is a dominant gene linked disorder that affects the nervous
system and is fatal, but does not appear until midlife. Recessive gene disorders, such as cystic
fibrosis and sickle-cell anemia, are less common, but may actually claim more lives because they
are less likely to be detected as people are unaware that they are carriers of the disease. Some
genetic disorders are sex-linked; the defective gene is found on the X-chromosome. Males have
only one X chromosome so are at greater risk for sex-linked disorders due to a recessive gene,
37

such as hemophilia, color-blindness, and baldness. For females to be affected by the genetic
defects, they need to inherit the recessive gene on both X-chromosomes, but if the defective gene
is dominant, females can be equally at risk. Table 2.1 lists several genetic disorders.
Table 2.1 Genetic Disorders
Recessive Disorders (Homozygous): The individual inherits a gene change from both
parents. If the gene is inherited from just one parent, the person is a carrier and does
not have the condition.
• Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is a condition in which the red blood cells in the body
are shaped like a sickle (like the letter C) and affect the ability of the blood to
transport oxygen. Carriers may experience some effects, but do not have the full
condition.
• Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a condition that affects breathing and digestion due to
thick mucus building up in the body, especially the lungs and digestive system. In
CF, the mucus is thicker than normal and sticky.
• Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a metabolic disorder in which the individual cannot
metabolize phenylalanine, an amino acid. Left untreated intellectual deficits
occur. PKU is easily detected and is treated with a special diet.
• Tay Sachs Disease is caused by enzyme deficiency resulting in the accumulation
of lipids in the nerve cells of the brain. This accumulation results in progressive
damage to the cells and a decrease in cognitive and physical development. Death
typically occurs by age five.
•

Albinism is when the individual lacks melanin and possesses little to no pigment
in the skin, hair, and eyes. Vision problems can also occur.

Autosomal Dominant Disorders (Heterozygous): In order to have the disorder, the
individual only needs to inherit the gene change from one parent.
• Huntington’s Disease is a condition that affects the individual’s nervous system.
Nerve cells become damaged, causing various parts of the brain to deteriorate. The
disease affects movement, behavior and cognition. It is fatal, and occurs at
midlife.
• Tourette Syndrome is a tic disorder which results in uncontrollable motor and
vocal tics as well as body jerking.
• Achondroplasia is the most common form of disproportionate short stature. The
individual has abnormal bone growth resulting in short stature, disproportionately
short arms and legs, short fingers, a large head, and specific facial features.

Cases per Birth

Sex-Linked Disorders: When the X chromosome carries the mutated gene, the
disorder is referred to as an X-linked disorder. Males are more affected than females
because they possess only one X chromosome without an additional X chromosome to
counter the harmful gene.
• Fragile X Syndrome occurs when the body cannot make enough of a protein it
needs for the brain to grow and problems with learning and behavior can
occur. Fragile X syndrome is caused from an abnormality in the X chromosome,
which then breaks. If a female has fragile X, her second X chromosome usually is
healthy, but males with fragile X don’t have a second healthy X chromosome.
This is why symptoms of fragile X syndrome usually are more serious in males .
• Hemophilia occurs when there are problems in blood clotting causing both
internal and external bleeding.
• Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy is a weakening of the muscles resulting in an
inability to move, wasting away, and possible death.

Chromosomal Abnormalities
A chromosomal abnormality occurs when a child inherits too many or two few
chromosomes. The most common cause of chromosomal abnormalities is the age of the mother.
As the mother ages, the ovum is more likely to suffer abnormalities due to longer term exposure
to environmental factors. Consequently, some gametes do not divide evenly when they are
forming. Therefore, some cells have more than 46 chromosomes. In fact, it is believed that close
to half of all zygotes have an odd number of chromosomes. Most of these zygotes fail to develop
and are spontaneously aborted by the mother’s body.
One of the most common chromosomal abnormalities is on pair 21. Trisomy 21 or Down
syndrome occurs when there are three rather than two 21st chromosomes. A person with Down
syndrome typically exhibits an intellectual disability and possesses certain physical features,
such as short fingers and toes, folds of skin over the eyes, and a protruding tongue. There is as
much variation in people with Down syndrome as in most populations, and those differences
need to be recognized and appreciated. Refer to Table 2.2 on the prevalence of Down syndrome
in our home state of Illinois. Other less common chromosomal abnormalities of live-born infants
occur on chromosome 13 and chromosome 18.

on Maternal Age

When the abnormality is on 23rd pair the result is a sex-linked chromosomal abnormality. A
person might have XXY, XYY, XXX, XO. Two of the more common sex-linked chromosomal
disorders are Turner syndrome and Klinefelter syndrome. Turner syndrome occurs when part
or all of one of the X chromosomes is lost and the resulting zygote has an XO composition. This
occurs in 1 of every 2,500 live female births (Carroll, 2007) and affects the individual’s
cognitive functioning and sexual maturation. The external genitalia appear normal, but breasts
and ovaries do not develop fully and the woman does not menstruate. Turner syndrome also
results in short stature and other physical characteristics. Klinefelter syndrome (XXY) results
when an extra X chromosome is present in the cells of a male and occurs in 1 out of 650 live
male births. The Y chromosome stimulates the growth of male genitalia, but the additional X
chromosome inhibits this development. An individual with Klinefelter syndrome typically has
small testes, some breast development, infertility, and low levels of testosterone (National
Institutes of Health, 2019). See Table 2.3 for Chromosomal Disorders descriptions.
Table 2.3 Chromosomal Disorders
Autosomal Chromosome Disorders: The individual inherits too many or two few
chromosomes.
• Down Syndrome/Trisomy 21 is caused by an extra chromosome 21 and
includes a combination of birth defects. Affected individuals have some degree
of intellectual disability, characteristic facial features, often heart defects, and
other health problems. The severity varies greatly among affected individuals.
• Trisomy 13 is caused by an extra chromosome 13. Affected individuals have
multiple birth defects and generally die in the first weeks or months of life.
• Trisomy 18 is caused by an extra chromosome 18 and the affected individual
also has multiple birth defects and early death.

Cases per Birth

Sex-Linked Chromosomal Disorders: The disorder occurs on chromosome pair
#23 or the sex chromosomes.
• Turner Syndrome is caused when all or part of one of the X chromosomes is
lost before or soon after conception due to a random event. The resulting zygote
has an XO composition. Turner Syndrome affects cognitive functioning and
sexual maturation in girls. Infertility and a short stature may be noted.
• Klinefelter Syndrome is caused when an extra X chromosome is present in the
cells of a male due to a random event. The Y chromosome stimulates the growth
of male genitalia, but the additional X chromosome inhibits this development.
The male can have some breast development, infertility, and low levels of
testosterone.

Genetic Counseling: A service that assists individuals identify, test for, and explain potential
genetic conditions that could adversely affect themselves or their offspring is referred to as
genetic counseling (CDC, 2015b). The common reasons for genetic counseling include:
•
•
•

Family history of a genetic condition
Membership in a certain ethnic group with a higher risk of a genetic condition
Information regarding the results of genetic testing, including blood tests, amniocentesis,
or ultra sounds

Behavioral Genetics
Behavioral Genetics is the scientific study of the interplay between the genetic and
environmental contributions to behavior. Often referred to as the nature/nurture debate, Gottlieb
(1998, 2000, 2002) suggests an analytic framework for this debate that recognizes the interplay
between the environment, behavior, and genetic expression. This bidirectional interplay suggests
that the environment can affect the expression of genes just as genetic predispositions can impact
a person’s potentials. Additionally, environmental circumstances can trigger symptoms of a
genetic disorder. For example, a person who has sickle cell anemia, a recessive gene linked
disorder, can experience a sickle cell crisis under conditions of oxygen deprivation. Someone
predisposed genetically for type-two diabetes can trigger the disease through poor diet and little
exercise.
Research has shown how the environment and genotype interact in several ways. GenotypeEnvironment Correlations refer to the processes by which genetic factors contribute to
variations in the environment (Plomin, DeFries, Knopik, & Niederhiser, 2013). There are three
types of genotype-environment correlations:
Passive genotype-environment
Figure 2.3
correlation occurs when children
passively inherit the genes and the
environments their family provides.
Certain behavioral characteristics,
such as being athletically inclined,
may run in families. The children
have inherited both the genes that
would enable success at these
activities, and given the
environmental encouragement to
engage in these actions. Figure 2.3
highlights this correlation by
demonstrating how a family passes
on water skiing skills through both
genetics and environmental
opportunities.
Evocative genotype-environment correlation refers to how the social environment reacts to
individuals based on their inherited characteristics. For example, whether one has a more
outgoing or shy temperament will affect how he or she is treated by others.
Active genotype-environment correlation occurs when individuals seek out environments that
support their genetic tendencies. This is also referred to as niche picking. For example, children
who are musically inclined seek out music instruction and opportunities that facilitate their
natural musical ability.
41

Conversely, Genotype-Environment Interactions involve genetic susceptibility to the
environment. Adoption studies provide evidence for genotype-environment interactions. For
example, the Early Growth and Development Study (Leve, Neiderhiser, Scaramella, & Reiss,
2010) followed 360 adopted children and their adopted and biological parents in a longitudinal
study. Results have shown that children whose biological parents exhibited psychopathology,
exhibited significantly fewer behavior problems when their adoptive parents used more
structured parenting than unstructured. Additionally, elevated psychopathology in adoptive
parents increased the risk for the children’s development of behavior problems, but only when
the biological parents’ psychopathology was high. Consequently, the results show how
environmental effects on behavior differ based on the genotype, especially stressful
environments on genetically at-risk children.
Lastly, Epigenetics studies modifications in DNA that affect gene expression and are passed on
when the cells divide. Environmental factors, such as nutrition, stress, and teratogens are thought
to change gene expression by switching genes on and off. These gene changes can then be
inherited by daughter cells. This would explain why monozygotic or identical twins may
increasingly differ in gene expression with age. For example, Fraga et al. (2005) found that
when examining differences in DNA, a group of monozygotic twins were indistinguishable
during the early years. However, when the twins were older there were significant discrepancies
in their gene expression, most likely due to different experiences. These differences included
susceptibilities to disease and a range of personal characteristics.

Box 2.2 The Human Genome Project
In 1990 the Human Genome Project (HGP), an international scientific endeavor, began the task
of sequencing the 3 billion base pairs that make up the human genome. In April of 2003, more
than two years ahead of schedule, scientists gave us the genetic blueprint for building a human.
Since then, using the information from the HGP, researchers have discovered the genes
involved in over 1800 diseases. In 2005 the HGP amassed a large data base called HapMap
that catalogs the genetic variations in 11 global populations. Data on genetic variation can
improve our understanding of differential risk for disease and reactions to medical treatments,
such as drugs. Pharmacogenomic researchers have already developed tests to determine
whether a patient will respond favorably to certain drugs used in the treatment of breast cancer,
lung cancer or HIV by using information from HapMap (NIH, 2015).
Future directions for the HGP include identifying the genetic markers for all 50 major forms of
cancer (The Cancer Genome Atlas), continued use of the HapMap for creating more effective
drugs for the treatment of disease, and examining the legal, social and ethical implications of
genetic knowledge (NIH, 2015).
From the outset, the HGP made ethical issues one of their main concerns. Part of the HGP’s
budget supports research and holds workshops that address these concerns. Who owns this
information, and how the availability of genetic information may influence healthcare and its
impact on individuals, their families, and the greater community are just some of the many
questions being addressed (NIH, 2015).

Prenatal Development
Now we turn our attention to prenatal development which is divided into three periods: The
germinal period, the embryonic period, and the fetal period. The following is an overview of
some of the changes that take place during each period.

The Germinal Period
The germinal period (about 14 days in
length) lasts from conception to implantation
of the fertilized egg in the lining of the
uterus (See Figure 2.5). At ejaculation
millions of sperm are released into the
vagina, but only a few reach the egg and
typically only one fertilizes the egg. Once a
single sperm has entered the wall of the egg,
the wall becomes hard and prevents other
sperm from entering. After the sperm has
entered the egg, the tail of the sperm breaks
off and the head of the sperm, containing the
genetic information from the father, unites
with the nucleus of the egg. It is typically
fertilized in the top section of the fallopian
Sperm and Ovum at Conception
tube and continues its journey to the uterus.
As a result, a new cell is formed. This cell,
containing the combined genetic information from both parents, is referred to as a zygote.
Figure 2.4

During this time, the organism begins cell division through mitosis. After five days of mitosis
there are 100 cells, which is now called a blastocyst. The blastocyst consists of both an inner
and outer group of cells. The inner group of cells, or embryonic disk will become the embryo,
while the outer group of cells, or trophoblast, becomes the support system which nourishes the
developing organism. This stage ends when the blastocyst fully implants into the uterine wall
(U.S. National Library of Medicine, 2015a). Approximately 50-75% of blastocysts do not
implant in the uterine wall (Betts et al., 2019).
43

Mitosis is a fragile process and fewer than one half of all zygotes survive beyond the first two
weeks (Hall, 2004). Some of the reasons for this include the egg and sperm do not join properly,
thus their genetic material does not combine, there is too little or damaged genetic material, the
zygote does not replicate, or the blastocyst does not implant into the uterine wall. The failure rate
is higher for in vitro conceptions. Figure 2.5 illustrates the journey of the ova from its release to
its fertilization, cell duplication, and implantation into the uterine lining.

Figure 2.5 Germinal Period

The Embryonic Period
Starting the third week the blastocyst has implanted in the uterine wall. Upon implantation this
multi-cellular organism is called an embryo. Now blood vessels grow forming the placenta.
The placenta is a structure connected to the uterus that provides nourishment and oxygen from
the mother to the developing embryo via the umbilical cord. During this period, cells continue to
differentiate. Growth during prenatal development occurs in two major directions: from head to
tail called cephalocaudal development and from the midline outward referred to as
proximodistal development. This means that those structures nearest the head develop before
those nearest the feet and those structures nearest the torso develop before those away from the

44

center of the body (such as hands and
fingers). The head develops in the fourth
week and the precursor to the heart begins
to pulse. In the early stages of the
embryonic period, gills and a tail are
apparent. However, by the end of this stage
they disappear and the organism takes on a
more human appearance. Some organisms
fail during the embryonic period, usually
due to gross chromosomal abnormalities. As
in the case of the germinal period, often the
mother does not yet know that she is
pregnant. It is during this stage that the
major structures of the body are taking form
Photo by Lunar Caustic
making the embryonic period the time when
the organism is most vulnerable to the greatest amount of damage if exposed to harmful
substances. Potential mothers are not often aware of the risks they introduce to the developing
embryo during this time. The embryo is approximately 1 inch in length and weighs about 8
grams at the end of eight weeks (Betts et al., 2019). The embryo can move and respond to touch
at this time.
Figure 2.6 The Embryo

The Fetal Period
From the ninth week until birth, the organism is referred to as a fetus. During this stage, the
major structures are continuing to develop. By the third month, the fetus has all its body parts
including external genitalia. In the following weeks, the fetus will develop hair, nails, teeth and
the excretory and digestive systems will continue to develop. The fetus is about 3 inches long
and weighs about 28 grams.
During the 4th - 6th months, the eyes become more sensitive to light and hearing develops. The
respiratory system continues to develop, and reflexes such as sucking, swallowing and
hiccupping, develop during the 5th month. Cycles of sleep and wakefulness are present at this
time as well. The first chance of survival outside the womb, known as the age of viability is
reached at about 24 weeks (Morgan, Goldenberg, & Schulkin, 2008). Many practitioners hesitate
to resuscitate before 24 weeks. The majority of the neurons in the brain have developed by 24
weeks, although they are still rudimentary, and the glial or nurse cells that support neurons
continue to grow. At 24 weeks the fetus can feel pain (Royal College of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists, 1997).

45

Figure 2.7 Fetus

Between the 7th - 9th months, the fetus is primarily
preparing for birth. It is exercising its muscles and its
lungs begin to expand and contract. The fetus gains
about 5 pounds and 7 inches during this last trimester
of pregnancy, and during the 8th month a layer of fat
develops under the skin. This layer of fat serves as
insulation and helps the baby regulate body
temperature after birth.
At around 36 weeks the fetus is almost ready for birth.
It weighs about 6 pounds and is about 18.5 inches
long. By week 37 all of the fetus’s organ systems are
developed enough that it could survive outside the
mother’s uterus without many of the risks associated
with premature birth. The fetus continues to gain
weight and grow in length until approximately 40
weeks. By then the fetus has very little room to move
around and birth becomes imminent. The progression
through the stages is shown in Figure 2.8.

Prenatal Brain Development
Prenatal brain development begins in the third gestational week with the differentiation of stem
cells, which are capable of producing all the different cells that make up the brain (Stiles &
Jernigan, 2010). The location of these stem cells in the embryo is referred to as the neural
plate. By the end of the third week, two ridges appear along the neural plate first forming the
neural groove and then the neural tube. The open region in the center of the neural tube forms
the brain’s ventricles and spinal canal. By the end of the embryonic period, or week eight, the
neural tube has further differentiated into the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain.
Brain development during the fetal period involves neuron production, migration, and
differentiation. From the early fetal period until midgestation, most of the 85 billion neurons
have been generated and many have already migrated to their brain positions. Neurogenesis, or
the formation of neurons, is largely completed after five months of gestation. One exception is
in the hippocampus, which continues to develop neurons throughout life. Neurons that form the
neocortex, or the layer of cells that lie on the surface of the brain, migrate to their location in an
orderly way. Neural migration is mostly completed in the cerebral cortex by 24 weeks (Poduri &
Volpe, 2018). Once in position, neurons begin to produce dendrites and axons that begin to form
the neural networks responsible for information processing. Regions of the brain that contain
the cell bodies are referred to as the gray matter because they look gray in appearance. The
axons that form the neural pathways make up the white matter because they are covered in
myelin, a fatty substance that is white in appearance. Myelin aids in both the insulation and
efficiency of neural transmission. Although cell differentiation is complete at birth, the growth
of dendrites, axons, and synapses continue for years.

Teratogens
Good prenatal care is essential. The developing child is most at risk for some of the severe
problems during the first three months of development. Unfortunately, this is a time at which
many mothers are unaware that they are pregnant. Today, we know many of the factors that can
jeopardize the health of the developing child. The study of factors that contribute to birth defects
is called teratology. Teratogens are environmental factors that can contribute to birth defects,
and include some maternal diseases, pollutants, drugs and alcohol.
Factors influencing prenatal risks: There are several considerations in determining the type
and amount of damage that might result from exposure to a particular teratogen (Berger,
2005). These include:
•

•

The timing of the exposure: Structures in the body are vulnerable to the most severe
damage when they are forming. If a substance is introduced during a particular structure's
critical period (time of development), the damage to that structure may be greater. For
example, the ears and arms reach their critical periods at about 6 weeks after conception.
If a mother exposes the embryo to certain substances during this period, the arms and ears
may be malformed.
The amount of exposure: Some substances are not harmful unless the amounts reach a
certain level. The critical level depends in part on the size and metabolism of the mother.
47

•

•

The number of teratogens: Fetuses exposed to multiple teratogens typically have more
problems than those exposed to only one.
Genetics: Genetic make-up also plays a role on the impact a particular teratogen might
have on the child. This is suggested by fraternal twins exposed to the same prenatal
environment, but they do not experience the same teratogenic effects. The genetic makeup of the mother can also have an effect; some mothers may be more resistant to
teratogenic effects than others.
Being male or female: Males are more likely to experience damage due to teratogens
than are females. It is believed that the Y chromosome, which contains fewer genes than
the X, may have an impact.

Figure 2.9 illustrates the timing of teratogen exposure and the types of structural defects that can
occur during the prenatal period.

Figure 2.9 Critical Periods of Prenatal Development

Alcohol: One of the most commonly used teratogens is alcohol, and because half of all
pregnancies in the United States are unplanned, it is recommended that women of child-bearing
age take great caution against drinking alcohol when not using birth control or when pregnant
(CDC, 2005). Alcohol use during pregnancy is the leading preventable cause of intellectual
disabilities in children in the United States (Maier & West, 2001). Alcohol consumption,
particularly during the second month of prenatal development but at any point during pregnancy,
may lead to neurocognitive and behavioral difficulties that can last a lifetime.
48

In extreme cases, alcohol consumption during pregnancy can lead to fetal death, but also can
result in Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD), which is an umbrella term for the range
of effects that can occur due to alcohol consumption during pregnancy (March of Dimes, 2016a).
The most severe form of FASD is Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS). Children with FAS share
certain physical features such as flattened noses, small eye holes, and small heads (see Figure
2.10). Cognitively, these children have poor judgment, poor impulse control, higher rates of
ADHD, learning issues, and lower IQ scores. These developmental problems and delays persist
into adulthood (Streissguth, Barr, Kogan, & Bookstein, 1996) and can include criminal behavior,
psychiatric problems, and unemployment (CDC, 2016a). Based on animal studies, it has been
hypothesized that a mother’s alcohol consumption during pregnancy may predispose her child to
like alcohol (Youngentob, Molina, Spear, & Youngentob, 2007). Binge drinking, or 4 or more
drinks in 2 to 3 hours, during pregnancy increases the chance of having a baby with FASD
(March of Dimes, 2016a).

Tobacco: Another widely used teratogen is tobacco as more than 7% of pregnant women
smoked in 2016 (Someji & Beltrán-Sánchez, 2019). According to Tong et al. (2013) in
conjunction with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, data from 27 sites in 2010
representing 52% of live births, showed that among women with recent live births:
• About 23% reported smoking in the 3 months prior to pregnancy.
• Almost 11% reported smoking during pregnancy.
• More than half (54.3%) reported that they quit smoking by the last 3 months of
pregnancy.
• Almost 16% reported smoking after delivery.
When comparing the ages of women who smoked:
• Women <20, 13.6% smoked during pregnancy
• Women 20–24 ,17.6% smoked during pregnancy
• Women 25–34 , 8.8% smoked during pregnancy
• Women ≥35, 5.7% smoked during pregnancy
49

The findings among racial and ethnic groups indicated that smoking during pregnancy was
highest among American Indians/Alaska Natives (26.0%) and lowest among Asians/Pacific
Islanders (2.1%).
When a pregnant woman smokes the fetus is exposed to dangerous chemicals including nicotine,
carbon monoxide and tar, which lessen the amount of oxygen available to the fetus. Oxygen is
important for overall growth and development. Tobacco use during pregnancy has been
associated with low birth weight, ecotopic pregnancy (fertilized egg implants itself outside of
the uterus), placenta previa (placenta lies low in the uterus and covers all or part of the cervix),
placenta abruption (placenta separates prematurely from the uterine wall), preterm delivery,
stillbirth, fetal growth restriction, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), birth defects, learning
disabilities, and early puberty in girls (Center for Disease Control, 2015d).
A woman being exposed to secondhand smoke during pregnancy has also been linked to lowbirth weight infants. In addition, exposure to thirdhand smoke, or toxins from tobacco smoke
that linger on clothing, furniture, and in locations where smoking has occurred, results in a
negative impact on infants’ lung development. Rehan, Sakurai, and Torday (2011) found that
prenatal exposure to thirdhand smoke played a greater role in altered lung functioning in children
than exposure postnatally.
Prescription/Over-the-counter Drugs: About 70% of pregnant women take at least one
prescription drug (March of Dimes, 2016e). A woman should not be taking any prescription drug
during pregnancy unless it was prescribed by a health care provider who knows she is pregnant.
Some prescription drugs can cause birth defects, problems in overall health, and development of
the fetus. Over-the-counter drugs are also a concern during the prenatal period because they may
cause certain health problems. For example, the pain reliever ibuprofen can cause serious blood
flow problems to the fetus during the last three months.

Illicit Drugs: Common illicit drugs include
cocaine, ecstasy and other club drugs,
heroin, marijuana, and prescription drugs
that are abused. It is difficult to completely
determine the effects of a particular illicit
drug on a developing child because most
mothers who use, use more than one
substance and have other unhealthy
behaviors. These include smoking, drinking
alcohol, not eating healthy meals, and being
more likely to get a sexually transmitted
disease. However, several problems seem
clear. The use of cocaine is connected with
low birth weight, stillbirths and spontaneous
Source
abortion. Heavy marijuana use is associated
with problems in brain development (March
of Dimes, 2016c). If a baby’s mother used an addictive drug during pregnancy that baby can
Figure 2.11

50

get addicted to the drug before birth and go through drug withdrawal after birth, also known as
Neonatal abstinence syndrome (March of Dimes, 2015d). Other complications of illicit drug
use include premature birth, smaller than normal head size, birth defects, heart defects, and
infections. Additionally, babies born to mothers who use drugs may have problems later in life,
including learning and behavior difficulties, slower than normal growth, and die from sudden
infant death syndrome. Children of substance abusing parents are also considered at high risk for
a range of biological, developmental, academic, and behavioral problems, including developing
substance abuse problems of their own (Conners, et al., 2003).
Box 2.3 Should Women Who Use Drugs During Pregnancy Be Arrested and Jailed?
Women who use drugs or alcohol during pregnancy can cause serious lifelong harm
to their child. Some people have advocated mandatory screenings for women who
are pregnant and have a history of drug abuse, and if the women continue using, to
arrest, prosecute, and incarcerate them (Figdor & Kaeser, 1998). This policy was
tried in Charleston, South Carolina 20 years ago. The policy was called the
Interagency Policy on Management of Substance Abuse During Pregnancy and had
disastrous results:
The Interagency Policy applied to patients attending the obstetrics clinic
at MUSC, which primarily serves patients who are indigent or on
Medicaid. It did not apply to private obstetrical patients. The policy
required patient education about the harmful effects of substance abuse
during pregnancy. A statement also warned patients that protection of
unborn and newborn children from the harms of illegal drug abuse could
involve the Charleston police, the Solicitor of the Ninth Judicial Court,
and the Protective Services Division of the Department of Social Services
(DSS). (Jos, Marshall, & Perlmutter, 1995, pp. 120–121)
This policy seemed to deter women from seeking prenatal care, deterred them
from seeking other social services, and was applied solely to low-income women,
resulting in lawsuits. The program was canceled after 5 years, during which 42
women were arrested. A federal agency later determined that the program involved
human experimentation without the approval and oversight of an institutional
review board (IRB).
In July 2014, Tennessee enacted a law that allows women who illegally use a
narcotic drug while pregnant to be prosecuted for assault if her infant is harmed or
addicted to the drug (National Public Radio, 2015). According to the National
Public Radio report, a baby is born dependent on a drug every 30 minutes in
Tennessee, which is a rate three times higher than the national average. However,
since the law took effect the number of babies born having drug withdrawal
symptoms has not diminished. Critics contend that the criminal justice system
should not be involved in what is considered a healthcare problem. What do you
think? Is the issue of mothers using illicit drugs more of a legal or medical
concern?

51

Pollutants: There are more than 83,000 chemicals used in the United States with little
information on the effects of them during pregnancy (March of Dimes, 2016b).
• Lead: An environmental pollutant of significant concern is lead poisoning, which has
been linked to fertility problems, high blood pressure, low birth weight, prematurity,
miscarriage, and slowed neurological development. Grossman and Slutsky (2017) found
that babies born in Flint Michigan, an area identified with high lead levels in the drinking
water, were premature, weighed less than average, and gained less weight than expected.
• Pesticides: The chemicals in certain pesticides are also potentially damaging and may
lead to birth defects, learning problems, low birth weight, miscarriage, and premature
birth (March of Dimes, 2014).
• Bisphenol A: Prenatal exposure to bisphenol A (BPA), a chemical commonly used in
plastics and food and beverage containers, may disrupt the action of certain genes
contributing to certain birth defects (March of Dimes, 2016b).
• Radiation: If a mother is exposed to radiation, it can get into the bloodstream and pass
through the umbilical cord to the baby. Radiation can also build up in body areas close to
the uterus, such as the bladder. Exposure to radiation can slow the baby’s growth, cause
birth defects, affect brain development, cause cancer, and result in a miscarriage.
• Mercury: Mecury, a heavy metal, can cause brain damage and affect the baby’s hearing
and vision. This is why women are cautioned about the amount and type of fish they
consume during pregnancy.
Toxoplasmosis: The tiny parasite, toxoplasma gondii,
Figure 2.12
causes an infection called toxoplasmosis. According
to the March of Dimes (2012d), toxoplasma gondii
infects more than 60 million people in the United
States. A healthy immune system can keep the
parasite at bay producing no symptoms, so most
people do not know they are infected. As a routine
prenatal screening frequently does not test for the
presence of this parasite, pregnant women may want to
talk to their health-care provider about being tested.
Toxoplasmosis can cause premature birth, stillbirth,
and can result in birth defects to the eyes and brain.
Source
While most babies born with this infection show no
symptoms, ten percent may experience eye infections,
enlarged liver and spleen, jaundice, and pneumonia. To avoid being infected, women should
avoid eating undercooked or raw meat and unwashed fruits and vegetables, touching cooking
utensils that touched raw meat or unwashed fruits and vegetables, and touching cat feces, soil or
sand. If women think they may have been infected during pregnancy, they should have their
baby tested.
Sexually Transmitted Diseases: Gonorrhea, syphilis, and chlamydia are sexually transmitted
infections that can be passed to the fetus by an infected mother. Mothers should be tested as early
as possible to minimize the risk of spreading these infections to their unborn child. Additionally,
the earlier the treatment begins, the better the health outcomes for mother and baby (CDC,
2016d). Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) can cause premature birth, premature rupture of
52

the amniotic sac, an ectopic pregnancy, birth defects, miscarriage, and still births (March of
Dimes, 2013). Most babies become infected with STDS while passing through the birth canal
during delivery, but some STDs can cross the placenta and infect the developing fetus.
Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV): One of the most potentially devastating teratogens is
HIV. HIV and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) are leading causes of illness and
death in the United States (Health Resources and Services Administration, 2015). One of the
main ways children under age 13 become infected with HIV is via mother-to-child transmission
of the virus prenatally, during labor, or by breastfeeding (CDC, 2016c). There are some
measures that can be taken to lower the chance the child will contract the disease. HIV positive
mothers who take antiviral medications during their pregnancy greatly reduce the chance of
passing the virus to the fetus. The risk of transmission is less than 2 percent; in contrast, it is 25
percent if the mother does not take antiretroviral drugs (CDC, 2016b). However, the long-term
risks of prenatal exposure to the medication are not known. It is recommended that women with
HIV deliver the child by c-section, and that after birth they avoid breast feeding.
German measles (or rubella): Rubella, also called German measles, is an infection that causes
mild flu-like symptoms and a rash on the skin. However, only about half of children infected
have these symptoms, while others have no symptoms (March of Dimes, 2012a). Rubella has
been associated with a number of birth defects. If the mother contracts the disease during the first
three months of pregnancy, damage can occur in the eyes, ears, heart or brain of the unborn
child. Deafness is almost certain if the mother has German measles before the 11th week of
prenatal development and can also cause brain damage. Women in the United States are much
less likely to be afflicted with rubella, because most women received childhood vaccinations that
protect her from the disease.

Maternal Factors
Mothers over 35: Most women over 35 who become pregnant are in good health and have
healthy pregnancies. However, according to the March of Dimes (2016d), women over age 35
are more likely to have an increased risk of:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Fertility problems
High blood pressure
Diabetes
Miscarriages
Placenta Previa
Cesarean section
Premature birth
Stillbirth
A baby with a genetic disorder or other birth defects

Because a woman is born with all her eggs, environmental teratogens can affect the quality of the
eggs as women get older. Also, a woman’s reproductive system ages which can adversely affect
the pregnancy. Some women over 35 choose special prenatal screening tests, such as a maternal
blood screening, to determine if there are any health risks for the baby.
53

Although there are medical concerns associated
with having a child later in life, there are also
many positive consequences to being a more
mature parent. Older parents are more confident,
less stressed, and typically married providing
family stability. Their children perform better on
math and reading tests, and they are less prone to
injuries or emotional troubles (Albert, 2013).
Women who choose to wait are often well
educated and lead healthy lives. According to
Gregory (2007), older women are more stable,
demonstrate a stronger family focus, possess
Source
greater self-confidence, and have more money.
Having a child later in one’s career equals overall higher wages. In fact, for every year a woman
delays motherhood, she makes 9% more in lifetime earnings. Lastly, women who delay having
children actually live longer. Sun et al. (2015) found that women who had their last child after
the age of 33 doubled their chances of living to age 95 or older than women who had their last
child before their 30th birthday. A woman’s natural ability to have a child at a later age indicates
that her reproductive system is aging slowly, and consequently so is the rest of her body.
Figure 2.13

Teenage Pregnancy: A teenage mother is at a greater risk for having pregnancy complications
including anemia, and high blood pressure. These risks are even greater for those under age 15.
Infants born to teenage mothers have a higher risk for being premature and having low
birthweight or other serious health problems. Premature and low birthweight babies may have
organs that are not fully developed which can result in breathing problems, bleeding in the brain,
vision loss, and serious intestinal problems. Very low birthweight babies (less than 3 1/3
pounds) are more than 100 times as likely to die, and moderately low birthweight babies
(between 3 1/3 and 5 ½ pounds) are more than 5 times as likely to die in their first year, than
normal weight babies (March of Dimes, 2012c). Again, the risk is highest for babies of mothers
under age 15. Reasons for these health issues include that teenagers are the least likely of all age
groups to get early and regular prenatal care. Additionally, they may engage in negative
behaviors including eating unhealthy food, smoking, drinking alcohol, and taking drugs.
Additional concerns for teenagers are repeat births. About 25% of teen mothers under age 18
have a second baby within 2 years after the first baby’s birth.
Gestational Diabetes: Seven percent of pregnant women develop gestational diabetes (March
of Dimes, 2015b). Diabetes is a condition where the body has too much glucose in the
bloodstream. Most pregnant women have their glucose level tested at 24 to 28 weeks of
pregnancy. Gestational diabetes usually goes away after the mother gives birth, but it might
indicate a risk for developing diabetes later in life. If untreated, gestational diabetes can cause
premature birth, stillbirth, the baby having breathing problems at birth, jaundice, or low blood
sugar. Babies born to mothers with gestational diabetes can also be considerably heavier (more
than 9 pounds) making the labor and birth process more difficult. For expectant mothers,
untreated gestational diabetes can cause preeclampsia (high blood pressure and signs that the
liver and kidneys may not be working properly) discussed later in the chapter. Risk factors for
gestational diabetes include age (being over age 25), being overweight or gaining too much
54

weight during pregnancy, family history of diabetes, having had gestational diabetes with a prior
pregnancy, and race and ethnicity (African-American, Native American, Hispanic, Asian, or
Pacific Islander have a higher risk). Eating healthy and maintaining a healthy weight during
pregnancy can reduce the chance of gestational diabetes. Women who already have diabetes and
become pregnant need to attend all their prenatal care visits, and follow the same advice as those
for women with gestational diabetes as the risk of preeclampsia, premature birth, birth defects,
and stillbirth are the same.
High Blood Pressure (Hypertension): Hypertension is a condition in which the pressure
against the wall of the arteries becomes too high. There are two types of high blood pressure
during pregnancy, gestational and chronic. Gestational hypertension only occurs during
pregnancy and goes away after birth. Chronic high blood pressure refers to women who already
had hypertension before the pregnancy or to those who developed it during pregnancy and it
continued after birth. According to the March of Dimes (2015c) about 8 in every 100 pregnant
women have high blood pressure. High blood pressure during pregnancy can cause premature
birth and low birth weight (under five and a half pounds), placental abruption, and mothers can
develop preeclampsia.
Rh Disease: Rh is a protein found in the blood. Most people are Rh positive, meaning they have
this protein. Some people are Rh negative, meaning this protein is absent. Mothers who are Rh
negative are at risk of having a baby with a form of anemia called Rh disease (March of Dimes,
2009). A father who is Rh-positive and mother who is Rh-negative can conceive a baby who is
Rh-positive. Some of the fetus’s blood cells may get into the mother’s bloodstream and her
immune system is unable to recognize the Rh factor. The immune system starts to produce
antibodies to fight off what it thinks is a foreign invader. Once her body produces immunity, the
antibodies can cross the placenta and start to destroy the red blood cells of the developing fetus.
As this process takes time, often the first Rh positive baby is not harmed, but as the mother’s
body will continue to produce antibodies to the Rh factor across her lifetime, subsequent
pregnancies can pose greater risk for an Rh positive baby. In the newborn, Rh disease can lead
to jaundice, anemia, heart failure, brain damage and death.
Weight Gain during Pregnancy: According to March of Dimes (2016f) during pregnancy most
women need only an additional 300 calories per day to aid in the growth of the fetus. Gaining
too little or too much weight during pregnancy can be harmful. Women who gain too little may

have a baby who is low-birth weight, while those who gain too much are likely to have a
premature or large baby. There is also a greater risk for the mother developing preeclampsia and
diabetes, which can cause further problems during the pregnancy. Table 2.4 shows the healthy
weight gain during pregnancy. Putting on the weight slowly is best. Mothers who are concerned
about their weight gain should talk to their health care provider.
Stress: Feeling stressed is common during pregnancy, but high levels of stress can cause
complications including having a premature baby or a low-birthweight baby. Babies born early
or too small are at an increased risk for health problems. Stress-related hormones may cause
these complications by affecting a woman’s immune systems resulting in an infection and
premature birth. Additionally, some women deal with stress by smoking, drinking alcohol, or
taking drugs, which can lead to problems in the pregnancy. High levels of stress in pregnancy
have also been correlated with problems in the baby’s brain development and immune system
functioning, as well as childhood problems such as trouble paying attention and being afraid
(March of Dimes, 2012b).
Depression: Depression is a significant medical condition in which feelings of sadness,
worthlessness, guilt, and fatigue interfere with one’s daily functioning. Depression can occur
before, during, or after pregnancy, and 1 in 7 women is treated for depression sometime between
the year before pregnancy and year after pregnancy (March of Dimes, 2015a). Women who
have experienced depression previously are more likely to have depression during pregnancy.
Consequences of depression include the baby being born premature, having a low birthweight,
being more irritable, less active, less attentive, and having fewer facial expressions. About 13%
of pregnant women take an antidepressant during pregnancy. It is important that women taking
antidepressants during pregnancy discuss the medication with a health care provider as some
medications can cause harm to the developing organism. In fact, birth defects happen about 2 to
3 times more often in women who are prescribed certain Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors
(SSRIs) for their depression.
Paternal Impact: The age of fathers at the time of
conception is also an important factor in health risks
for children. According to Nippoldt (2015) offspring
of men over 40 face an increased risk of miscarriages,
autism, birth defects, achondroplasia (bone growth
disorder) and schizophrenia. These increased health
risks are thought to be due to accumulated
chromosomal aberrations and mutations during the
maturation of sperm cells in older men (Bray,
Gunnell, & Smith, 2006). However, like older women,
the overall risks are small.

Figure 2.14 Hazardous Occupations

Source

In addition, men are more likely than women to work
in occupations where hazardous chemicals, many of which have teratogenic effects or may cause
genetic mutations, are used (Cordier, 2008). These may include petrochemicals, lead, and
pesticides that can cause abnormal sperm and lead to miscarriages or diseases. Men are also
more likely to be a source of secondhand smoke for their developing offspring. As noted earlier,
smoking by either the mother or around the mother can hinder prenatal development.
56

Prenatal Assessment
A number of assessments are suggested to women as part of their routine prenatal care to find
conditions that may increase the risk of complications for the mother and fetus (Eisenberg,
Murkoff, & Hathaway, 1996). These can include blood and urine analyses and screening and
diagnostic tests for birth defects.
Ultrasound is one of the main screening tests
Figure 2.15 Preparing for an Ultrasound
done in combination with blood tests. The
ultrasound is a test in which sound waves are
used to examine the fetus. There are two general
types. Transvaginal ultrasounds are used in
early pregnancy, while transabdominal
ultrasounds are more common and used after 10
weeks of pregnancy (typically, 16 to 20 weeks).
Ultrasounds are used to check the fetus for
defects or problems. It can also find out the age
of the fetus, location of the placenta, fetal
position, movement, breathing and heart rate,
amount of amniotic fluid, and number of fetuses.
Most women have at least one ultra sound
during pregnancy, but if problems are noted,
Source
additional ultrasounds may be recommended.
When diagnosis of a birth defect
is necessary, ultrasounds help
guide the more invasive
diagnostic tests of amniocentesis
and chorionic villus sampling.
Amniocentesis is a procedure in
which a needle is used to
withdraw a small amount of
amniotic fluid and cells from the
sac surrounding the fetus and
later tested (see Figure 2.16).

Figure 2.16 Amniocentesis

Chorionic Villus Sampling is a
procedure in which a small
sample of cells is taken from the
placenta and tested. Both
amniocentesis and chorionic
villus sampling have a risk of
miscarriage, and consequently
they are not done routinely.

Box 2.4 Infertility and Reproductive Technology
Infertility: Infertility affects about 10 to 15 percent of couples in the United States (Mayo
Clinic, 2015). For men, the most common cause is a lack of, or low sperm production, and for
women, it is the failure to ovulate. Another common cause for women is pelvic inflammatory
disease (PID), which is an infection of a woman’s reproductive organs (Carroll, 2007). It is
often a complication caused by and STD, such as chlamydia and gonorrhea, although other
infections that are not sexually transmitted can also cause PID.
Fertility treatment: The majority of infertility cases are treated using fertility drugs to
increase ovulation, or with surgical procedures to repair the reproductive organs or remove
scar tissue from the reproductive tract. In in vitro fertilization (IVF) eggs are removed from
the female and are fertilized outside the woman’s body. The fertilized egg is then reinserted in
the woman’s uterus. The success rate varies depending on the type of egg implanted, such as
whether the egg was recently removed from the woman, used after being frozen, or donated
from another woman. Success is also highly dependent on the age of the mother (See Figure
2.17).
Figure 2.17 Percentage of Pregnancies, Live Births, and Single-Infant Live Births
from IVF from Fresh Non-Donor Eggs

Source

Higher success rates, but less common procedures include gamete intra-fallopian tube
transfer (GIFT) which involves implanting both sperm and ova into the fallopian tube and
fertilization is allowed to occur naturally (Carroll, 2007). Zygote intra-fallopian tube
transfer (ZIFT) is another procedure in which sperm and ova are fertilized outside of the
woman’s body and the fertilized egg is then implanted in the fallopian tube. This allows the
zygote to travel down the fallopian tube and embed in the lining of the uterus naturally. This
procedure also has a higher success rate than IVF.
58

Complications of Pregnancy
Minor complications: There are a number of common side effects of pregnancy. Not everyone
experiences all of these, nor to the same degree. And although they are considered "minor" this is
not to say that these problems are not potentially very uncomfortable. These side effects include
nausea (particularly during the first 3-4 months of pregnancy as a result of higher levels of
estrogen in the system), heartburn, gas, hemorrhoids, backache, leg cramps, insomnia,
constipation, shortness of breath or varicose veins (as a result of carrying a heavy load on the
abdomen).
Major Complications: The following are some serious complications of pregnancy which can
pose health risks to mother and child and that often require hospitalization.
Ectopic Pregnancy occurs when the zygote becomes attached to the fallopian tube before
reaching the uterus. About 1 in 50 pregnancies in the United States are tubal pregnancies and
this number has been increasing because of the higher rates of pelvic inflammatory disease and
Chlamydia (Carroll, 2007). Abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, nausea and fainting are symptoms
of ectopic pregnancy.
Preeclampsia, also known as Toxemia, is characterized by a sharp rise in blood pressure, a
leakage of protein into the urine as a result of kidney problems, and swelling of the hands, feet,
and face during the third trimester of pregnancy. Preeclampsia is the most common complication
of pregnancy. It is estimated to affect 5% to 10% of all pregnancies globally and accounts for
40% to 60% of maternal deaths in developing countries (National Institute of Child Health and
Human Development, 2013). Rates are lower in the United States and preeclampsia affects
about 3% to 5% of pregnant women.
Preeclampsia occurs most frequently in first pregnancies, and it is more common in women who
are obese, have diabetes, or are carrying twins. When preeclampsia causes seizures, the
condition is known as eclampsia, which is the second leading cause of maternal death in the
United States. Preeclampsia is also a leading cause of fetal complications, which include low
birth weight, premature birth, and stillbirth. Treatment is typically bed rest and sometimes
medication. If this treatment is ineffective, labor may be induced.
Maternal Mortality: Acording to the CDC (2019), about 700 American women die from
complications related to pregnancy each year, and this number is rising. Further, 60% of those
deaths could have been prevented. Bleeding, infections, and heart-related problems are the main
causes. Possible contributing factors include the high caesarean section rate and obesity.
Compared to other developed nations, this number is considered high. Approximately 1000
women die in childbirth around the world each day (World Health Organization, 2010). Rates
are highest in Subsaharan Africa and South Asia, although there has been a substantial decrease
in these rates. The campaign to make childbirth safe for everyone has led to the development of
clinics accessible to those living in more isolated areas and training more midwives to assist in
childbirth.

59

Spontaneous abortion is experienced in an estimated 20-40 percent of undiagnosed pregnancies
and in another 10 percent of diagnosed pregnancies. Usually the body aborts due to
chromosomal abnormalities, and this typically happens before the 12th week of
pregnancy. Cramping and bleeding result and normal periods return after several months. Some
women are more likely to have repeated miscarriages due to chromosomal, amniotic, or
hormonal problems, but miscarriage can also be a result of defective sperm (Carrell et. al.,
2003).

Preparation for Childbirth
Prepared childbirth refers to being not only in good physical condition to help provide a healthy
environment for the baby to develop, but also helping individuals to prepare to accept their new
roles as parents. Additionally, parents can receive information and training that will assist them
for delivery and life with the baby. The more future parents can learn about childbirth and the
newborn, the better prepared they will be for the adjustment they must make to a new life.
One of the most common methods for preparing for childbirth is The Lamaze Method. This
method originated in Russia and was brought to the United States in the 1950s by Fernand
Lamaze. The emphasis of this method is on teaching the woman to be in control in the process of
delivery. It includes learning muscle relaxation, breathing though contractions, having a focal
point (usually a picture to look at) during contractions and having a support person who goes
through the training process with the mother and serves as a coach during delivery (Eisenberg,
Murkoff, & Hathaway, 1996).
Choosing Where to Have the Baby and Who Will Deliver: The vast majority of births occur
in a hospital setting. However, one percent of women choose to deliver at home (Martin,
Hamilton, Osterman, Curtin, & Mathews, 2015). Women who are at low risk for birth
complications can successfully deliver at home. More than half (67%) of home deliveries are by
certified nurse midwifes. Midwives are trained and licensed to assist in delivery and are far less
expensive than the cost of a hospital delivery. However, because of the potential for a
complication during the birth process, most medical professionals recommend that delivery take
place in a hospital. Despite the concerns, in the United States women who have had previous
children, who are over 25, and who are white are more likely to have out-of-hospital births
(MacDorman, Menacker, & Declercq, 2010). In addition to home births, one-third of out-of-

60

hospital births occur in freestanding clinics, birthing centers, in physician’s offices, or other
locations.

Stages of Birth for Vaginal Delivery
Figure 2.17 Stages of Birth for a Vaginal Delivery

Source

The First Stage of labor begins with
uterine contractions that may initially
last about 30 seconds and be spaced
15 to 20 minutes apart. These increase
in duration and frequency to more than
a minute in length and about 3 to 4
minutes apart. Typically, doctors
advise that they be called when
contractions are coming about every 5
minutes. Some women experience
false labor or Braxton-Hicks
contractions, especially with the first
child. These may come and go. They
tend to diminish when the mother
begins walking around. Real labor
pains tend to increase with
walking. Labor may also be signaled
by a bloody discharge being expelled
from the cervix. In one out of 8
pregnancies, the amniotic sac or water
in which the fetus is suspended may
break before labor begins. In such
cases, the physician may induce labor
with the use of medication if it does
not begin on its own in order to reduce
the risk of infection. Normally this
sac does not rupture until the later
stages of labor.

The first stage of labor is typically the longest. During this stage the cervix or opening to the
uterus dilates to 10 centimeters or just under 4 inches (See Figure 2.17). This may take around
12-16 hours for first children or about 6-9 hours for women who have previously given birth.
Labor may also begin with a discharge of blood or amniotic fluid.
The Second Stage involves the passage of the baby through the birth canal. This stage takes
about 10-40 minutes. Contractions usually come about every 2-3 minutes. The mother pushes
and relaxes as directed by the medical staff. Normally the head is delivered first. The baby is
then rotated so that one shoulder can come through and then the other shoulder. The rest of the
baby quickly passes through. At this stage, an episiotomy or incision made in the tissue
between the vaginal opening and anus, may be performed to avoid tearing the tissue of the back
61

of the vaginal opening (Mayo Clinic, 2016). The baby's mouth and nose are suctioned out. The
umbilical cord is clamped and cut.
The Third Stage is relatively painless. During this stage, the placenta or afterbirth is delivered.
This is typically within 20 minutes after delivery. If an episiotomy was performed it is stitched
up during this stage.
More than 50% of women giving birth at hospitals use an epidural anesthesia during
delivery (American Pregnancy Association, 2015). An epidural block is a regional
analgesic that can be used during labor and alleviates most pain in the lower body without
slowing labor. The epidural block can be used throughout labor and has little to no effect on the
baby. Medication is injected into a small space outside the spinal cord in the lower back. It takes
10 to 20 minutes for the medication to take effect. An epidural block with stronger medications,
such as anesthetics, can be used shortly before a C-section or if a vaginal birth requires the use of
forceps or vacuum extraction.
A Cesarean section (C-section) is surgery to deliver the baby by being removed through the
mother's abdomen. In the United States, about one in three women have their babies delivered
this way (Martin et al., 2015). Most C-sections are done when problems occur during delivery
unexpectedly. These can include:
• Health problems in the mother
• Signs of distress in the baby
• Not enough room for the baby to go through the vagina
• The position of the baby, such as a breech presentation where the head is not in the
downward position
C-sections are also more common among women carrying more than one baby. Although the
surgery is relatively safe for mother and baby, it is considered major surgery and carries health
risks. Additionally, it also takes longer to recover from a C-section than from vaginal birth. After
healing, the incision may leave a weak spot in the wall of the uterus. This could cause problems
with an attempted vaginal birth later. However, more than half of women who have a C-section
can have a vaginal birth later.
Induced birth: Sometimes a baby’s arrival may need to be induced or delivered before labor
begins. Inducing labor may be recommended for a variety of reasons when there is concern for
the health of the mother or baby. For example:
• The mother is approaching two weeks beyond her due date and labor has not started
naturally
• The mother’s water has broken, but contractions have not begun
• There is an infection in the mother’s uterus
• The baby has stopped growing at the expected pace
• There is not enough amniotic fluid surrounding the baby
• The placenta peels away, either partially or completely, from the inner wall of the uterus
before delivery
• The mother has a medical condition that might put her or her baby at risk, such as high
blood pressure or diabetes (Mayo Clinic, 2014)
62

Assessing the Neonate
The Apgar assessment is conducted one
minute and five minutes after birth.
This is a very quick way to assess the
newborn's overall condition. Five
measures are assessed: Heart rate,
respiration, muscle tone (assessed by
touching the baby's palm), reflex
response (the Babinski reflex is tested),
and color. A score of 0 to 2 is given on
each feature examined. An Apgar of 5
or less is cause for concern. The second
Apgar should indicate improvement
with a higher score (see Figure 2.18).
Another way to assess the condition of
the newborn is the Neonatal Behavioral
Assessment Scale (NBAS). The baby's
motor development, muscle tone, and
stress response are assessed. This tool
has been used around the world to
further assess the newborn, especially
those with low Apgar scores, and to
make comparisons of infants in
different cultures (Brazelton & Nugent,
1995).

Figure 2.18 APGAR Scores

Problems of the Newborn
Anoxia: Anoxia is a temporary lack of
oxygen to the brain. Difficulty during delivery
may lead to anoxia which can result in brain
damage or in severe cases, death. Babies who
suffer both low birth weight and anoxia are
more likely to suffer learning disabilities later
in life as well.

Figure 2.19 Newborn in Neonatal Unit

Low Birth weight: We have been discussing
a number of teratogens associated with low
birth weight such as alcohol, tobacco, etc. A
child is considered low birth weight if he or
she weighs less than 5 pounds 8 ounces (2500
grams). About 8.2 percent of babies born in
Source
the United States are of low birth weight
(Center for Disease Control, 2015a). A low birth weight baby has difficulty maintaining
63

adequate body temperature because it lacks the fat that would otherwise provide insulation. Such
a baby is also at more risk for infection, and 67 percent of these babies are also preterm which
can make them more at risk for respiratory infection. Very low birth weight babies (2 pounds or
less) have an increased risk of developing cerebral palsy.
Additionally, Pettersson, Larsson, D’Onofrio, Almqvist, and Lichtenstein (2019) analyzed fetal
growth and found that reduced birth weight was correlated with a small, but significant increase
in several psychiatric disorders in adulthood. These included: attention-deficit/hyperactivity
disorder, autism, depression, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Pettersson et al. theorized that
“reduced fetal growth compromises brain development during a critical period, which in turn
slightly increases the risk not only for neurodevelopmental disorders but also for virtually all
mental health conditions” (p. 540). An insufficient supply of oxygen and nutrients for the
developing fetus are proposed as factors that increased the risk for neurodevelopmental
disorders.
Preterm: A newborn might also have a low birth weight if it is born at less than 37 weeks
gestation, which qualifies it as a preterm baby (CDC, 2015c). Early birth can be triggered by
anything that disrupts the mother's system. For instance, vaginal infections can lead to premature
birth because such infection causes the mother to release anti-inflammatory chemicals which, in
turn, can trigger contractions. Smoking and the use of other teratogens can lead to preterm
birth. The earlier a woman quits smoking, the lower the chance that the baby will be born
preterm (Someji & Beltrán-Sánchez, 2019). A significant consequence of preterm birth includes
respiratory distress syndrome, which is characterized by weak and irregular breathing (United
States National Library of Medicine, 2015b).
Figure 2.20 Saybie

Saybie (name given to her by the hospital), a baby
girl born in San Diego, California is now considered
the world’s smallest baby ever to survive (Chiu,
2019). She was born in December 2018 at 23 weeks
and 3 days weighing only 8.6 ounces (same size as
an apple). After five months in the hospital, Saybie
went home in May 2019 weighing 5 pounds.

Small-for-Date Infants: Infants that have birth
weights that are below expectation based on their
Source
gestational age are referred to as small-for-date.
These infants may be full term or preterm, but still
weigh less than 90 % of all babies of the same gestational age. This is a very serious situation
for newborns as their growth was adversely affected. Regev et al. (2003) found that small-fordate infants died at rates more than four times higher than other infants. Remember that many
causes of low birth weight and preterm births are preventable with proper prenatal care.

Postpartum Maternal Concerns
After pregnancy many women experience emotional changes. The “baby blues” are often
mentioned as a common occurrence in new mothers. The baby blues are feelings of sadness
that occur 3 to 5 days after having a baby, and typically disappear usually within 10 days of the
birth. New mothers may have trouble sleeping, be moody, and feel let-down from the birthing
experience. However, postpartum depression is not the same as the baby blues. According to the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5th edition (DSM-5), (American
Psychiatric Association, 2013), peripartum onset of depression, also known as postpartum
depression, is a type of depression that occurs during pregnancy or in the 4 weeks following
pregnancy. Approximately 1 out of 8 women experience postpartum depression and symptoms
can include feelings of sadness, sleeplessness, and difficulty bonding with the newborn.
Changing hormone levels are thought to be a factor in the occurrence of peripartum depression,
however, risk factors include having depression previously, a family history of depression, being
younger than 20, experiencing stress, and substance use. Peripartum-onset mood disorders, both
depression and mania, can present with or without psychotic features. Hallucinations and
delusions are associated with postpartum psychotic episodes and have included command
hallucinations to kill the infant or delusions that the infant is possessed. Psychotic features occur
in approximately 1 in 500 to 1 in 1,000 deliveries, and the risk is higher for women with prior
postpartum mood episodes (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).
Postpartum anxiety is also a concern for many new mothers. According to Bregel (2017) because
oxytocin, a bonding hormone, rises during preganancy, brain areas related to empathy and
anxiety are heightened. Consequently, the new mother is “hard-wired” to respond to and fend
for her baby, which can lead to toxic levels of stress and anxiety. These can manifest as
heightened alertness, intrusive and horrifying thoughts of something terrible happening to the
infant, and physiological arousal. Just as for peripartum depression and postpartum psychosis, a
new mother experiencing postpartum anxiety should seek assistance from a health care provider.

Chapter 3: Infancy and Toddlerhood
We will now turn our attention to the physical, cognitive, and socioemotional development
during the first two years. Researchers have given this part of the lifespan more attention than
any other period, perhaps because changes during this time are so dramatic and so noticeable.
We have also assumed that what happens during these years provides a foundation for one’s life
to come. However, it has been argued that the significance of development during these years
has been overstated (Bruer, 1999).

Overall Physical Growth: The average newborn in the United States weighs about 7.5 pounds
(between 5 and 10 pounds) and is about 20 inches in length. For the first few days of life, infants
typically lose about 5 percent of their body weight as they eliminate waste and get used to
feeding. This often goes unnoticed by most parents but can be cause for concern for those who
have a smaller infant. This weight loss is temporary, however, and is followed by a rapid period
of growth. By the time an infant is 4 months old, it usually doubles in weight and by one year has
tripled the birth weight. By age 2, the weight has quadrupled, so we can expect that a 2-year-old
should weigh between 20 and 40 pounds. The average length at one year is about 29.5 inches and
at two years it is around 34.4 inches (Bloem, 2007).
Body Proportions: Another dramatic physical change
that takes place in the first several years of life is the
change in body proportions. The head initially makes
up about 50 percent of our entire length when we are
developing in the womb. At birth, the head makes up
about 25 percent of our length, and by age 25 it
comprises about 20 percent our length.

Figure 3.1 Changes in Proportions

71

The Brain in the First Two Years
Some of the most dramatic physical change that occurs during this period is in the brain. We are
born with most of the brain cells that we will ever have; that is, about 85 billion neurons
whose function is to store and transmit information (Huttenlocher & Dabholkar, 1997). While
most of the brain’s neurons are present at birth, they are not fully mature. During the next
several years dendrites, or branching extensions that collect information from other neurons,
will undergo a period of exuberance. Because of this proliferation of dendrites, by age two a
single neuron might have thousands of dendrites. Synaptogenesis, or the formation of
connections between neurons, continues from the prenatal period forming thousands of new
connections during infancy and toddlerhood. This period of rapid neural growth is referred to
as synaptic blooming.
Figure 3.2 Components of the Neuron

Source

The blooming period of neural growth is then followed by a period of synaptic pruning, where
neural connections are reduced thereby making those that are used much stronger. It is
thought that pruning causes the brain to function more efficiently, allowing for mastery of
more complex skills (Kolb & Whishaw, 2011). Experience will shape which of these
connections are maintained and which of these are lost. Ultimately, about 40 percent of these
connections will be lost (Webb, Monk, and Nelson, 2001). Blooming occurs during the first few
years of life, and pruning continues through childhood and into adolescence in various areas of
the brain.

72

Another major change occurring in the central nervous system is the development of myelin, a
coating of fatty tissues around the axon of the neuron (Carlson, 2014). Myelin helps insulate the
nerve cell and speed the rate of transmission of impulses from one cell to another. This enhances
the building of neural pathways and improves coordination and control of movement and thought
processes. The development of myelin continues into adolescence but is most dramatic during
the first several years of life.
The infant brain grows very fast. At birth the brain is about 250 grams (half a pound) and by one
year it is already 750 grams (Eliot, 1999). Comparing to adult size, the newborn brain is
approximately 33% of adult size at birth, and in just 90 days, it is already at 55% of adult size
(Holland et al., 2014). Most of the neural activity is occurring in the cortex or the thin outer
covering of the brain involved in voluntary activity and thinking. The cortex is divided into two
hemispheres, and each hemisphere is divided into four lobes, each separated by folds known as
fissures. If we look at the cortex starting at the front of the brain and moving over the top (see
Figure 3.3), we see first the frontal lobe (behind the forehead), which is responsible primarily
for thinking, planning, memory, and judgment. Following the frontal lobe is the parietal lobe,
which extends from the middle to the back of the skull and which is responsible primarily for
processing information about touch. Next is the occipital lobe, at the very back of the skull,
which processes visual information. Finally, in front of the occipital lobe, between the ears, is the
temporal lobe, which is responsible for hearing and language (Jarrett, 2015).
Figure 3.3 The Two Hemispheres

The brain is divided into two hemispheres (left and right), each of which has four lobes (temporal, frontal,
occipital, and parietal). Furthermore, there are specific cortical areas that control different processes.
Source

Although the brain grows rapidly during infancy, specific brain regions do not mature at the
same rate. Primary motor areas develop earlier than primary sensory areas, and the prefrontal
cortex, that is located behind the forehead, is the least developed (Giedd, 2015). As the prefrontal
73

cortex matures, the child is increasingly able to regulate or control emotions, to plan activities,
strategize, and have better judgment. This is not fully accomplished in infancy and toddlerhood,
but continues throughout childhood, adolescence and into adulthood.
Lateralization is the process in which different functions become localized primarily on one side
of the brain. For example, in most adults the left hemisphere is more active than the right during
language production, while the reverse pattern is observed during tasks involving visuospatial
abilities (Springer & Deutsch, 1993). This process develops over time, however, structural
asymmetries between the hemispheres have been reported even in fetuses (Chi, Dooling, &
Gilles, 1997; Kasprian et al., 2011) and infants (Dubois et al., 2009).
Lastly, neuroplasticity refers to the brain’s ability to change, both physically and chemically, to
enhance its adaptability to environmental change and compensate for injury. The control of
some specific bodily functions, such as movement, vision, and hearing, is performed in specified
areas of the cortex, and if these areas are damaged, the individual will likely lose the ability to
perform the corresponding function. The brain’s neurons have a remarkable capacity to
reorganize and extend themselves to carry out these particular functions in response to the needs
of the organism, and to repair any damage. As a result, the brain constantly creates new neural
communication routes and rewires existing ones. Both environmental experiences, such as
stimulation and events within a person’s body, such as hormones and genes, affect the brain’s
plasticity. So too does age. Adult brains demonstrate neuroplasticity, but they are influenced
less extensively than those of infants (Kolb & Fantie, 1989; Kolb & Whishaw, 2011).

Infant Sleep
Figure 3.4
A newborn typically sleeps approximately 16.5
hours per 24-hour period. This is usually polyphasic
sleep in that the infant is accumulating the 16.5
hours over several sleep periods throughout the day
(Salkind, 2005). The infant is averaging 15 hours
per 24-hour period by one month, and 14 hours by 6
months. By the time children turn two, they are
averaging closer to 10 hours per 24 hours.
Additionally, the average newborn will spend close
to 50% of the sleep time in the Rapid Eye Movement (REM) phase, which decreases to 25% to
30% in childhood.
Sudden Unexpected Infant Deaths (SUID): Each year in the United States, there are about
3,500 Sudden Unexpected Infant Deaths (SUID). These deaths occur among infants less than
one-year-old and have no immediately obvious cause (CDC, 2019). The three commonly
reported types of SUID are:
•

Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS): SIDS is identified when the death of a
healthy infant occurs suddenly and unexpectedly, and medical and forensic investigation
findings (including an autopsy) are inconclusive. SIDS is the leading cause of death in
74

•

•

infants 1 to 12 months old, and approximately 1,400 infants died of SIDS in 2017 (CDC,
2019). Because SIDS is diagnosed when no other cause of death can be determined,
possible causes of SIDS are regularly researched. One leading hypothesis suggests that
infants who die from SIDS have abnormalities in the area of the brainstem responsible for
regulating breathing (Weekes-Shackelford & Shackelford, 2005).
Unknown Cause: The sudden death of an infant less than one year of age that cannot be
explained because a thorough investigation was not conducted, and cause of death could
not be determined. In 2017, 1300 infants died from unknown causes (CDC, 2019).
Accidental Suffocation and Strangulation in Bed: Reasons for accidental suffocation
include: Suffocation by soft bedding, another person rolling on top of or against the
infant while sleeping, an infant being wedged between two objects such as a mattress and
wall, and strangulation such as when an infant’s head and neck become caught between
crib railings. In 2017, 900 infants died from accidental suffocation and strangulation.
The 2017 percentages of infants who died based on each of the three types are listed in
Figure 3.5.

Figure 3.5

As can be seen in the next graph (Figure 3.6), the combined SUID death rate declined
considerably following the release of the American Academy of Pediatrics safe sleep
recommendations in 1992, which advocated that infants be placed for sleep on their backs
(nonprone position). These recommendations were followed by a major Back to Sleep
Campaign in 1994. However, accidental suffocation and strangulation in bed mortality rates
remained unchanged until the late 1990s. In 1998 death rates from accidental suffocation and
strangulation in bed actually started to increase, and they reached the highest rate at 24.6 deaths
per 100,000 live births in 2017 (CDC, 2019).

Figure 3.6

Should infants be sharing the bed with parents?
Colvin, Collie-Akers, Schunn and Moon (2014) analyzed
a total of 8207 deaths from 24 states during 2004–2012
that were contained in the National Center for the Review
and Prevention of Child Deaths Case Reporting System, a
database of death reports from state child death review
teams. The results indicated that younger victims (0-3
months) were more likely to die by bed-sharing and
sleeping in an adult bed/on a person. A higher percentage
of older victims (4 months to 364 days) rolled into objects
Source
in the sleep environment and changed position from
side/back to prone. Carpenter et al. (2013) compared infants who died of SIDS with a matched
control and found that infants younger than three months old who slept in bed with a parent
were five times more likely to die of SIDS compared to babies who slept separately from the
parents but were still in the same room. They concluded that bed sharing, even when the parents
do not smoke or take alcohol or drugs, increases the risk of SIDS. However, when combined
with parental smoking and maternal alcohol consumption and/or drug use, risks associated with
bed sharing greatly increased.
Figure 3.7

The two studies discussed above were based on American statistics. What about the rest of the
world? Co-sleeping occurs in many cultures, primarily because of a more collectivist
perspective that encourages a close parent-child bond and interdependent relationship (Morelli,
Rogoff, Oppenheim, & Goldsmith, 1992). In countries where co-sleeping is common, however,
76

parents and infants typically sleep on floor mats and other hard surfaces which minimize the
suffocation that can occur with bedding (Nelson, Schiefenhoevel, & Haimerl, 2000).

Newborns are equipped with a number of reflexes (see Table 3.1) which are involuntary
movements in response to stimulation. Some of the more common reflexes, such as the sucking
reflex and rooting reflex, are important to feeding. The grasping and stepping reflexes are
eventually replaced by more voluntary behaviors. Within the first few months of life these
reflexes disappear, while other reflexes, such as the eye-blink, swallowing, sneezing, gagging,
and withdrawal reflex stay with us as they continue to serve important functions. Reflexes offer
pediatricians insight into the maturation and health of the nervous system. Reflexes that persist
longer than they should can impede normal development (Berne, 2006). In preterm infants and
those with neurological impairments, some of these reflexes may be absent at birth. Once
present, they may persist longer than in a neurologically healthy infant (El-Dib, Massaro, Glass
& Aly, 2012).

Motor Development
Motor development occurs in an orderly sequence as infants move from reflexive reactions
(e.g., sucking and rooting) to more advanced motor functioning. As mentioned during the
prenatal section, development occurs according to the Cephalocaudal (from head to tail) and
Proximodistal (from the midline outward) principles. For instance, babies first learn to hold
their heads up, then to sit with assistance, then to sit unassisted, followed later by crawling,
pulling up, cruising or walking while holding on to something, and then unassisted walking
(Eisenberg, Murkoff, & Hathaway, 1989). As motor skills develop, there are certain
developmental milestones that young children should achieve. For each milestone there is an
average age, as well as a range of ages in which the milestone should be reached. An example of
a developmental milestone is a baby holding up its head. Babies on average are able to hold up
their head at 6 weeks old, and 90% of babies achieve this between 3 weeks and 4 months old.
On average, most babies sit alone at 7 months old. Sitting involves both coordination and
muscle strength, and 90% of babies achieve this milestone between 5 and 9 months old. If the
child is displaying delays on several milestones, that is reason for concern, and the parent or
caregiver should discuss this with the child’s pediatrician. Developmental delays can be
identified and addressed through early intervention.

Motor Skills refer to our ability to move our bodies and manipulate
objects. Fine motor skills focus on the muscles in our fingers, toes,
and eyes, and enable coordination of small actions (e.g., grasping a
toy, writing with a pencil, and using a spoon). Newborns cannot
grasp objects voluntarily but do wave their arms toward objects of
interest. At about 4 months of age, the infant is able to reach for an
object, first with both arms and within a few weeks, with only one
arm. At this age grasping an object involves the use of the fingers and
palm, but no thumbs. This is known as the Palmer Grasp. The use
of the thumb comes at about 9 months of age when the infant is able
to grasp an object using the forefinger and thumb. Now the infant
uses a Pincer Grasp, and this ability greatly enhances the ability to
control and manipulate an object and infants take great delight in this
newfound ability. They may spend hours picking up small objects

78

from the floor and placing them in containers. By 9 months, an infant can also watch a moving
object, reach for it as it approaches, and grab it.
Gross motor skills focus on large muscle groups that control our head, torso, arms and legs
and involve larger movements (e.g., balancing, running, and jumping). These skills begin to
develop first. Examples include moving to bring the chin up when lying on the stomach, moving
the chest up, and rocking back and forth on hands and knees. But it also includes exploring an
object with one’s feet as many babies do as early as 8 weeks of age if seated in a carrier or other
device that frees the hips. This may be easier than reaching for an object with the hands, which
requires much more practice (Berk, 2007). Sometimes an infant will try to move toward an
object while crawling and surprisingly move backward because of the greater amount of strength
in the arms than in the legs.

Sensory Capacities
Throughout much of history, the newborn was considered a passive, disorganized being who
possessed minimal abilities. William James, an early psychologist, had described the newborn’s
world as “a blooming, buzzing confusion,” (Shaffer, 1985). However, current research
techniques have demonstrated just how developed the newborn is with especially organized
sensory and perceptual abilities.
Vision: The womb is a dark environment void of visual stimulation. Consequently, vision is one
of the most poorly developed senses at birth, and time is needed to build those neural pathways
between the eyes and the brain (American Optometric Association [AOA], 2019). Newborns
typically cannot see further than 8 to 10 inches away from their faces (AOA, 2019). An 8-week
old’s vision is 20/300. This means an object 20 feet away from an infant has the same clarity as
an object 300 feet away from an adult with normal vision. By 3-months visual acuity has
sharpened to 20/200, which would allow them the see the letter E at the top of a standard eye
chart (Hamer, 2016). As a result, the world looks blurry to young infants (Johnson & deHaan,
2015).
Why is visual acuity so poor in the infant? The fovea, which is the central field of vision in the
retina and allows us to see sharp detail, is not fully developed at birth, and does not start to
reach adult levels of development until 15 months (Li & Ding, 2017). Even by 45 months some
of the sensory neurons (cones) of the fovea are still not fully grown. Can babies see color?
Young infants can perceive color, but the colors need to be very pure forms of basic colors, such
as vivid red or green rather than weaker pastel shades. Most studies report that babies can see the
full spectrum of colors by five months of age (AOA, 2019).
Newborn infants prefer and orient to face-like stimuli more than they do other patterned stimuli
(Farroni et al., 2005). They also prefer images of faces that are upright and not scrambled (Chien,
2011). Infants also quickly learn to distinguish the face of their mother from faces of other
women (Bartrip, Morton, & De Schonen, 2001). When viewing a person’s face, one-month olds
fixate on the outer edges of the face rather than the eyes, nose, or mouth, and two-month olds
gaze more at the inner features, especially the eyes (Hainline, 1978).

79

Researchers have examined the development of attention and tracking in the visual system and
have found the following for young infants:
• One-month-olds have difficulty disengaging their attention and can spend several minutes
fixedly gazing at a stimulus (Johnson & deHaan, 2015).
• Aslin (1981) found that when tracking an object visually, the eye movements of
newborns and one-month olds are not smooth but saccadic, that is step-like jerky
movements. Aslin also found their eye movements lag behind the object’s motion. This
means young infants do not anticipate the trajectory of the object. By two months of age,
their eye movements are becoming smoother, but they still lag behind the motion of the
object and will not achieve this until about three to four months of age (Johnson &
deHaan, 2015).
• Newborns also orient more to the visual field toward the side of the head, than to the
visual field on either side of the nose (Lewis, Maurer, & Milewski, 1979). By two to
three months, stimuli in both fields are now equally attended to (Johnson & deHaan,
2015).
Binocular vision, which requires input from both eyes, is evident around the third month and
continues to develop during the first six months (Atkinson & Braddick, 2003). By six months
infants can perceive depth perception in pictures as well (Sen, Yonas, & Knill, 2001). Infants
who have experience crawling and exploring will pay greater attention to visual cues of depth
and modify their actions accordingly (Berk, 2007).
Hearing: The infant’s sense of hearing is very keen at
Figure 3.9
birth, and the ability to hear is evidenced as soon as
the seventh month of prenatal development. Newborns
prefer their mother’s voices over another female when
speaking the same material (DeCasper & Fifer, 1980).
Additionally, they will register in utero specific
information heard from their mother’s voice.
DeCasper and Spence (1986) tested 16 infants
(average age of 55.8 hours) whose mothers had
previously read to them prenatally. The mothers read
Source
several passages to their fetuses, including the first 28
paragraphs of the Cat in the Hat, beginning when they
were 7 months pregnant. The fetuses had been exposed to the stories an average of 67 times or
3.5 hours. When the experimental infants were tested, the target stories (previously heard) were
more reinforcing than the novel story as measured by their rate of sucking. However, for control
infants, the target stories were not more reinforcing than the novel story indicating that the
experimental infants had heard them before.
An infant can distinguish between very similar sounds as early as one month after birth and can
distinguish between a familiar and non-familiar voice even earlier. Infants are especially
sensitive to the frequencies of sounds in human speech and prefer the exaggeration of infantdirected speech, which will be discussed later. Additionally, infants are innately ready to respond
to the sounds of any language, but between six and nine months they show preference for
listening to their native language (Jusczyk, Cutler, & Redanz, 1993). Their ability to distinguish
80

the sounds that are not in the language around them diminishes rapidly (Cheour-Luhtanen, et al.,
1995).
Touch and Pain: Immediately after birth, a newborn is sensitive to touch and temperature, and
is also highly sensitive to pain, responding with crying and cardiovascular responses (Balaban &
Reisenauer, 2013). Newborns who are circumcised, which is the surgical removal of the
foreskin of the penis, without anesthesia experience pain as demonstrated by increased blood
pressure, increased heart rate, decreased oxygen in the blood, and a surge of stress hormones
(United States National Library of Medicine, 2016). Research has demonstrated that infants who
were circumcised without anesthesia experienced more pain and fear during routine childhood
vaccines. Fortunately, today many local pain killers are currently used during circumcision.
Figure 3.10

Taste and Smell: Studies of taste and smell
demonstrate that babies respond with different
facial expressions, suggesting that certain
preferences are innate. Newborns can distinguish
between sour, bitter, sweet, and salty flavors and
show a preference for sweet flavors. Newborns
also prefer the smell of their mothers. An infant
only 6 days old is significantly more likely to
turn toward its own mother’s breast pad than to
the breast pad of another baby’s mother (Porter,
Makin, Davis, & Christensen, 1992), and within
hours of birth an infant also shows a preference
for the face of its own mother (Bushnell, 2001;
Bushnell, Sai, & Mullin, 1989).

Intermodality: Infants seem to be born with the ability to perceive the world in an intermodal
way; that is, through stimulation from more than one sensory modality. For example, infants who
sucked on a pacifier with either a smooth or textured surface preferred to look at a corresponding
(smooth or textured) visual model of the pacifier. By 4 months, infants can match lip movements
with speech sounds and can match other audiovisual events. Sensory processes are certainly
affected by the infant's developing motor abilities (Hyvärinen, Walthes, Jacob, Nottingham
Chapin, & Leonhardt, 2014). Reaching, crawling, and other actions allow the infant to see,
touch, and organize his or her experiences in new ways.
How are Infants Tested: Habituation procedures, that is measuring decreased
responsiveness to a stimulus after repeated presentations, have increasingly been used to
evaluate infants to study the development of perceptual and memory skills. Phelps (2005)
describes a habituation procedure used when measuring the rate of the sucking reflex.
Researchers first measure the initial baseline rate of sucking to a pacifier equipped with
transducers that measure muscle contractions. Next, an auditory stimulus is presented, such as a
human voice uttering a speech sound such as “da.” The rate of sucking will typically increase
with the new sound, but then decrease to baseline levels as “da” is repeatedly presented, showing
habituation. If the sound “ma” was then presented, the rate of sucking would again increase,
demonstrating that the infant can discriminate between these two stimuli.
81

Additionally, the speed or efficiency with which infants show habituation has been shown to
predict outcomes in behaviors, such as language acquisition and verbal and nonverbal
intelligence. Infants who show difficulty during habituation, or habituate at slower than normal
rates, have been found to be at an increased risk for significant developmental delays. Infants
with Down syndrome, teratogen-exposed infants, malnourished infants, and premature infants
have all been studied. Researchers have found that at the age of 16 months, high-risk infants
show rates of habituation comparable to newborn infants (Phelps, 2005).

Nutrition
Figure 3.11
Breast milk is considered the ideal diet for newborns.
Colostrum, the first breast milk produced during pregnancy
and just after birth has been described as “liquid gold” (United
States Department of Health and Human Services (USDHHS),
2011). It is very rich in nutrients and antibodies. Breast milk
changes by the third to fifth day after birth, becoming much
thinner, but containing just the right amount of fat, sugar,
water, and proteins to support overall physical and
neurological development. For most babies, breast milk is also
easier to digest than formula. Formula fed infants experience
more diarrhea and upset stomachs. The absence of antibodies
Source
in formula often results in a higher rate of ear infections and
respiratory infections. Children who are breastfed have lower
rates of childhood leukemia, asthma, obesity, type 1 and 2 diabetes, and a lower risk of SIDS.
The USDHHS recommends that mothers breast feed their infants until at least 6 months of age,
and that breast milk be used in the diet throughout the first year or two.
Several recent studies have reported that it is not just babies that benefit from breastfeeding.
Breastfeeding stimulates contractions in the uterus to help it regain its normal size, and women
who breastfeed are more likely to space their pregnancies further apart. Mothers who breastfeed
are at lower risk of developing breast cancer (Islami et al., 2015), especially among higher risk
racial and ethnic groups (Islami et al., 2015; Redondo et al., 2012). Women who breastfeed have
lower rates of ovarian cancer (Titus-Ernstoff, Rees, Terry, & Cramer, 2010), reduced risk for
developing Type 2 diabetes (Schwarz et al., 2010; Gunderson, et al., 2015), and rheumatoid
arthritis (Karlson, Mandl, Hankinson, & Grodstein, 2004). In most studies these benefits have
been seen in women who breastfeed longer than 6 months.
Current rates of breastfeeding indicate that 83.2% of mothers have breastfed their infants at some
point (CDC, 2018). However, most mothers who breastfeed in the United States stop
breastfeeding exclusively at about 6-8 weeks, often in order to return to work outside the home
(USDHHS, 2011). Mothers can certainly continue to provide breast milk to their babies by
expressing and freezing the milk to be bottle fed at a later time or by being available to their
infants at feeding time. However, some mothers find that after the initial encouragement they
receive in the hospital to breastfeed, the outside world is less supportive of such efforts. Some
workplaces support breastfeeding mothers by providing flexible schedules and welcoming
infants, but many do not. In addition, not all women may be able to breastfeed. Women with
82

HIV are routinely discouraged from breastfeeding as the infection may pass to the infant.
Similarly, women who are taking certain medications or undergoing radiation treatment may be
told not to breastfeed (USDHHS, 2011).
Besides the nutritional benefits of breastfeeding, breast
milk is free. Anyone who has priced formula recently
can appreciate this added incentive to
breastfeeding. Prices for a year’s worth of formula and
feeding supplies can cost between $1,500 and $3000 per
year (Los Angles County Department of Public Health,
2019). In addition to the formula, costs include bottles,
nipples, sterilizers, and other supplies.
One early argument given to promote the practice of
breastfeeding was that it promoted bonding and healthy
emotional development for infants. However, this does
not seem to be the case. Breastfed and bottle-fed infants
adjust equally well emotionally (Ferguson &
Woodward, 1999). This is good news for mothers who
may be unable to breastfeed for a variety of reasons and
for fathers who might feel left out.

When to Introduce More Solid Foods: Solid foods should not be introduced until the infant is
ready. According to The Clemson University Cooperative Extension (2014), some things to look
for include that the infant:
•
•
•
•
•
•

can sit up without needing support
can hold its head up without wobbling
shows interest in foods others are eating
is still hungry after being breastfed or formula fed
is able to move foods from the front to the back of the mouth
is able to turn away when they have had enough

For many infants who are 4 to 6 months of age, breast milk or formula can be supplemented with
more solid foods. The first semi-solid foods that are introduced are iron-fortified infant cereals
mixed with breast milk or formula. Typically rice, oatmeal, and barley cereals are offered as a
number of infants are sensitive to more wheat-based cereals. Finger foods such as toast squares,
cooked vegetable strips, or peeled soft fruit can be introduced by 10-12 months. New foods
should be introduced one at a time, and the new food should be fed for a few days in a row to
allow the baby time to adjust to the new food. This also allows parents time to assess if the child
has a food allergy. Foods that have multiple ingredients should be avoided until parents have
assessed how the child responds to each ingredient separately. Foods that are sticky (such as
peanut butter or taffy), cut into large chunks (such as cheese and harder meats), and firm and
round (such as hard candies, grapes, or cherry tomatoes) should be avoided as they are a choking
hazard. Honey and corn syrup should be avoided as these often contain botulism spores. In

83

children under 12 months, this can lead to death (Clemson University Cooperative Extension,
2014).

Global Considerations and Malnutrition
Children in developing countries and countries experiencing the harsh conditions of war are at
risk for two major types of malnutrition, also referred to as wasting. Infantile marasmus refers
to starvation due to a lack of calories and protein. Children who do not receive adequate
nutrition lose fat and muscle until their bodies can no longer function. Babies who are breastfed
are much less at risk of malnutrition than those who are bottle-fed.
After weaning, children who have diets
deficient in protein may experience
kwashiorkor known as the “disease of the
displaced child” often occurring after another
child has been born and taken over
breastfeeding. This results in a loss of appetite
and swelling of the abdomen as the body
begins to break down the vital organs as a
source of protein.

Figure 3.13 Kwashiorkor

Around the world the rates of wasting have
been dropping. However, according to the
World Health Organization and UNICEF, in
2014 there were 50 million children under the
age of five that experienced these forms of
(Photo Courtesy Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)
wasting, and 16 million were severely wasted
(UNICEF, 2015). This works out to 1 child
in every 13 children in the world suffers from some form of wasting, and the majority of these
children live in Asia (34.3 million) and Africa (13.9 million). Wasting can occur as a result of
severe food shortages, regional diets that lack certain proteins and vitamins, or infectious
diseases that inhibit appetite (Latham, 1997).
The consequences of wasting depend on how late in the progression of the disease parents and
guardians seek medical treatment for their children. Unfortunately, in some cultures families do
not seek treatment early, and as a result by the time a child is hospitalized the child often dies
within the first three days after admission (Latham, 1997). Several studies have reported longterm cognitive effects of early malnutrition (Galler & Ramsey, 1989; Galler, Ramsey, Salt &
Archer, 1987; Richardson, 1980), even when home environments were controlled (Galler,
Ramsey, Morley, Archer & Salt, 1990). Lower IQ scores (Galler et al., 1987), poor attention
(Galler & Ramsey, 1989), and behavioral issues in the classroom (Galler et al., 1990) have been
reported in children with a history of serious malnutrition in the first few years of life.

Piaget and the Sensorimotor Stage
Schema, Assimilation and Accommodation: Piaget believed that we are continuously trying to
maintain cognitive equilibrium, or a balance, in what we see and what we know (Piaget, 1954).
Children have much more of a challenge in maintaining this balance because they are constantly
being confronted with new situations, new words, new objects, etc. All this new information
needs to be organized, and a framework for organizing information is referred to as a schema.
Children develop schemata through the processes of assimilation and accommodation.

When faced with
something new, a child
may demonstrate
assimilation, which is
fitting the new
information into an
existing schema, such as
calling all animals with
four legs "doggies"
because he or she knows
the word doggie. Instead
of assimilating the
information, the child
may demonstrate
accommodation, which is
expanding the framework
of knowledge to
accommodate the new
situation and thus
learning a new word to
more accurately name the
Source
animal. For example,
recognizing that a horse is
different than a zebra means the child has accommodated, and now the child has both a zebra
schema and a horse schema. Even as adults we continue to try and "make sense" of new
Figure 3.14 Assimilation and Accommodation

85

situations by determining whether they fit into our old way of thinking (assimilation) or whether
we need to modify our thoughts (accommodation).
According to the Piagetian perspective, infants learn about the world primarily through their
senses and motor abilities (Harris, 2005). These basic motor and sensory abilities provide the
foundation for the cognitive skills that will emerge during the subsequent stages of cognitive
development. The first stage of cognitive development is referred to as the sensorimotor stage
and it occurs through six substages. Table 3.2 identifies the ages typically associated with each
substage.

Substage 1: Reflexes. Newborns learn about their world through the use of their reflexes, such
as when sucking, reaching, and grasping. Eventually the use of these reflexes becomes more
deliberate and purposeful.
Substage 2: Primary Circular Reactions. During these next 3 months, the infant begins to
actively involve his or her own body in some form of repeated activity. An infant may
accidentally engage in a behavior and find it interesting such as making a vocalization. This
interest motivates trying to do it again and helps the infant learn a new behavior that originally
occurred by chance. The behavior is identified as circular because of the repetition, and as
primary because it centers on the infant's own body.
Substage 3: Secondary Circular Reactions. The infant
begins to interact with objects in the environment. At
first the infant interacts with objects (e.g., a crib mobile)
accidentally, but then these contacts with the objects are
deliberate and become a repeated activity. The infant
becomes more and more actively engaged in the outside
world and takes delight in being able to make things
happen. Repeated motion brings particular interest as, for
example, the infant is able to bang two lids together from
the cupboard when seated on the kitchen floor.
Substage 4: Coordination of Secondary Circular
Reactions. The infant combines these basic reflexes and
simple behaviors and uses planning and coordination to
achieve a specific goal. Now the infant can engage in
86

Figure 3.15

Source

behaviors that others perform and anticipate upcoming events. Perhaps because of continued
maturation of the prefrontal cortex, the infant become capable of having a thought and carrying
out a planned, goal-directed activity. For example, an infant sees a toy car under the kitchen
table and then crawls, reaches, and grabs the toy. The infant is coordinating both internal and
external activities to achieve a planned goal.
Substage 5: Tertiary Circular Reactions. The toddler is considered a “little scientist” and
begins exploring the world in a trial-and-error manner, using both motor skills and planning
abilities. For example, the child might throw her ball down the stairs to see what happens. The
toddler’s active engagement in experimentation helps them learn about their world.

Figure 3.16

Substage 6: Beginning of Representational
Thought. The sensorimotor period ends with the
appearance of symbolic or representational
thought. The toddler now has a basic
understanding that objects can be used as
symbols. Additionally, the child is able to solve
problems using mental strategies, to remember
something heard days before and repeat it, and to
engage in pretend play. This initial movement
from a “hands-on” approach to knowing about
the world to the more mental world of substage
six marks the transition to preoperational thought.

Source

Development of Object Permanence: A critical milestone during the sensorimotor period is
the development of object permanence. Object permanence is the understanding that even if
something is out of sight, it still exists (Bogartz, Shinskey, & Schilling, 2000). According to
Piaget, young infants do not remember an object after it has been removed from sight. Piaget
studied infants’ reactions when a toy was first shown to them and then hidden under a blanket.
Infants who had already developed object permanence would reach for the hidden toy,
indicating that they knew it still existed, whereas infants who had not developed object
permanence would appear confused. Piaget emphasizes this construct because it was an
objective way for children to demonstrate that they can mentally represent their world.
Children have typically acquired this milestone by 8 months. Once toddlers have mastered
Sourcepermanence, they enjoy games like hide and seek, and they realize that when someone
object
leaves the room they will come back. Toddlers also point to pictures in books and look in
appropriate places when you ask them to find objects.
In Piaget’s view, around the same time children develop object permanence, they also begin
to exhibit stranger anxiety, which is a fear of unfamiliar people (Crain, 2005). Babies may
demonstrate this by crying and turning away from a stranger, by clinging to a caregiver, or by
attempting to reach their arms toward familiar faces, such as parents. Stranger anxiety results
when a child is unable to assimilate the stranger into an existing schema; therefore, she cannot
predict what her experience with that stranger will be like, which results in a fear response.
87

Critique of Piaget: Piaget thought that children’s ability to understand objects, such as
learning that a rattle makes a noise when shaken, was a cognitive skill that develops slowly
as a child matures and interacts with the environment. Today, developmental psychologists
think Piaget was incorrect. Researchers have found that even very young children understand
objects and how they work long before they have experience with those objects (Baillargeon,
1987; Baillargeon, Li, Gertner, & Wu, 2011). For example, Piaget believed that infants did not
fully master object permanence until substage 5 of the sensorimotor period (Thomas, 1979).
However, infants seem to be able to recognize that objects have permanence at much younger
ages. Diamond (1985) found that infants show earlier knowledge if the waiting period is shorter.
At age 6 months, they retrieved the hidden object if their wait for retrieving the object is no
longer than 2 seconds, and at 7 months if the wait is no longer than 4 seconds.
Others have found that children as young as 3 months old have demonstrated knowledge of
the properties of objects that they had only viewed and did not have prior experience with. In
one study, 3-month-old infants were shown a truck rolling down a track and behind a screen.
The box, which appeared solid but was actually hollow, was placed next to the track. The
truck rolled past the box as would be expected. Then the box was placed on the track to block
the path of the truck. When the truck was rolled down the track this time, it continued
unimpeded. The infants spent significantly more time looking at this impossible event (Figure
3.17). Baillargeon (1987) concluded that they knew solid objects cannot pass through each other.
Baillargeon’s findings suggest that very young children have an understanding of objects and
how they work, which Piaget (1954) would have said is beyond their cognitive abilities due
to their limited experiences in the world.

Figure 3.17

In Baillargeon’s (1987) study, infants observed a truck (a) roll down an unobstructed track, (b) roll down an
unobstructed track with an obstruction (box) beside it, and (c) roll down and pass through what appeared to be
an obstruction.

Infant Memory
Memory requires a certain degree of brain maturation, so it should not be surprising that infant
memory is rather fleeting and fragile. As a result, older children and adults experience infantile
amnesia, the inability to recall memories from the first few years of life. Several hypotheses have
been proposed for this amnesia. From the biological perspective, it has been suggested that
infantile amnesia is due to the immaturity of the infant brain, especially those areas that are
88

crucial to the formation of autobiographical memory, such as the hippocampus. From the
cognitive perspective, it has been suggested that the lack of linguistic skills of babies and
toddlers limit their ability to mentally represent events; thereby, reducing their ability to encode
memory. Moreover, even if infants do form such early memories, older children and adults may
not be able to access them because they may be employing very different, more linguistically
based, retrieval cues than infants used when forming the memory. Finally, social theorists argue
that episodic memories of personal experiences may hinge on an understanding of “self”,
something that is clearly lacking in infants and young toddlers.
However, in a series of clever studies Carolyn Rovee-Collier and her colleagues have
demonstrated that infants can remember events from their life, even if these memories are shortlived. Three-month-old infants were taught that they could make a mobile hung over their crib
shake by kicking their legs. The infants were placed in their crib, on their backs. A ribbon was
tied to one foot and the other end to a mobile. At first infants made random movements, but then
came to realize that by kicking they could make the mobile shake. After two 9-minute sessions
with the mobile, the mobile was removed. One week later the mobile was reintroduced to one
group of infants and most of the babies immediately started kicking their legs, indicating that
they remembered their prior experience with the mobile. A second group of infants was shown
the mobile two weeks later, and the babies made only random movements. The memory had
faded (Rovee-Collier, 1987; Giles & Rovee-Collier, 2011). Rovee-Collier and Hayne (1987)
found that 3-month-olds could remember the mobile after two weeks if they were shown the
mobile and watched it move, even though they were not tied to it. This reminder helped most
infants to remember the connection between their kicking and the movement of the mobile. Like
many researchers of infant memory, Rovee-Collier (1990) found infant memory to be very
context dependent. In other words, the sessions with the mobile and the later retrieval sessions
had to be conducted under very similar circumstances or else the babies would not remember
their prior experiences with the mobile. For instance, if the first mobile had had yellow blocks
with blue letters, but at the later retrieval session the blocks were blue with yellow letters, the
babies would not kick.
Infants older than 6 months of age can retain information for longer periods of time; they also
need less reminding to retrieve information in memory. Studies of deferred imitation, that is,
the imitation of actions after a time delay, can occur as early as six-months of age (Campanella
& Rovee-Collier, 2005), but only if infants are allowed to practice the behavior they were shown.
By 12 months of age, infants no longer need to practice the behavior in order to retain the
memory for four weeks (Klein & Meltzoff, 1999).

Language
Our vast intelligence also allows us to have language, a system of communication that uses
symbols in a regular way to create meaning. Language gives us the ability to communicate our
intelligence to others by talking, reading, and writing. Although other species have at least some
ability to communicate, none of them have language. There are many components of language
that will now be reviewed.

89

Components of Language
Phoneme: A phoneme is the smallest unit of sound that makes a
meaningful difference in a language. The word “bit” has three
phonemes. In spoken languages, phonemes are produced by the
positions and movements of the vocal tract, including our lips,
teeth, tongue, vocal cords, and throat, whereas in sign languages
phonemes are defined by the shapes and movement of the hands.

Figure 3.18

There are hundreds of unique phonemes that can be made by
human speakers, but most languages only use a small subset of
the possibilities. English contains about 45 phonemes, whereas
other languages have as few as 15 and others more than 60. The
Hawaiian language contains less phonemes as it includes only 5
vowels (a, e, i, o, and u) and 7 consonants (h, k, l, m, n, p, and w).
Infants are born able to detect all phonemes, but they lose their
ability to do so as they get older; by 10 months of age a child’s ability to recognize phonemes
becomes very similar to that of the adult speakers of the native language. Phonemes that were
initially differentiated come to be treated as equivalent (Werker & Tees, 2002).
Morpheme: Whereas phonemes are the smallest units of sound in language, a morpheme is a
string of one or more phonemes that makes up the smallest units of meaning in a language.
Some morphemes are prefixes and suffixes used to modify other words. For example, the syllable
“re-” as in “rewrite” or “repay” means “to do again,” and the suffix “-est” as in “happiest” or
“coolest” means “to the maximum.”
Semantics: Semantics refers to the set of rules we use to obtain meaning from morphemes. For
example, adding “ed” to the end of a verb makes it past tense.
Syntax: Syntax is the set of rules of a language by which we construct sentences. Each language
has a different syntax. The syntax of the English language requires that each sentence have a
noun and a verb, each of which may be modified by adjectives and adverbs. Some syntaxes
make use of the order in which words appear. For example, in English the meaning of the
sentence “The man bites the dog” is different from “The dog bites the man.”
Pragmatics: The social side of language is expressed through pragmatics, or how we
communicate effectively and appropriately with others. Examples of pragmatics include turntaking, staying on topic, volume and tone of voice, and appropriate eye contact.
Lastly, words do not possess fixed meanings, but change their interpretation as a function of the
context in which they are spoken. We use contextual information, the information surrounding
language, to help us interpret it. Examples of contextual information include our knowledge and
nonverbal expressions, such as facial expressions, postures, and gestures. Misunderstandings can
easily arise if people are not attentive to contextual information or if some of it is missing, such
as it may be in newspaper headlines or in text messages.
90

Language Developmental Progression
An important aspect of cognitive development is language acquisition. The order in which
children learn language structures is consistent across children and cultures (Hatch, 1983).
Starting before birth, babies begin to develop language and communication skills. At birth,
babies recognize their mother’s voice and can discriminate between the language(s) spoken by
their mothers and foreign languages, and they show preferences for faces that are moving in
synchrony with audible language (Blossom & Morgan, 2006; Pickens et al., 1994; Spelke &
Cortelyou, 1981).
Do newborns communicate? Of course, they do. They do not,
however, communicate with the use of oral language. Instead, they
communicate their thoughts and needs with body posture (being
relaxed or still), gestures, cries, and facial expressions. A person
who spends adequate time with an infant can learn which cries
indicate pain and which ones indicate hunger, discomfort, or
frustration.

Figure 3.19

Intentional Vocalizations: In terms of producing spoken
language, babies begin to coo almost immediately. Cooing is a one-syllable combination of a
consonant and a vowel sound (e.g., coo or ba). Interestingly, babies replicate sounds from their
own languages. A baby whose parents speak French will coo in a different tone than a baby
whose parents speak Spanish or Urdu. These gurgling, musical vocalizations can serve as a
source of entertainment to an infant who has been laid down for a nap or seated in a carrier on a
car ride. Cooing serves as practice for vocalization, as well as the infant hears the sound of his
or her own voice and tries to repeat sounds that are entertaining. Infants also begin to learn the
pace and pause of conversation as they alternate their vocalization with that of someone else
and then take their turn again when the other person’s vocalization has stopped.
At about four to six months of age, infants begin making even more elaborate vocalizations that
include the sounds required for any language. Guttural sounds, clicks, consonants, and vowel
sounds stand ready to equip the child with the ability to repeat whatever sounds are
characteristic of the language heard. Eventually, these sounds will no longer be used as the
infant grows more accustomed to a particular language.
At about 7 months, infants begin babbling, engaging in intentional vocalizations that lack
specific meaning and comprise a consonant-vowel repeated sequence, such as ma-ma-ma, da-dada. Children babble as practice in creating specific sounds, and by the time they are a 1 year old,
the babbling uses primarily the sounds of the language that they are learning (de BoyssonBardies, Sagart, & Durand, 1984). These vocalizations have a conversational tone that sounds
meaningful even though it is not. Babbling also helps children understand the social,
communicative function of language. Children who are exposed to sign language babble in sign
by making hand movements that represent real language (Petitto & Marentette, 1991).
Gesturing: Children communicate information through gesturing long before they speak, and
there is some evidence that gesture usage predicts subsequent language development
91

(Iverson & Goldin-Meadow, 2005). Deaf babies also use gestures to communicate wants,
reactions, and feelings. Because gesturing seems to be easier than vocalization for some
toddlers, sign language is sometimes taught to enhance one’s ability to communicate by making
use of the ease of gesturing. The rhythm and pattern of language is used when deaf babies sign,
just as it is when hearing babies babble.
Understanding: At around ten months of age, the infant can understand more than he or she
can say, which is referred to as receptive language. You may have experienced this
phenomenon as well if you have ever tried to learn a second language. You may have been able
to follow a conversation more easily than contribute to it. One of the first words that children
understand is their own name, usually by about 6 months, followed by commonly used words
like “bottle,” “mama,” and “doggie” by 10 to 12 months (Mandel, Jusczyk, & Pisoni, 1995).
Infants shake their head “no” around 6–9 months, and they respond to verbal requests to do
things like “wave bye-bye” or “blow a kiss” around 9–12 months. Children also use
contextual information, particularly the cues that parents provide, to help them learn language.
Children learn that people are usually referring to things that they are looking at when they are
speaking (Baldwin, 1993), and that that the speaker’s emotional expressions are related to the
content of their speech.
Holophrasic Speech: Children begin using their first words at about 12 or 13 months of age
and may use partial words to convey thoughts at even younger ages. These one-word
expressions are referred to as holophrasic speech. For example, the child may say “ju” for the
word “juice” and use this sound when referring to a bottle. The listener must interpret the
meaning of the holophrase, and when this is someone who has spent time with the child,
interpretation is not too difficult. But, someone who has not been around the child will have
trouble knowing what is meant. Imagine the parent who to a friend exclaims, “Ezra’s talking all
the time now!” The friend hears only “ju da ga” to which the parent explains means, “I want
some milk when I go with Daddy.”
Language Errors: The early utterances of children contain many errors, for instance, confusing
/b/ and /d/, or /c/ and /z/. The words children create are often simplified, in part because they are
not yet able to make the more complex sounds of the real language (Dobrich & Scarborough,
1992). Children may say “keekee” for kitty, “nana” for banana, and “vesketti” for spaghetti
because it is easier. Often these early words are accompanied by gestures that may also be easier
to produce than the words themselves. Children’s pronunciations become increasingly accurate
between 1 and 3 years, but some problems may persist until school age.
A child who learns that a word stands for an object may initially think that the word can be used
for only that particular object, which is referred to as underextension. Only the family’s Irish
Setter is a “doggie”, for example. More often, however, a child may think that a label applies to
all objects that are similar to the original object, which is called overextension. For example,
all animals become “doggies”. The first error is often the result of children learning the meaning
of a word in a specific context, while the second language error is a function of the child’s
smaller vocabulary.
First words and cultural influences: If the child is using English, first words tend to be
nouns. The child labels objects such as cup, ball, or other items that they regularly interact
92

with. In a verb-friendly language such as Chinese, however, children may learn more verbs. This
may also be due to the different emphasis given to objects based on culture. Chinese children
may be taught to notice action and relationships between objects, while children from the United
States may be taught to name an object and its qualities (color, texture, size, etc.). These
differences can be seen when comparing interpretations of art by older students from China and
the United States (Imai et al., 2008).
Two-word sentences and telegraphic (text message) speech: By the time they become
toddlers, children have a vocabulary of about 50-200 words and begin putting those words
together in telegraphic speech, such as “baby bye-bye” or “doggie pretty”. Words needed to
convey messages are used, but the articles and other parts of speech necessary for grammatical
correctness are not yet used. These expressions sound like a telegraph, or perhaps a better
analogy today would be that they read like a text message. Telegraphic speech/text message
speech occurs when unnecessary words are not used. “Give baby ball” is used rather than “Give
the baby the ball.”
Infant-directed Speech: Why is a horse a “horsie”? Have you ever wondered why adults tend
to use “baby talk” or that sing-song type of intonation and exaggeration used when talking to
children? This represents a universal tendency and is known as infant-directed speech. It
involves exaggerating the vowel and consonant sounds, using a high-pitched voice, and
delivering the phrase with great facial expression (Clark, 2009). Why is this done? Infants are
frequently more attuned to the tone of voice of the person speaking than to the content of the
words themselves and are aware of the target of speech. Werker, Pegg, and McLeod (1994) found
that infants listened longer to a woman who was speaking to a baby than to a woman who was
speaking to another adult. Adults may use this form of speech in order to clearly articulate the
sounds of a word so that the child can hear the sounds involved. It may also be because when this
type of speech is used, the infant pays more attention to the speaker and this sets up a pattern of
interaction in which the speaker and listener are in tune with one another.

Theories of Language Development
Psychological theories of language learning differ in terms of the importance they place on
nature and nurture. Remember that we are a product of both nature and nurture. Researchers
now believe that language acquisition is partially inborn and partially learned through our
interactions with our linguistic environment (Gleitman & Newport, 1995; Stork & Widdowson,
1974). First to be discussed are the biological theories, including nativist, brain areas and critical
periods. Next, learning theory and social pragmatics will be presented.
Nativism: The linguist Noam Chomsky is a believer in the nature approach to language, arguing
that human brains contain a language acquisition device (LAD) that includes a universal
grammar that underlies all human language (Chomsky, 1965, 1972). According to this approach,
each of the many languages spoken around the world (there are between 6,000 and 8,000) is an
individual example of the same underlying set of procedures that are hardwired into human
brains. Chomsky’s account proposes that children are born with a knowledge of general rules of
syntax that determine how sentences are constructed. Language develops as long as the infant is

93

exposed to it. No teaching, training, or reinforcement is required for language to develop as
proposed by Skinner.
Chomsky differentiates between the deep structure of an idea; that is, how the idea is
represented in the fundamental universal grammar that is common to all languages, and the
surface structure of the idea or how it is expressed in any one language. Once we hear or
express a thought in surface structure, we generally forget exactly how it happened. At the end of
a lecture, you will remember a lot of the deep structure (i.e., the ideas expressed by the
instructor), but you cannot reproduce the surface structure (the exact words that the instructor
used to communicate the ideas).
Although there is general agreement among psychologists that babies are genetically
programmed to learn language, there is still debate about Chomsky’s idea that there is a universal
grammar that can account for all language learning. Evans and Levinson (2009) surveyed the
world’s languages and found that none of the presumed underlying features of the language
acquisition device were entirely universal. In their search they found languages that did not have
noun or verb phrases, that did not have tenses (e.g., past, present, future), and even some that did
not have nouns or verbs at all, even though a basic assumption of a universal grammar is that all
languages should share these features.
Brain Areas for Language: For the
90% of people who are right-handed,
language is stored and controlled by
the left cerebral cortex, although for
some left-handers this pattern is
reversed. These differences can easily
be seen in the results of neuroimaging
studies that show that listening to and
producing language creates greater
activity in the left hemisphere than in
the right. Broca’s area, an area in
front of the left hemisphere near the
motor cortex, is responsible for
language production (Figure 3.20).
This area was first localized in the
1860s by the French physician Paul
Broca, who studied patients with
lesions to various parts of the brain.
Wernicke’s area, an area of the brain
next to the auditory cortex, is
responsible for language comprehension.

Figure 3.20 Drawing of Brain Showing Broca’s and
Wernicke’s Areas

For most people the left hemisphere is specialized for language.
Broca’s area, near the motor cortex, is involved in language
production, whereas Wernicke’s area, near the auditory cortex, is
specialized for language comprehension.

Is there a critical period for learning language? Psychologists believe there is a critical
period, a time in which learning can easily occur, for language. This critical period appears to
be between infancy and puberty (Lenneberg, 1967; Penfield & Roberts, 1959), but isolating the
exact timeline has been elusive. Children who are not exposed to language early in their lives
94

Figure 3.21 Victor of Aveyon

will likely never grasp the grammatical and communication
nuances of language. Case studies, including Victor the
“Wild Child,” who was abandoned as a baby in 18th century
France and not discovered until he was 12, and Genie, a
child whose parents kept her locked away from 18 months
until 13 years of age, are two examples of children who
were deprived of language. Both children made some
progress in socialization after they were rescued, but neither
of them ever developed a working understanding of
language (Rymer, 1993). Yet, such case studies are fraught
with many confounds. How much did the years of social
isolation and malnutrition contribute to their problems in
language development?

A better test for the notion of critical periods for language is
found in studies of children with hearing loss. Several
studies show that the earlier children are diagnosed with
hearing impairment and receive treatment, the better the child’s long-term language
development. For instance, Stika et al. (2015) reported that when children’s hearing loss was
identified during newborn screening, and subsequently addressed, the majority showed normal
language development when later tested at 12-18 months. Fitzpatrick, Crawford, Ni, and
Durieux-Smith (2011) reported that early language intervention in children who were
moderately to severely hard of hearing, demonstrated normal outcomes in language proficiency
by 4 to 5 years of age. Tomblin et al. (2015) reported that children who were fit with hearing
aids by 6 months of age showed good levels of language development by age 2. Those whose
hearing was not corrected until after 18 months showed lower language performance, even in
the early preschool years. However, this study did reveal that those whose hearing was
corrected by toddlerhood had greatly improved language skills by age 6. The research with
hearing impaired children reveals that this critical period for language development is not
exclusive to infancy, and that the brain is still receptive to language development in early
childhood. Fortunately, it is has become routine to screen hearing in newborns, because when
hearing loss is not treated early, it can delay spoken language, literacy, and impact children’s
social skills (Moeller & Tomblin, 2015).

Learning Theory: Perhaps the most straightforward explanation of language development is
that it occurs through the principles of learning, including association and reinforcement
(Skinner, 1953). Additionally, Bandura (1977) described the importance of observation and
imitation of others in learning language. There must be at least some truth to the idea that
language is learned through environmental interactions or nurture. Children learn the language
that they hear spoken around them rather than some other language. Also supporting this idea is
the gradual improvement of language skills with time. It seems that children modify their
language through imitation and reinforcement, such as parental praise and being understood. For
example, when a two-year-old child asks for juice, he might say, “me juice,” to which his
mother might respond by giving him a cup of apple juice.

However, language cannot be entirely learned. For one, children learn words too fast for them to
be learned through reinforcement. Between the ages of 18 months and 5 years, children learn up
to 10 new words every day (Anglin, 1993). More importantly, language is more generative than
it is imitative. Language is not a predefined set of ideas and sentences that we choose when we
need them, but rather a system of rules and procedures that allows us to create an infinite number
of statements, thoughts, and ideas, including those that have never previously occurred. When a
child says that she “swimmed” in the pool, for instance, she is showing generativity. No adult
speaker of English would ever say “swimmed,” yet it is easily generated from the normal system
of producing language.
Other evidence that refutes the idea that all language is learned through experience comes from
the observation that children may learn languages better than they ever hear them. Deaf children
whose parents do not communicate using ASL very well nevertheless are able to learn it perfectly
on their own and may even make up their own language if they need to (Goldin-Meadow &
Mylander, 1998). A group of deaf children in a school in Nicaragua, whose teachers could not
sign, invented a way to communicate through made-up signs (Senghas, Senghas, & Pyers, 2005).
The development of this new Nicaraguan Sign Language has continued and changed as new
generations of students have come to the school and started using the language. Although the
original system was not a real language, it is becoming closer and closer every year, showing the
development of a new language in modern times.
Social pragmatics: Another view emphasizes the very social nature of human language.
Language from this view is not only a cognitive skill, but also a social one. Language is a tool
humans use to communicate, connect to, influence, and inform others. Most of all, language
comes out of a need to cooperate. The social nature of language has been demonstrated by a
number of studies that have shown that children use several pre-linguistic skills (such as pointing
and other gestures) to communicate not only their own needs, but what others may need. So, a
child watching her mother search for an object may point to the object to help her mother find it.
Eighteen-month to 30-month-olds have been shown to make linguistic repairs when it is clear
96

that another person does not understand them (Grosse, Behne, Carpenter & Tomasello, 2010).
Grosse et al. (2010) found that even when the child was given the desired object, if there had
been any misunderstanding along the way (such as a delay in being handed the object, or the
experimenter calling the object by the wrong name), children would make linguistic repairs.
This would suggest that children are using language not only as a means of achieving some
material goal, but to make themselves understood in the mind of another person.

Temperament
Perhaps you have spent time with a number of infants. How were they alike? How did they
differ? How do you compare with your siblings or other children you have known well? You
may have noticed that some seemed to be in a better mood than others and that some were more
sensitive to noise or more easily distracted than others. These differences may be attributed to
temperament. Temperament is the innate characteristics of the infant, including mood, activity
level, and emotional reactivity, noticeable soon after birth.
In a 1956 landmark study, Chess and Thomas (1996) evaluated 141 children’s temperament
based on parental interviews. Referred to as the New York Longitudinal Study, infants were
assessed on 9 dimensions of temperament including: Activity level, rhythmicity (regularity of
biological functions), approach/withdrawal (how children deal with new things), adaptability to
situations, intensity of reactions, threshold of responsiveness (how intense a stimulus has to be
for the child to react), quality of mood, distractibility, attention span, and persistence. Based on
the infants’ behavioral profiles, they were categorized into three general types of temperament:
•
•
•

Easy Child (40%) who is able to quickly adapt to routine and new situations, remains
calm, is easy to soothe, and usually is in a positive mood.
Difficult Child (10%) who reacts negatively to new situations, has trouble adapting to
routine, is usually negative in mood, and cries frequently.
Slow-to-Warm-Up Child (15%) has a low activity level, adjusts slowly to new
situations and is often negative in mood.

As can be seen the percentages do not equal 100% as some children were not able to be placed
neatly into one of the categories. Think about how you might approach each type of child in
order to improve your interactions with them. An easy child will not need much extra attention,
while a slow to warm up child may need to be given advance warning if new people or situations
are going to be introduced. A difficult child may need to be given extra time to burn off their
97

energy. A caregiver's ability to work well and accurately read the child will enjoy a goodnessof-fit, meaning their styles match and communication and interaction can flow. Parents who
recognize each child’s temperament and accept it, will nurture more effective interactions with
the child and encourage more adaptive functioning. For example, an adventurous child whose
parents regularly take her outside on hikes would provide a good “fit” to her temperament.
Parenting is bidirectional: Not only do parents
Figure 3.23
affect their children, children influence their
parents. Child characteristics, such as
temperament, affect parenting behaviors and
roles. For example, an infant with an easy
temperament may enable parents to feel more
effective, as they are easily able to soothe the
child and elicit smiling and cooing. On the other
hand, a cranky or fussy infant elicits fewer
positive reactions from his or her parents and may
result in parents feeling less effective in the
parenting role (Eisenberg et al., 2008). Over
Source
time, parents of more difficult children may
become more punitive and less patient with their
children (Clark, Kochanska, & Ready, 2000; Eisenberg et al., 1999; Kiff, Lengua, & Zalewski,
2011). Parents who have a fussy, difficult child are less satisfied with their marriages and have
greater challenges in balancing work and family roles (Hyde, Else-Quest, & Goldsmith, 2004).
Thus, child temperament is one of the child characteristics that influences how parents behave
with their children.
Temperament does not change dramatically as we grow up, but we may learn how to work
around and manage our temperamental qualities. Temperament may be one of the things about
us that stays the same throughout development. In contrast, personality, defined as an
individual’s consistent pattern of feeling, thinking, and behaving, is the result of the continuous
interplay between biological disposition and experience.
Personality also develops from temperament in other ways (Thompson, Winer, & Goodvin,
2010). As children mature biologically, temperamental characteristics emerge and change over
time. A newborn is not capable of much self-control, but as brain-based capacities for selfcontrol advance, temperamental changes in self-regulation become more apparent. For example,
a newborn who cries frequently does not necessarily have a grumpy personality; over time, with
sufficient parental support and increased sense of security, the child might be less likely to cry.
In addition, personality is made up of many other features besides temperament. Children’s
developing self-concept, their motivations to achieve or to socialize, their values and goals, their
coping styles, their sense of responsibility and conscientiousness, and many other qualities are
encompassed into personality. These qualities are influenced by biological dispositions, but even
more by the child’s experiences with others, particularly in close relationships, that guide the
growth of individual characteristics. Indeed, personality development begins with the biological
foundations of temperament but becomes increasingly elaborated, extended, and refined over
98

time. The newborn that parents gazed upon becomes an adult with a personality of depth and
nuance.

Infant Emotions
At birth, infants exhibit two emotional responses: Attraction and withdrawal. They show
attraction to pleasant situations that bring comfort, stimulation, and pleasure, and they withdraw
from unpleasant stimulation such as bitter flavors or physical discomfort. At around two months,
infants exhibit social engagement in the form of social smiling as they respond with smiles to
those who engage their positive attention (Lavelli & Fogel, 2005).
Figure 3.24

Source

Social smiling becomes more stable and organized as infants learn
to use their smiles to engage their parents in interactions. Pleasure is
expressed as laughter at 3 to 5 months of age, and displeasure
becomes more specific as fear, sadness, or anger between ages 6 and
8 months. Anger is often the reaction to being prevented from
obtaining a goal, such as a toy being removed (Braungart-Rieker,
Hill-Soderlund, & Karrass, 2010). In contrast, sadness is typically
the response when infants are deprived of a caregiver (Papousek,
2007). Fear is often associated with the presence of a stranger,
known as stranger wariness, or the departure of significant others
known as separation anxiety. Both appear sometime between 6
and 15 months after object permanence has been acquired. Further,
there is some indication that infants may experience jealousy as
young as 6 months of age (Hart & Carrington, 2002).

Emotions are often divided into two general categories: Basic emotions, such as interest,
happiness, anger, fear, surprise, sadness and disgust, which appear first, and self-conscious
emotions, such as envy, pride, shame, guilt, doubt, and embarrassment. Unlike primary
emotions, secondary emotions appear as children start to develop a self-concept and require
social instruction on when to feel such emotions. The situations in which children learn selfconscious emotions varies from culture to culture. Individualistic cultures teach us to feel pride
in personal accomplishments, while in more collective cultures children are taught to not call
attention to themselves, unless you wish to feel embarrassed for doing so (Akimoto &
Sanbinmatsu, 1999).
Facial expressions of emotion are important regulators of social interaction. In the developmental
literature, this has been investigated under the concept of social referencing; that is, the process
whereby infants seek out information from others to clarify a situation and then use that
information to act (Klinnert, Campos, & Sorce, 1983). To date, the strongest demonstration of
social referencing comes from work on the visual cliff. In the first study to investigate this
concept, Sorce, Emde, Campos, and Klinnert (1985) placed mothers on the far end of the “cliff”
from the infant. Mothers first smiled to the infants and placed a toy on top of the safety glass to
attract them; infants invariably began crawling to their mothers. When the infants were in the
center of the table, however, the mother then posed an expression of fear, sadness, anger,
interest, or joy. The results were clearly different for the different faces; no infant crossed the
99

table when the mother showed fear; only 6% did when the mother posed anger, 33% crossed
when the mother posed sadness, and approximately 75% of the infants crossed when the mother
posed joy or interest.
Other studies provide similar support for facial expressions as regulators of social interaction.
Experimenters posed facial expressions of neutral, anger, or disgust toward babies as they moved
toward an object and measured the amount of inhibition the babies showed in touching the object
(Bradshaw, 1986). The results for 10- and 15-month olds were the same: Anger produced the
greatest inhibition, followed by disgust, with neutral the least. This study was later replicated
using joy and disgust expressions, altering the method so that the infants were not allowed to
touch the toy (compared with a distractor object) until one hour after exposure to the expression
(Hertenstein & Campos, 2004). At 14 months of age, significantly more infants touched the toy
when they saw joyful expressions, but fewer touched the toy when the infants saw disgust.
A final emotional change is in self-regulation. Emotional self-regulation refers to strategies we
use to control our emotional states so that we can attain goals (Thompson & Goodvin, 2007).
This requires effortful control of emotions and initially requires assistance from caregivers
(Rothbart, Posner, & Kieras, 2006). Young infants have very limited capacity to adjust their
emotional states and depend on their caregivers to help soothe themselves. Caregivers can offer
distractions to redirect the infant’s attention and comfort to reduce the emotional distress. As
areas of the infant’s prefrontal cortex continue to develop, infants can tolerate more stimulation.
By 4 to 6 months, babies can begin to shift their attention away from upsetting stimuli (Rothbart
et al, 2006). Older infants and toddlers can more effectively communicate their need for help
and can crawl or walk toward or away from various situations (Cole, Armstrong, & Pemberton,
2010). This aids in their ability to self-regulate. Temperament also plays a role in children’s
ability to control their emotional states, and individual differences have been noted in the
emotional self-regulation of infants and toddlers (Rothbart & Bates, 2006).
Development of sense of self: During the second year of life,
children begin to recognize themselves as they gain a sense of
self as object. In a classic experiment by Lewis and Brooks
(1978) children 9 to 24 months of age were placed in front of a
mirror after a spot of rouge was placed on their nose as their
mothers pretended to wipe something off the child’s face. If
the child reacted by touching his or her own nose rather that of
the “baby” in the mirror, it was taken to suggest that the child
recognized the reflection as him- or herself. Lewis and Brooks
found that somewhere between 15 and 24 months most infants
developed a sense of self-awareness. Self-awareness is the
realization that you are separate from others (Kopp, 2011).
Once a child has achieved self-awareness, the child is moving
toward understanding social emotions such as guilt, shame or
embarrassment, as well as, sympathy or empathy.

Forming Attachments
Figure: 3.26 Mutually enjoyable
interactions promote infant bonding

Attachment is the close bond with a caregiver
from which the infant derives a sense of
security. The formation of attachments in infancy
has been the subject of considerable research as
attachments have been viewed as foundations for
future relationships. Additionally, attachments
form the basis for confidence and curiosity as
toddlers, and as important influences on selfconcept.

Freud’s Psychoanalytic Theory: According to
Freud (1938) infants are oral creatures who obtain
(credit: Peter Shanks)
pleasure from sucking and mouthing objects.
Freud believed the infant will become attached to
a person or object that provides this pleasure. Consequently, infants were believed to become
attached to their mother because she was the one who satisfied their oral needs and provided
pleasure. Freud further believed that the infants will become attached to their mothers “if the
mother is relaxed and generous in her feeding practices, thereby allowing the child a lot of oral
pleasure,” (Shaffer, 1985, p. 435). Was Freud correct in his explanation for why infants became
attached?
Harlow’s Research: In one classic study showing if nursing was the most important factor to
attachment, Wisconsin University psychologists Harry and Margaret Harlow investigated the
responses of young monkeys. The infants were separated from their biological mothers, and two
surrogate mothers were introduced to their cages. One, the wire mother, consisted of a round
wooden head, a mesh of cold metal wires, and a bottle of milk from which the baby monkey
could drink. The second mother was a foam-rubber form wrapped in a heated terry-cloth blanket.
The infant monkeys went to the wire mother for food, but they overwhelmingly preferred and
spent significantly more time with the warm terry-cloth mother. The warm terry-cloth mother
provided no food but did provide comfort (Harlow, 1958). The infant's need for physical
closeness and touching is referred to as contact comfort. Contact comfort is believed to be the
foundation for attachment. The Harlows’ studies confirmed that babies have social as well as
physical needs. Both monkeys and human babies need a secure base that allows them to feel safe.
From this base, they can gain the confidence they need to venture out and explore their worlds.
Bowlby’s Theory: Building on the work of Harlow and others, John Bowlby developed the
concept of attachment theory. He defined attachment as the affectional bond or tie that an
infant forms with the mother (Bowlby, 1969). An infant must form this bond with a primary
caregiver in order to have normal social and emotional development. In addition, Bowlby
proposed that this attachment bond is very powerful and continues throughout life. He used
the concept of secure base to define a healthy attachment between parent and child (Bowlby,
1982). A secure base is a parental presence that gives the child a sense of safety as the child
explores the surroundings.

101

Figure 3.27 John Bowlby

Source

Bowlby said that two things are needed for a healthy
attachment: The caregiver must be responsive to the child’s
physical, social, and emotional needs; and the caregiver and
child must engage in mutually enjoyable interactions
(Bowlby, 1969). Additionally, Bowlby observed that infants
would go to extraordinary lengths to prevent separation
from their parents, such as crying, refusing to be comforted,
and waiting for the caregiver to return. He observed that
these same expressions were common to many other
mammals, and consequently argued that these negative
responses to separation serve an evolutionary function.
Because mammalian infants cannot feed or protect
themselves, they are dependent upon the care and protection
of adults for survival. Thus, those infants who were able to
maintain proximity to an attachment figure were more likely
to survive and reproduce.

Erikson: Trust vs. Mistrust
As previously discussed in chapter 1, Erikson formulated an eight stage theory of psychosocial
development. Erikson was in agreement on the importance of a secure base, arguing that the
most important goal of infancy was the development of a basic sense of trust in one’s caregivers.
Consequently, the first stage, trust vs. mistrust, highlights the importance of attachment. Erikson
maintained that the first year to year and a half of life involves the establishment of a sense of
trust (Erikson, 1982). Infants are dependent and must rely on others to meet their basic physical
needs as well as their needs for stimulation and comfort. A caregiver who consistently meets
these needs instills a sense of trust or the belief that the world is a trustworthy place. The
caregiver should not worry about overly indulging a child’s need for comfort, contact or
stimulation.
Problems establishing trust: Erikson (1982) believed that mistrust could contaminate all
aspects of one’s life and deprive the individual of love and fellowship with others. Consider the
implications for establishing trust if a caregiver is unavailable or is upset and ill-prepared to care
for a child. Or if a child is born prematurely, is unwanted, or has physical problems that make
him or her less desirable to a parent. Under these circumstances, we cannot assume that the
parent is going to provide the child with a feeling of trust.

Mary Ainsworth and the Strange Situation Technique
Developmental psychologist Mary Ainsworth, a student of John Bowlby, continued studying the
development of attachment in infants. Ainsworth and her colleagues created a laboratory test that
measured an infant’s attachment to his or her parent. The test is called The Strange Situation
Technique because it is conducted in a context that is unfamiliar to the child and therefore likely
to heighten the child’s need for his or her parent (Ainsworth, 1979).

102

During the procedure, that lasts about 20 minutes, the parent and the infant are first left alone,
while the infant explores the room full of toys. Then a strange adult enters the room and talks for
a minute to the parent, after which the parent leaves the room. The stranger stays with the infant
for a few minutes, and then the parent again enters, and the stranger leaves the room. During the
entire session, a video camera records the child’s behaviors, which are later coded by trained
coders. The investigators were especially interested in how the child responded to the caregiver
leaving and returning to the room, referred to as the “reunion.” On the basis of their behaviors,
the children are categorized into one of four groups where each group reflects a different kind of
attachment relationship with the caregiver. One style is secure and the other three styles are
referred to as insecure.
•

A child with a secure attachment style usually explores freely while the caregiver is
present and may engage with the stranger. The child will typically play with the toys and
bring one to the caregiver to show and describe from time to time. The child may be upset
when the caregiver departs but is also happy to see the caregiver return.

•

A child with an ambivalent (sometimes called resistant) attachment style is wary about
the situation in general, particularly the stranger, and stays close or even clings to the
caregiver rather than exploring the toys. When the caregiver leaves, the child is extremely
distressed and is ambivalent when the caregiver returns. The child may rush to the
caregiver, but then fails to be comforted when picked up. The child may still be angry
and even resist attempts to be soothed.

•

A child with an avoidant attachment style will avoid or ignore the mother, showing
little emotion when the mother departs or returns. The child may run away from the
mother when she approaches. The child will not explore very much, regardless of who is
there, and the stranger will not be treated much differently from the mother.

•

A child with a disorganized/disoriented attachment style seems to have an inconsistent
way of coping with the stress of the strange situation. The child may cry during the
separation, but avoid the mother when she returns, or the child may approach the mother
but then freeze or fall to the floor.

How common are the attachment styles among children in the United States? It is estimated that
about 65 percent of children in the United States are securely attached. Twenty percent exhibit
avoidant styles and 10 to 15 percent are ambivalent. Another 5 to 10 percent may be
characterized as disorganized (Ainsworth, Blehar, Waters, & Wall, 1978).

103

Some cultural differences in attachment
styles have been found (Rothbaum, Weisz,
Pott, Miyake, & Morelli, 2010). For
example, German parents value
independence and Japanese mothers are
typically by their children’s sides. As a
result, the rate of insecure-avoidant
attachments is higher in Germany and
insecure-resistant attachments are higher in
Japan. These differences reflect cultural
variation rather than true insecurity,
however (van Ijzendoorn and Sagi,
1999). Overall, secure attachment is the
most common type of attachment seen in

Figure 3.28

every culture studied thus far (Thompson, 2006).
Caregiver Interactions and the Formation of Attachment: Most developmental psychologists
argue that a child becomes securely attached when there is consistent contact from one or more
caregivers who meet the physical and emotional needs of the child in a responsive and
appropriate manner. However, even in cultures where mothers do not talk, cuddle, and play with
their infants, secure attachments can develop (LeVine et. al., 1994).
The insecure ambivalent style occurs when the parent is insensitive and responds inconsistently
to the child’s needs. Consequently, the infant is never sure that the world is a trustworthy place
or that he or she can rely on others without some anxiety. A caregiver who is unavailable,
perhaps because of marital tension, substance abuse, or preoccupation with work, may send a
message to the infant he or she cannot rely on having needs met. An infant who receives only
sporadic attention when experiencing discomfort may not learn how to calm down. The child
may cry if separated from the caregiver and also cry upon their return. They seek constant
reassurance that never seems to satisfy their doubt. Keep in mind that clingy behavior can also
just be part of a child’s natural disposition or temperament and does not necessarily reflect some
kind of parental neglect. Additionally, a caregiver that attends to a child’s frustration can help
teach them to be calm and to relax.
The insecure avoidant style is marked by insecurity, but this style is also characterized by a
tendency to avoid contact with the caregiver and with others. This child may have learned that
needs typically go unmet and learns that the caregiver does not provide care and cannot be relied
upon for comfort, even sporadically. An insecure avoidant child learns to be more independent
and disengaged.
The insecure disorganized/disoriented style represents the most insecure style of attachment
and occurs when the child is given mixed, confused, and inappropriate responses from the
caregiver. For example, a mother who suffers from schizophrenia may laugh when a child is
hurting or cry when a child exhibits joy. The child does not learn how to interpret emotions or to
connect with the unpredictable caregiver. This type of attachment is also often seen in children

104

who have been abused. Research has shown that abuse disrupts a child’s ability to regulate their
emotions (Main & Solomon, 1990).
Caregiver Consistency: Having a consistent
caregiver may be jeopardized if the infant is
cared for in a day care setting with a high
turn-over of staff or if institutionalized and
given little more than basic physical
care. Infants who, perhaps because of being
in orphanages with inadequate care, have not
had the opportunity to attach in infancy may
still form initial secure attachments several
years later. However, they may have more
emotional problems of depression, anger, or
be overly friendly as they interact with others
(O’Connor et. al., 2003).

Social Deprivation: Severe deprivation of parental attachment can lead to serious problems.
According to studies of children who have not been given warm, nurturing care, they may show
developmental delays, failure to thrive, and attachment disorders (Bowlby, 1982). Non-organic
failure to thrive is the diagnosis for an infant who does not grow, develop, or gain weight on
schedule and there is no known medical explanation for this failure. Poverty, neglect,
inconsistent parenting, and severe family dysfunction are correlated with non-organic failure to
thrive. In addition, postpartum depression can cause even a well-intentioned mother to neglect
her infant.
Reactive Attachment Disorder: Children who experience social neglect or deprivation,
repeatedly change primary caregivers that limit opportunities to form stable attachments or are
reared in unusual settings (such as institutions) that limit opportunities to form stable attachments
can certainly have difficulty forming attachments. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (American Psychiatric Association, 2013), those
children experiencing neglectful situations and also displaying markedly disturbed and
developmentally inappropriate attachment behavior, such as being inhibited and withdrawn,
minimal social and emotional responsiveness to others, and limited positive affect, may be
diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder. This disorder often occurs with developmental
delays, especially in cognitive and language areas. Fortunately, the majority of severely
neglected children do not develop reactive attachment disorder, which occurs in less than 10% of
such children. The quality of the caregiving environment after serious neglect affects the
development of this disorder.
Resiliency: Being able to overcome challenges and successfully adapt is resiliency. Even young
children can exhibit strong resiliency to harsh circumstances. Resiliency can be attributed to
certain personality factors, such as an easy-going temperament. Some children are warm,
friendly, and responsive, whereas others tend to be more irritable, less manageable, and difficult
to console, and these differences play a role in attachment (Gillath, Shaver, Baek, & Chun, 2008;
Seifer, Schiller, Sameroff, Resnick, & Riordan, 1996). It seems safe to say that attachment, like
105

most other developmental processes, is affected by an interplay of genetic and socialization
influences.
Receiving support from others also leads to resiliency. A positive and strong support group can
help a parent and child build a strong foundation by offering assistance and positive attitudes
toward the newborn and parent. In a direct test of this idea, Dutch researcher van den Boom
(1994) randomly assigned some babies’ mothers to a training session in which they learned to
better respond to their children’s needs. The research found that these mothers’ babies were
more likely to show a secure attachment style in comparison to the mothers in a control group
that did not receive training.

Erikson: Autonomy vs. Shame and Doubt
As the child begins to walk and talk, an interest in independence or autonomy replaces a concern
for trust. The toddler tests the limits of what can be touched, said, and explored. Erikson (1982)
believed that toddlers should be allowed to explore their environment as freely as safety allows
and in so doing will develop a sense of independence that will later grow to self-esteem,
initiative, and overall confidence. If a caregiver is overly anxious about the toddler’s actions for
fear that the child will get hurt or violate other’s expectation, the caregiver can give the child the
message that he or she should be ashamed of their behavior and instill a sense of doubt in their
own abilities. Parenting advice based on these ideas would be to keep toddlers safe but let them
learn by doing.

Measuring Infant Development
The Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition (Bayley-III)
comprehensively assess children within the age range of 1 to 42 months (Pearson Education,
2016). Children are evaluated in five key developmental domains, including cognition,
language, social-emotional, motor, and adaptive behavior. By identifying developmental delays
in the very young, the Bayley Scales can highlight which early intervention techniques might be
most beneficial. Detailed information is even able to be obtained from non-verbal children.

Chapter 4: Early Childhood
Our discussion will now focus on the physical, cognitive and socioemotional development
during the ages from two to six, referred to as early childhood. Early childhood represents a time
period of continued rapid growth, especially in the areas of language and cognitive development.
Those in early childhood have more control over their emotions and begin to pursue a variety of
activities that reflect their personal interests. Parents continue to be very important in the child’s
development, but now teachers and peers exert an influence not seen with infants and toddlers.

Overall Physical Growth: Children between the ages
of two and six years tend to grow about 3 inches in
height and gain about 4 to 5 pounds in weight each
year. Just as in infancy, growth occurs in spurts rather
than continually. According to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (2000) the average 2-year-old
weighs between 23 and 28 pounds and stands between
33 and 35 inches tall. The average 6-year-old weighs
between 40 and 50 pounds and is about 44 to 47 inches
in height. The 3-year-old is still very similar to a
toddler with a large head, large stomach, short arms and
legs. By the time the child reaches age 6, however, the
torso has lengthened, and body proportions have
become more like those of adults.

Figure 4.1

This growth rate is slower than that of infancy and is
accompanied by a reduced appetite between the ages of
2 and 6. This change can sometimes be surprising to
parents and lead to the development of poor eating
Source
habits. However, children between the ages of 2 and 3
need 1,000 to 1,400 calories, while children between
the ages of 4 and 8 need 1,200 to 2,000 calories (Mayo Clinic, 2016a).

115

Brain Maturation
Brain weight: The brain is about 75 percent its adult weight by three years of age. By age 6, it is
at 95 percent its adult weight (Lenroot & Giedd, 2006). Myelination and the development of
dendrites continue to occur in the cortex and as it does, we see a corresponding change in what
the child is capable of doing. Greater development in the prefrontal cortex, the area of the brain
behind the forehead that helps us to think, strategize, and control attention and emotion, makes it
increasingly possible to inhibit emotional outbursts and understand how to play games.
Understanding the game, thinking ahead, and coordinating movement improve with practice and
myelination.
Growth in the Hemispheres and
Corpus Callosum: Between ages
3 and 6, the left hemisphere of the
brain grows dramatically. This
side of the brain or hemisphere is
typically involved in language
skills. The right hemisphere
continues to grow throughout
early childhood and is involved in
tasks that require spatial skills,
such as recognizing shapes and
patterns. The corpus callosum, a
dense band of fibers that connects
the two hemispheres of the brain,
contains approximately 200
million nerve fibers that connect
the hemispheres (Kolb &
Whishaw, 2011). The corpus
callosum is illustrated in Figure
4.2.

Figure 4.2 Corpus Callosum

Source

The corpus callosum is located a couple of inches below the longitudinal fissure, which runs the
length of the brain and separates the two cerebral hemispheres (Garrett, 2015). Because the two
hemispheres carry out different functions, they communicate with each other and integrate their
activities through the corpus callosum. Additionally, because incoming information is directed
toward one hemisphere, such as visual information from the left eye being directed to the right
hemisphere, the corpus callosum shares this information with the other hemisphere.
The corpus callosum undergoes a growth spurt between ages 3 and 6, and this results in
improved coordination between right and left hemisphere tasks. For example, in comparison to
other individuals, children younger than 6 demonstrate difficulty coordinating an Etch A Sketch
toy because their corpus callosum is not developed enough to integrate the movements of both
hands (Kalat, 2016).

116

Motor Skill Development
Early childhood is the time period when most children acquire the
Figure 4.3
basic skills for locomotion, such as running, jumping, and
skipping, and object control skills, such as throwing, catching, and
kicking (Clark, 1994). Children continue to improve their gross
motor skills as they run and jump. Fine motor skills are also being
refined in activities, such as pouring water into a container,
drawing, coloring, and buttoning coats and using scissors. Table
4.1 highlights some of the changes in motor skills during early
childhood between 2 and 5 years of age. The development of
greater coordination of muscles groups and finer precision can be
seen during this time period. Thus, average 2-year-olds may be
able to run with slightly better coordination than they managed as
a toddler, yet they would have difficulty peddling a tricycle,
something the typical 3-year-old can do. We see similar changes in
fine motor skills with 4-year-olds who no longer struggle to put on
Source
their clothes, something they may have had problems with two
years earlier. Motor skills continue to develop into middle
childhood, but for those in early childhood, play that deliberately involves these skills is
emphasized.
Children’s Art: Children’s art highlights many developmental changes. Kellogg (1969) noted
that children’s drawings underwent several transformations. Starting with about 20 different
types of scribbles at age 2, children move on to experimenting with the placement of scribbles on
the page. By age 3 they are using the basic structure of scribbles to create shapes and are
beginning to combine these shapes to create more complex images. By 4 or 5 children are
creating images that are more recognizable representations of the world. These changes are a
function of improvement in motor skills, perceptual development, and cognitive understanding
of the world (Cote & Golbeck, 2007).
The drawing of tadpoles (see Figure: 4.4) is a pervasive
Figure 4.4
feature of young children’s drawings of self and others.
Tadpoles emerge in children’s drawing at about the age
of 3 and have been observed in the drawings of young
children around the world (Gernhardt, Rubeling & Keller,
2015), but there are cultural variations in the size, number
of facial features, and emotional expressions displayed.
Gernhardt et al. found that children from Western
contexts (i.e., urban areas of Germany and Sweden) and
urban educated non-Western contexts (i.e., urban areas of
Source
Turkey, Costa Rica and Estonia) drew larger images,
with more facial detail and more positive emotional
expressions, while those from non-Western rural contexts (i.e., rural areas of Cameroon and
India) depicted themselves as smaller, with less facial details and a more neutral emotional
expression. The authors suggest that cultural norms of non-Western traditionally rural cultures,
117

which emphasize the social group rather than the individual, may be one of the factors for the
smaller size of the figures compared to the larger figures from children in the Western cultures
which emphasize the individual.

Toilet Training
Figure: 4.5

Source

Toilet training typically occurs during the first two years of early
childhood (24-36 months). Some children show interest by age 2,
but others may not be ready until months later. The average age for
girls to be toilet trained is 29 months and for boys it is 31 months,
and 98% of children are trained by 36 months (Boyse & Fitzgerald,
2010). The child’s age is not as important as his/her physical and
emotional readiness. If started too early, it might take longer to train
a child. If a child resists being trained, or it is not successful after a
few weeks, it is best to take a break and try again later. Most
children master daytime bladder control first, typically within two to
three months of consistent toilet training. However, nap and
nighttime training might take months or even years.

According to the Mayo Clinic (2016b) the following questions can help parents determine if a
child is ready for toilet training:
• Does your child seem interested in the potty chair or toilet, or in wearing underwear?
• Can your child understand and follow basic directions?
• Does your child complain about wet or dirty diapers?
• Does your child tell you through words, facial expressions or posture when he or she
needs to go?
• Does your child stay dry for periods of two hours or longer during the day?
• Can your child pull down his or her pants and pull them up again?
• Can your child sit on and rise from a potty chair? (p. 1)
Some children experience elimination disorders that may require intervention by the child’s
pediatrician or a trained mental health practitioner. Elimination disorders include: enuresis, or
the repeated voiding of urine into bed or clothes (involuntary or intentional) and encopresis, the
repeated passage of feces into inappropriate places (involuntary or intentional) (American
Psychiatric Association, 2013). The prevalence of enuresis is 5%-10% for 5-year-olds, 3%-5%
for 10-year-olds and approximately 1% for those 15 years of age or older. Around 1% of 5-yearolds have encopresis, and it is more common in males than females.

Sleep
During early childhood, there is wide variation in the number of hours of sleep recommended per
day. For example, two-year-olds may still need 15-16 hours per day, while a six-year-old may
only need 7-8 hours. The National Sleep Foundation’s 2015 recommendations based on age are
listed in Figure 4.6.

119

Figure 4.6

Sexual Development in Early Childhood
Historically, children have been thought of as innocent or incapable of sexual arousal (Aries,
1962). Yet, the physical dimension of sexual arousal is present from birth. However, to associate
the elements of seduction, power, love, or lust that is part of the adult meanings of sexuality
would be inappropriate. Sexuality begins in childhood as a response to physical states and
sensation and cannot be interpreted as similar to that of adults in any way (Carroll, 2007).
Infancy: Boys and girls are capable of erections and vaginal lubrication even before birth
(Martinson, 1981). Arousal can signal overall physical contentment and stimulation that
accompanies feeding or warmth. Infants begin to explore their bodies and touch their genitals as
soon as they have the sufficient motor skills. This stimulation is for comfort or to relieve tension
rather than to reach orgasm (Carroll, 2007).
Early Childhood: Self-stimulation is common in early childhood for both boys and
girls. Curiosity about the body and about others’ bodies is a natural part of early childhood as
well. As children grow, they are more likely to show their genitals to siblings or peers, and to
take off their clothes and touch each other (Okami, Olmstead, & Abramson, 1997). Masturbation
is common for both boys and girls. Boys are often shown by other boys how to masturbate, but
girls tend to find out accidentally. Additionally, boys masturbate more often and touch
themselves more openly than do girls (Schwartz, 1999).
120

Hopefully, parents respond to this without undue alarm and without making the child feel guilty
about their bodies. Instead, messages about what is going on and the appropriate time and place
for such activities help the child learn what is appropriate.

Nutritional Concerns
In addition to those in early childhood having a smaller appetite, their parents may notice a
general reticence to try new foods, or a preference for certain foods, often served or eaten in a
particular way. Some of these changes can be traced back to the “just right” (or just-so)
phenomenon that is common in early childhood. Many young children desire consistency and
may be upset if there are even slight changes to their daily routines. They may like to line up
their toys or other objects or place them in symmetric patterns. They may arrange the objects
until they feel “just right”. Many young children have a set bedtime ritual and a strong
preference for certain clothes, toys or games. All these tendencies tend to wane as children
approach middle childhood, and the familiarity of such ritualistic behaviors seem to bring a sense
of security and general reduction in childhood fears and anxiety (Evans, Gray, & Leckman,
1999; Evans & Leckman, 2015).
Malnutrition due to insufficient food is not
common in developed nations, like the
United States, yet many children lack a
balanced diet. Added sugars and solid fats
contribute to 40% of daily calories for
children and teens in the US. Approximately
half of these empty calories come from six
sources: soda, fruit drinks, dairy desserts,
grain desserts, pizza, and whole milk (CDC,
2015). Caregivers need to keep in mind that
they are setting up taste preferences at this
age. Young children who grow accustomed
to high fat, very sweet and salty flavors may
have trouble eating foods that have subtler
Source
flavors, such as fruits and
vegetables. Consider the following advice
(See Box 4.1) about establishing eating patterns for years to come (Rice, 1997). Notice that
keeping mealtime pleasant, providing sound nutrition and not engaging in power struggles over
food are the main goals:
Figure 4.7 Nutritious Lunch

121

Box 4.1

Tips for Establishing Healthy Eating Patterns
2. Recognize that appetite varies. Children may eat well at one meal and have no appetite at
another. Rather than seeing this as a problem, it may help to realize that appetites do
vary. Continue to provide good nutrition, but do not worry excessively if the child does not
eat at a particular meal.
3. Keep it pleasant. This tip is designed to help caregivers create a positive atmosphere during
mealtime. Mealtimes should not be the time for arguments or expressing tensions. You do not
want the child to have painful memories of mealtimes together or have nervous stomachs and
problems eating and digesting food due to stress.
4. No short order chefs. While it is fine to prepare foods that children enjoy, preparing a
different meal for each child or family member sets up an unrealistic expectation from
others. Children probably do best when they are hungry, and a meal is ready. Limiting snacks
rather than allowing children to “graze” can help create an appetite for what is being served.
5. Limit choices. If you give your young child choices, make sure that you give them one or
two specific choices rather than asking “What would you like for lunch?” If given an open
choice, children may change their minds or ask for something that is not available or
appropriate.
6. Serve balanced meals. This tip encourages caregivers to serve balanced meals. A box of
macaroni and cheese is not a balanced meal. Meals prepared at home tend to have better
nutritional value than fast food or frozen dinners. Prepared foods tend to be higher in fat and
sugar content, as these ingredients enhance taste and profit margin because fresh food is often
costlier and less profitable. However, preparing fresh food at home is not costly. It does,
however, require more activity. Preparing meals and including the children in kitchen chores
can provide a fun and memorable experience.
Do not bribe. Bribing a child to eat vegetables by promising desert is not a good idea. The
child will likely find a way to get the desert without eating the vegetables (by whining or
fidgeting, perhaps, until the caregiver gives in). In addition, bribery teaches the child that
some foods are better than others. Children tend to naturally enjoy a variety of foods until
they are taught that some are considered less desirable than others. Most important is not to
force your child to eat or fight over eating food.

Early childhood is a time of pretending, blending fact and fiction, and learning to think of the
world using language. As young children move away from needing to touch, feel, and hear about
the world, they begin learning basic principles about how the world works. Concepts such as
tomorrow, time, size, distance and fact vs. fiction are not easy to grasp at this age, but these tasks
are all part of cognitive development during early childhood.

Piaget’s Preoperational Stage
Piaget’s stage that coincides with early childhood is the preoperational stage. According to
Piaget, this stage occurs from the age of 2 to 7 years. In the preoperational stage, children use
symbols to represent words, images, and ideas, which is why children in this stage engage in
pretend play. A child’s arms might become airplane wings as she zooms around the room, or a
child with a stick might become a brave knight with a sword. Children also begin to use
language in the preoperational stage, but they cannot understand adult logic or mentally
manipulate information. The term operational refers to logical manipulation of information, so
children at this stage are considered pre-operational. Children’s logic is based on their own
personal knowledge of the world so far, rather than on conventional knowledge.
The preoperational period is divided into two stages: The symbolic function substage occurs
between 2 and 4 years of age and is characterized by the child being able to mentally represent an
object that is not present and a dependence on perception in problem solving. The intuitive
thought substage, lasting from 4 to 7 years, is marked by greater dependence on intuitive thinking
rather than just perception (Thomas, 1979). This implies that children think automatically
without using evidence. At this stage, children ask many questions as they attempt to understand
the world around them using immature reasoning. Let us examine some of Piaget’s assertions
about children’s cognitive abilities at this age.

Pretend Play: Pretending is a favorite activity
at this time. A toy has qualities beyond the
way it was designed to function and can now
be used to stand for a character or object
unlike anything originally intended. A teddy
bear, for example, can be a baby or the queen
of a faraway land. Piaget believed that
children’s pretend play helped children
solidify new schemata they were developing
cognitively. This play, then, reflected changes
in their conceptions or thoughts. However,
children also learn as they pretend and
experiment. Their play does not simply
represent what they have learned (Berk,
2007).

Egocentrism: Egocentrism in early childhood refers to the tendency of young children not to be
able to take the perspective of others, and instead the child thinks that everyone sees, thinks, and
feels just as they do. Egocentric children are not able to infer the perspective of other people and
instead attribute their own perspective to situations. For example, ten-year-old Keiko’s birthday
is coming up, so her mom takes 3-year-old Kenny to the toy store to choose a present for his
sister. He selects an Iron Man action figure for her, thinking that if he likes the toy, his sister will
too.
Piaget’s classic experiment on egocentrism involved showing
children a three-dimensional model of a mountain and asking
them to describe what a doll that is looking at the mountain
from a different angle might see (see Figure 4.9). Children
tend to choose a picture that represents their own, rather than
the doll’s view. By age 7 children are less self-centered.
However, even younger children when speaking to others tend
to use different sentence structures and vocabulary when
addressing a younger child or an older adult. This indicates
some awareness of the views of others.

Figure 4.9 “What does
Dolly see?”

Conservation Errors: Conservation refers to the ability to
Source
recognize that moving or rearranging matter does not change
the quantity. Using Kenny and Keiko again, dad gave a slice of pizza to 10-year-old Keiko and
another slice to 3-year-old Kenny. Kenny’s pizza slice was cut into five pieces, so Kenny told his
sister that he got more pizza than she did. Kenny did not understand that cutting the pizza into smaller
pieces did not increase the overall amount. This was because Kenny exhibited centration or focused on
only one characteristic of an object to the exclusion of others. Kenny focused on the five pieces of pizza to
his sister’s one piece even though the total amount was the same. Keiko was able to consider several
characteristics of an object than just one. Because children have not developed this understanding of
conservation, they cannot perform mental operations.

The classic Piagetian experiment
Figure 4.10 Conservation of Liquid. Does
associated with conservation involves
pouring liquid in a tall, narrow container make it
liquid (Crain, 2005). As seen in Figure
have more?
4.10, the child is shown two glasses
(as shown in a) which are filled to the
same level and asked if they have the
same amount. Usually the child
agrees they have the same amount.
The experimenter then pours the liquid
in one glass to a taller and thinner
glass (as shown in b). The child is
again asked if the two glasses have the
same amount of liquid. The
preoperational child will typically say
the taller glass now has more liquid because it is taller (as shown in c). The child has centrated
on the height of the glass and fails to conserve.
Classification Errors: Preoperational children have difficulty understanding that an object can
be classified in more than one way. For example, if shown three white buttons and four black
buttons and asked whether there are more black buttons or buttons, the child is likely to respond
that there are more black buttons. They do not consider the general class of buttons. Because
young children lack these general classes, their reasoning is typically transductive, that is,
making faulty inferences from one specific example to another. For example, Piaget’s daughter
Lucienne stated she had not had her nap, therefore it was not afternoon. She did not understand
that afternoons are a time period and her nap was just one of many events that occurred in the
afternoon (Crain, 2005). As the child’s vocabulary improves and more schemata are developed,
the ability to classify objects improves.
Animism: Animism refers to attributing life-like qualities to objects. The cup is alive, the chair
that falls down and hits the child’s ankle is mean, and the toys need to stay home because they
are tired. Cartoons frequently show objects that appear alive and take on lifelike qualities.
Young children do seem to think that objects that move may be alive, but after age three, they
seldom refer to objects as being alive (Berk, 2007).
Critique of Piaget: Similar to the critique of the sensorimotor period, several psychologists
have attempted to show that Piaget also underestimated the intellectual capabilities of the
preoperational child. For example, children’s specific experiences can influence when they are
able to conserve. Children of pottery makers in Mexican villages know that reshaping clay does
not change the amount of clay at much younger ages than children who do not have similar
experiences (Price-Williams, Gordon, & Ramirez, 1969). Crain (2005) indicated that
preoperational children can think rationally on mathematical and scientific tasks, and they are not
as egocentric as Piaget implied. Research on Theory of Mind (discussed later in the chapter) has
demonstrated that children overcome egocentrism by 4 or 5 years of age, which is sooner than
Piaget indicated.

Vygotsky’s Sociocultural Theory of Cognitive Development
Figure 4.11 Lev Vygotsky

Lev Vygotsky (1896-1934) was a Russian psychologist who
argued that culture has a major impact on a child’s cognitive
development. Piaget and Gesell believed development
stemmed directly from the child, and although Vygotsky
acknowledged intrinsic development, he argued that it is the
language, writings, and concepts arising from the culture that
elicit the highest level of cognitive thinking (Crain, 2005). He
believed that the social interactions with adults and more
learned peers can facilitate a child’s potential for learning.
Without this interpersonal instruction, he believed children’s
minds would not advance very far as their knowledge would
be based only on their own discoveries. Some of Vygotsky’s
key concepts are described below.

Zone of Proximal Development and Scaffolding:
Vygotsky’s best-known concept is the zone of proximal
development (ZPD). Vygotsky stated that children should be taught in the ZPD, which occurs
when they can almost perform a task, but not quite on their own without assistance. With the
right kind of teaching, however, they can accomplish it successfully. A good teacher identifies a
child’s ZPD and helps the child stretch beyond it. Then the adult (teacher) gradually withdraws
support until the child can then perform the task unaided. Researchers have applied the metaphor
of scaffolds (the temporary platforms on which construction workers stand) to this way of
teaching. Scaffolding is the temporary support that parents or teachers give a child to do a task.

Private Speech: Do you ever talk to yourself? Why? Chances are, this occurs when you are
struggling with a problem, trying to remember something, or feel very emotional about a
situation. Children talk to themselves too. Piaget interpreted this as egocentric speech or speech
that is focused on the child and does not include another’s point of view.
Vygotsky, however, believed that children talk to
themselves in order to solve problems or clarify
thoughts. As children learn to think in words, they do
so aloud before eventually closing their lips and
engaging in private speech or inner speech.
Thinking out loud eventually becomes thought
accompanied by internal speech and talking to oneself
becomes a practice only engaged in when we are
trying to learn something or remember
something. This inner speech is not as elaborate as
the speech we use when communicating with others
(Vygotsky, 1962).

Contrast with Piaget: Piaget was highly critical of teacher-directed instruction believing that
teachers who take control of the child’s learning place the child into a passive role (Crain, 2005).
Further, teachers may present abstract ideas without the child’s true understanding, and instead
they just repeat back what they heard. Piaget believed children must be given opportunities to
discover concepts on their own. As previously stated, Vygotsky did not believe children could
reach a higher cognitive level without instruction from more learned individuals. Who is
correct? Both theories certainly contribute to our understanding of how children learn.

Information Processing
Information processing researchers have focused on several issues in cognitive development for
this age group, including improvements in attention skills, changes in the capacity and the
emergence of executive functions in working memory. Additionally, in early childhood memory
strategies, memory accuracy, and autobiographical memory emerge. Early childhood is seen by
many researchers as a crucial time period in memory development (Posner & Rothbart, 2007).

Attention
Changes in attention have been described by many as the key to changes in human memory
(Nelson & Fivush, 2004; Posner & Rothbart, 2007). However, attention is not a unified
function; it is comprised of sub-processes. The ability to switch our focus between tasks or
external stimuli is called divided attention or multitasking. This is separate from our ability to
focus on a single task or stimulus, while ignoring distracting information, called selective
attention. Different from these is sustained attention, or the ability to stay on task for long
periods of time. Moreover, we also have attention processes that influence our behavior and
enable us to inhibit a habitual or dominant response, and others that enable us to distract
ourselves when upset or frustrated.

Figure 4.13 These children

playing

Source

Divided Attention: Young children (age 3-4) have
considerable difficulties in dividing their attention
between two tasks, and often perform at levels equivalent
to our closest relative, the chimpanzee, but by age five
they have surpassed the chimp (Hermann, Misch,
Hernandez-Lloreda & Tomasello, 2015; Hermann &
Tomasello, 2015). Despite these improvements, 5-yearolds continue to perform below the level of school-age
children, adolescents, and adults.
Selective Attention: Children’s ability with selective
attention tasks improve as they age. However, this ability
is also greatly influenced by the child’s temperament
(Rothbart & Rueda, 2005), the complexity of the stimulus
or task (Porporino, Shore, Iarocci & Burack, 2004), and
along with whether the stimuli are visual or auditory
(Guy, Rogers & Cornish, 2013). Guy et al. found that
children’s ability to selectively attend to visual
127

information outpaced that of auditory stimuli. This may explain why young children are not able
to hear the voice of the teacher over the cacophony of sounds in the typical preschool classroom
(Jones, Moore & Amitay, 2015). Jones and his colleagues found that 4 to 7-year-olds could not
filter out background noise, especially when its frequencies were close in sound to the target
sound. In comparison, 8 to 11-year-old older children often performed similar to adults.
Sustained Attention: Most measures of sustained attention typically ask children to spend
several minutes focusing on one task, while waiting for an infrequent event, while there are
multiple distractors for several minutes. Berwid, Curko-Kera, Marks and Halperin (2005) asked
children between the ages of 3 and 7 to push a button whenever a “target” image was displayed,
but they had to refrain from pushing the button when a non-target image was shown. The
younger the child, the more difficulty he or she had maintaining their attention.

Memory
Based on studies of adults, people with amnesia, and neurological research on memory,
researchers have proposed several “types” of memory (see Figure 4.14). Sensory memory (also
called the sensory register) is the first stage of the memory system, and it stores sensory input in
its raw form for a very brief duration; essentially long enough for the brain to register and start
processing the information. Studies of auditory sensory memory have found that the sensory
memory trace for the characteristics of a tone last about one second in 2-year-olds, two seconds
in 3-year-olds, more than two seconds in 4-year-olds and three to five seconds in 6-year-olds
(Glass, Sachse, & vob Suchodoletz, 2008). Other researchers have found that young children
hold sounds for a shorter duration than do older children and adults, and that this deficit is not
due to attentional differences between these age groups but reflect differences in the performance
of the sensory memory system (Gomes et al., 1999).

Figure 4.14

128

The second stage of the memory system is called short-term or working memory. Working
memory is the component of memory in which current conscious mental activity occurs.
Working memory often requires conscious effort and adequate use of attention to function
effectively. As you read earlier, children in this age group struggle with many aspects of
attention, and this greatly diminishes their ability to consciously juggle several pieces of
information in memory. The capacity of working memory, that is the amount of information
someone can hold in consciousness, is smaller in young children than in older children and adults
(Galotti, 2018). The typical adult and teenager can hold a 7-digit number active in their shortterm memory. The typical 5-year-old can hold only a 4-digit number active. This means that the
more complex a mental task is, the less efficient a younger child will be in paying attention to,
and actively processing, information in order to complete the task.
Changes in attention and the working memory system also involve changes in executive
function. Executive function (EF) refers to self-regulatory processes, such as the ability to
inhibit a behavior or cognitive flexibility, that enable adaptive responses to new situations or to
reach a specific goal. Executive function skills gradually emerge during early childhood and
continue to develop throughout childhood and adolescence. Like many cognitive changes, brain
maturation, especially the prefrontal cortex, along with experience influence the development of
executive function skills. Children show higher executive function skills when parents are warm
and responsive, use scaffolding when the child is trying to solve a problem, and provide
cognitively stimulating environments (Fay-Stammbach, Hawes & Meredith, 2014). For
instance, scaffolding was positively correlated with greater cognitive flexibility at age two and
inhibitory control at age four (Bibok, Carpendale & Müller, 2009).
Older children and adults use mental strategies to aid their memory performance. For instance,
simple rote rehearsal may be used to commit information to memory. Young children often do
not rehearse unless reminded to do so, and when they do rehearse, they often fail to use
clustering rehearsal. In clustering rehearsal, the person rehearses previous material while
adding in additional information. If a list of words is read out loud to you, you are likely to
rehearse each word as you hear it along with any previous words you were given. Young
children will repeat each word they hear, but often fail to repeat the prior words in the list. In
Schneider, Kron-Sperl and Hunnerkopf’s (2009) longitudinal study of 102 kindergarten children,
the majority of children used no strategy to remember information, a finding that was consistent
with previous research. As a result, their memory performance was poor when compared to their
abilities as they aged and started to use more effective memory strategies.
The third component in memory is long-term memory, which is also known as permanent
memory. A basic division of long-term memory is between declarative and non-declarative
memory. Declarative memories, sometimes referred to as explicit memories, are memories for
facts or events that we can consciously recollect. Non-declarative memories, sometimes
referred to as implicit memories, are typically automated skills that do not require conscious
recollection. Remembering that you have an exam next week would be an example of a
declarative memory. In contrast, knowing how to walk so you can get to the classroom or how
to hold a pencil to write would be examples of non-declarative memories. Declarative memory
is further divided into semantic and episodic memory. Semantic memories are memories for
facts and knowledge that are not tied to a timeline, while episodic memories are tied to specific
events in time.
129

Figure 4.15 How long will
these children remember
their trip to Disneyland?

A component of episodic memory is autobiographical
memory, or our personal narrative. As you may recall in
Chapter 3, the concept of infantile amnesia was introduced.
Adults rarely remember events from the first few years of
life. In other words, we lack autobiographical memories
from our experiences as an infant, toddler and very young
preschooler. Several factors contribute to the emergence of
autobiographical memory, including brain maturation,
improvements in language, opportunities to talk about
experiences with parents and others, the development of
theory of mind, and a representation of “self” (Nelson &
Fivush, 2004). Two-year-olds do remember fragments of
personal experiences, but these are rarely coherent accounts
of past events (Nelson & Ross, 1980). Between 2 and 2 ½
years of age children can provide more information about
past experiences. However, these recollections require
considerable prodding by adults (Nelson & Fivush, 2004).
Over the next few years, children will form more detailed
autobiographical memories and engage in more reflection of
the past.

Neo-Piagetians
As previously discussed, Piaget’s theory has been criticized on many fronts, and updates to
reflect more current research have been provided by the Neo-Piagetians, or those theorists who
provide “new” interpretations of Piaget’s theory. Morra, Gobbo, Marini and Sheese (2008)
reviewed Neo-Piagetian theories, which were first presented in the 1970s, and identified how
these “new” theories combined Piagetian concepts with those found in Information Processing.
Similar to Piaget’s theory, Neo-Piagetian theories believe in constructivism, assume cognitive
development can be separated into different stages with qualitatively different characteristics,
and advocate that children’s thinking becomes more complex in advanced stages. Unlike Piaget,
Neo-Piagetians believe that aspects of information processing change the complexity of each
stage, not logic as determined by Piaget.
Neo-Piagetians propose that working memory capacity is affected by biological maturation, and
therefore restricts young children’s ability to acquire complex thinking and reasoning skills.
Increases in working memory performance and cognitive skills development coincide with the
timing of several neurodevelopmental processes. These include myelination, axonal and
synaptic pruning, changes in cerebral metabolism, and changes in brain activity (Morra et al.,
2008). Myelination especially occurs in waves between birth and adolescence, and the degree of
myelination in particular areas explains the increasing efficiency of certain skills. Therefore,
brain maturation, which occurs in spurts, affects how and when cognitive skills develop.
Additionally, all Neo-Piagetian theories support that experience and learning interact with
biological maturation in shaping cognitive development.

130

Children’s Understanding of the World
Both Piaget and Vygotsky believed that children actively try to understand the world around
them, referred to as constructivism. However, Piaget is identified as a cognitive
constructivitst, which focuses on independent learning, while Vygotsky is a social constrctivist
relying on social interactions for learning. More recently developmentalists have added to this
understanding by examining how children organize information and develop their own theories
about the world.
Theory-Theory is the tendency of
children to generate theories to
Figure 4.16
explain everything they encounter.
This concept implies that humans
are naturally inclined to find
reasons and generate explanations
for why things occur. Children
frequently ask question about what
they see or hear around them.
When the answers provided do not
satisfy their curiosity or are too
complicated for them to understand,
they generate their own theories. In
much the same way that scientists
construct and revise their theories,
Source
children do the same with their
intuitions about the world as they
encounter new experiences (Gopnik & Wellman, 2012). One of the theories they start to generate
in early childhood centers on the mental states; both their own and those of others.
Theory of mind refers to the ability to think about other people’s thoughts. This mental mind
reading helps humans to understand and predict the reactions of others, thus playing a crucial
role in social development. One common method for determining if a child has reached this
mental milestone is the false belief task. The research began with a clever experiment by
Wimmer and Perner (1983), who tested whether children can pass a false-belief test (see Figure
4.17). The child is shown a picture story of Sally, who puts her ball in a basket and leaves the
room. While Sally is out of the room, Anne comes along and takes the ball from the basket and
puts it inside a box. The child is then asked where Sally thinks the ball is located when she
comes back to the room. Is she going to look first in the box or in the basket? The right answer is
that she will look in the basket, because that is where she put it and thinks it is; but we have to
infer this false belief against our own better knowledge that the ball is in the box. This is very
difficult for children before the age of four because of the cognitive effort it takes. Three-yearolds have difficulty distinguishing between what they once thought was true and what they now
know to be true. They feel confident that what they know now is what they have always known
(Birch & Bloom, 2003). Even adults need to think through this task (Epley, Morewedge, &
Keysar, 2004). To be successful at solving this type of task the child must separate what he or
she “knows” to be true from what someone else might “think” is true.
131

In Piagetian terms, children must give up a
tendency toward egocentrism. The child must
also understand that what guides people’s
actions and responses are what they believe
rather than what is reality. In other words,
people can mistakenly believe things that are
false and will act based on this false knowledge.
Consequently, prior to age four children are
rarely successful at solving such a task
(Wellman, Cross & Watson, 2001).

Figure 4. 17

Researchers examining the development of
theory of mind have been concerned by the
overemphasis on the mastery of false belief as
the primary measure of whether a child has
attained theory of mind. Two-year-olds
understand the diversity of desires, yet as noted
earlier it is not until age four or five that
children grasp false belief, and often not until
middle childhood do they understand that
people may hide how they really feel. In part,
because children in early childhood have
difficulty hiding how they really feel. Wellman
and his colleagues (Wellman, Fang, Liu, Zhu &
Liu, 2006) suggest that theory of mind is
comprised of a number of components, each
with its own developmental timeline (see Table
4.2).
Those in early childhood in the US, Australia,
and Germany develop theory of mind in the
Source
sequence outlined in Table 4.2. Yet, Chinese
and Iranian preschoolers acquire knowledge access before diverse beliefs (Shahaeian, Peterson,
Slaughter & Wellman, 2011). Shahaeian and colleagues suggested that cultural differences in
child-rearing may account for this reversal. Parents in collectivistic cultures, such as China and
Iran, emphasize conformity to the family and cultural values, greater respect for elders, and the
acquisition of knowledge and academic skills more than they do autonomy and social skills
(Frank, Plunkett & Otten, 2010). This could reduce the degree of familial conflict of opinions
expressed in the family. In contrast, individualistic cultures encourage children to think for
themselves and assert their own opinion, and this could increase the risk of conflict in beliefs
being expressed by family members. As a result, children in individualistic cultures would
acquire insight into the question of diversity of belief earlier, while children in collectivistic
cultures would acquire knowledge access earlier in the sequence. The role of conflict in aiding
the development of theory of mind may account for the earlier age of onset of an understanding
of false belief in children with siblings, especially older siblings (McAlister & Petersen, 2007;
Perner, Ruffman & Leekman, 1994).

This awareness of the existence of theory of mind is part of social intelligence, such as
recognizing that others can think differently about situations. It helps us to be self-conscious or
aware that others can think of us in different ways and it helps us to be able to be understanding
or be empathic toward others. Moreover, this mind reading ability helps us to anticipate and
predict people’s actions. The awareness of the mental states of others is important for
communication and social skills.

Language Development
Vocabulary growth: A child’s vocabulary expands between the ages of two to six from about
200 words to over 10,000 words. This “vocabulary spurt” typically involves 10-20 new words
per week and is accomplished through a process called fast-mapping. Words are easily learned
by making connections between new words and concepts already known. The parts of speech that
are learned depend on the language and what is emphasized. Children speaking verb-friendly
languages, such as Chinese and Japanese, learn verbs more readily, while those speaking English
tend to learn nouns more readily. However, those learning less verb-friendly languages, such as
English, seem to need assistance in grammar to master the use of verbs (Imai et al., 2008).
Literal meanings: Children can repeat words and phrases after having heard them only once or
twice, but they do not always understand the meaning of the words or phrases. This is especially
true of expressions or figures of speech which are taken literally. For example, a classroom full
of preschoolers hears the teacher say, “Wow! That was a piece of cake!” The children began
asking “Cake? Where is my cake? I want cake!”
Overregularization: Children learn rules of grammar as they learn language but may apply
these rules inappropriately at first. For instance, a child learns to add “ed” to the end of a word to
indicate past tense. Then form a sentence such as “I goed there. I doed that.” This is typical at
ages two and three. They will soon learn new words such as “went” and “did” to be used in
those situations.
The impact of training: Remember Vygotsky and the Zone of Proximal Development?
Children can be assisted in learning language by others who listen attentively, model more
accurate pronunciations and encourage elaboration. The child exclaims, “I’m goed there!” and
133

the adult responds, “You went there? Say, ‘I went there.’ Where did you go?” Children may be
ripe for language as Chomsky suggests, but active participation in helping them learn is
important for language development as well. The process of scaffolding is one in which the
guide provides needed assistance to the child as a new skill is learned.

Bilingualism
Although monolingual speakers often do not realize it, the majority of children around the world
are Bilingual, meaning that they understand and use two languages (Meyers-Sutton, 2005).
Even in the United States, which is a relatively monolingual society, more than 60 million people
(21%) speak a language other than English at home (Camarota & Zeigler, 2014; Ryan, 2013).
Children who are dual language learners are one of the fastest growing populations in the United
States (Hammer et al., 2014). They make up nearly 30% of children enrolled in early childhood
programs, like Head Start. By the time they enter school, they are very heterogeneous in their
language and literacy skills, with some children showing delays in being proficient in either one
or both languages (Hammer et al., 2014). Hoff (2018) reports language competency is
dependent on the quantity, quality, and opportunity to use a language. Dual language learners
may hear the same number of words and phrases (quantity) overall, as do monolingual children,
but it is split between two languages (Hoff, 2018). Thus, in any single language they may be
exposed to fewer words. They will show higher expressive and receptive skills in the language
they come to hear the most.
In addition, the quality of the languages spoken to the child may differ in bilingual versus
monolingual families. Place and Hoff (2016) found that for many immigrant children in the
United States, most of the English heard was spoken by a non-native speaker of the language.
Finally, many children in bilingual households will sometimes avoid using the family’s heritage
language in favor of the majority language (DeHouwer, 2007, Hoff, 2018). A common pattern in
Spanish-English homes, is for the parents to speak to the child in Spanish, but for the child to
respond in English. As a result, children may show little difference in the receptive skills
between English and Spanish, but better expressive skills in English (Hoff, 2018).
There are several studies that have documented the advantages of learning more than one
language in childhood for cognitive executive function skills. Bilingual children consistently
outperform monolinguals on measures of inhibitory control, such as ignoring irrelevant
information (Bialystok, Martin & Viswanathan, 2005). Studies also reveal an advantage for
bilingual children on measures of verbal working memory (Kaushanskaya, Gross, & Buac, 2014;
Yoo & Kaushanskaya, 2012) and non-verbal working memory (Bialystok, 2011). However, it
has been reported that among lower SES populations the working memory advantage is not
always found (Bonifacci, Giombini, Beloocchi, & Conteno, 2011).
There is also considerable research to show that being bilingual, either as a child or an adult,
leads to greater efficiency in the word learning process. Monolingual children are strongly
influenced by the mutual-exclusivity bias, the assumption that an object has only a single name
(Kaushanskaya, Gross, & Buac, 2014). For example, a child who has previously learned the
word car, may be confused when this object is referred to as an automobile or sedan. Research
shows that monolingual children find it easier to learn the name of a new object, than acquiring a
134

new name for a previously labelled object. In contrast, bilingual children and adults show little
difficulty with either task (Kaushanskaya & Marian, 2009). This finding may be explained by the
experience bilinguals have in translating between languages when referring to familiar objects.

Preschool
Providing universal preschool has become an important lobbying point for federal, state, and
local leaders throughout our country. In his 2013 State of the Union address, President Obama
called upon congress to provide high quality preschool for all children. He continued to support
universal preschool in his legislative agenda, and in December 2014 the President convened
state and local policymakers for the White House Summit on Early Education (White House
Press Secretary, 2014). However, universal preschool covering all four-year olds in the
country would require significant funding. Further, how effective preschools are in preparing
children for elementary school, and what constitutes high quality preschool have been debated.
To set criteria for designation as a high-quality preschool, the National Association for the
Education of Young Children (NAEYC) identifies 10 standards (NAEYC, 2016). These
include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Positive relationships among all children and adults are promoted.
A curriculum that supports learning and development in social, emotional, physical,
language, and cognitive areas.
Teaching approaches that are developmentally, culturally and linguistically appropriate.
Assessment of children’s progress to provide information on learning and development.
The health and nutrition of children are promoted, while they are protected from illness
and injury.
Teachers possess the educational qualifications, knowledge, and commitment to promote
children’s learning.
Collaborative relationships with families are established and maintained.
Relationships with agencies and institutions in the children’s communities are established
to support the program’s goals.
The indoor and outdoor physical environments are safe and well-maintained.
Leadership and management personnel are well qualified, effective, and maintain
licensure status with the applicable state agency.

Parents should review preschool programs using the NAEYC criteria as a guide and template for
asking questions that will assist them in choosing the best program for their child. Selecting the
right preschool is also difficult because there are so many types of preschools available. Zachry
(2013) identified Montessori, Waldorf, Reggio Emilia, High Scope, Parent Co-Ops and Bank
Street as types of preschool programs that focus on children learning through discovery.
Teachers act as guides and create activities based on the child’s developmental level.

poverty, Head Start has been
providing preschool education since
1965 when it was begun by President
Lyndon Johnson as part of his war on
poverty. It currently serves nearly
one million children and annually
costs approximately 7.5 billion
dollars (United States Department of
Health and Human Services, 2015).
However, concerns about the
effectiveness of Head Start have been
ongoing since the program began.
Armor (2015) reviewed existing
research on Head Start and found
Source
there were no lasting gains, and the
average child in Head Start had not
learned more than children who did not receive preschool education.
A 2015 report evaluating the effectiveness of Head Start comes from the What Works
Clearinghouse. The What Works Clearinghouse identifies research that provides reliable
evidence of the effectiveness of programs and practices in education and is managed by the
Institute of Education Services for the United States Department of Education. After reviewing
90 studies on the effectiveness of Head Start, only one study was deemed scientifically
acceptable and this study showed disappointing results (Barshay, 2015). This study showed that
3-and 4-year-old children in Head Start received “potentially positive effects” on general reading
achievement, but no noticeable effects on math achievement and social-emotional development.
Nonexperimental designs are a significant problem in determining the effectiveness of Head
Start programs because a control group is needed to show group differences that would
demonstrate educational benefits. Because of ethical reasons, low income children are usually
provided with some type of pre-school programming in an alternative setting. Additionally, head
Start programs are different depending on the location, and these differences include the length
of the day or qualification of the teachers. Lastly, testing young children is difficult and strongly
dependent on their language skills and comfort level with an evaluator (Barshay, 2015).

Autism Spectrum Disorder
A greater discussion on disorders affecting children and special educational services to assist
them will occur in Chapter 5. However, because characteristics of Autism Spectrum Disorder
must be present in the early developmental period, as established by the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) (American Psychiatric Association (APA),
2013), this disorder will be presented here. So, what exactly is an Autism Spectrum Disorder?
Autism spectrum disorder is probably the most misunderstood and puzzling of the
neurodevelopmental disorders. Children with this disorder show signs of significant
disturbances in three main areas: (a) deficits in social interaction, (b) deficits in
136

communication, and (c) repetitive patterns of behavior or interests. These disturbances
appear early in life and cause serious impairments in functioning (APA, 2013). The child
with autism spectrum disorder might exhibit deficits in social interaction by not initiating
conversations with other children or turning their head away when spoken to. These children do
not make eye contact with others and seem to prefer playing alone rather than with others. In a
certain sense, it is almost as though these individuals live in a personal and isolated social
world which others are simply not privy to or able to penetrate. Communication deficits can
range from a complete lack of speech, to one-word responses (e.g., saying “Yes” or “No”
when replying to questions or statements that require additional elaboration), to echoed
speech (e.g., parroting what another person says, either immediately or several hours or even
days later), and to difficulty maintaining a conversation because of an inability to
reciprocate others’ comments. These deficits can also include problems in using and
understanding nonverbal cues (e.g., facial expressions, gestures, and postures) that facilitate
normal communication.
Repetitive patterns of behavior or interests can be exhibited a number of ways. The child
might engage in stereotyped, repetitive movements (rocking, head-banging, or repeatedly
dropping an object and then picking it up), or she might show great distress at small
changes in routine or the environment. For example, the child might throw a temper tantrum
if an object is not in its proper place or if a regularly-scheduled activity is rescheduled. In
some cases, the person with autism spectrum disorder might show highly restricted and
fixated interests that appear to be abnormal in their intensity. For instance, the child might
learn and memorize every detail about something even though doing so serves no apparent
purpose. Importantly, autism spectrum disorder is not the same thing as intellectual disability,
although these two conditions can occur together. The DSM-5 specifies that the symptoms of
autism spectrum disorder are not caused or explained by intellectual disability.
The qualifier “spectrum” in autism spectrum disorder
is used to indicate that individuals with the disorder
can show a range, or spectrum, of symptoms that
vary in their magnitude and severity: Some severe,
others less severe. The previous edition of the DSM
included a diagnosis of Asperger’s disorder, generally
recognized as a less severe form of autistim spectrum
disorder. Individuals diagnosed with Asperger’s
disorder were described as having average or high
intelligence and a strong vocabulary, but exhibiting
impairments in social interaction and social
communication, such as talking only about their special
interests (Wing, Gould, & Gillberg, 2011). However,
because research has failed to demonstrate that
Source
Asperger’s disorder differs from autism spectrum
disorder, the DSM-5 does not include it. Some
individuals with autism spectrum disorder, particularly those with better language and
intellectual skills, can live and work independently as adults. However, most do not because
the symptoms cause serious impairment in many aspects of life (APA, 2013).

To determine current prevalence rates, the Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring
(ADDM) Network provides estimates of the prevalence of autism spectrum disorders among 8year-old children who reside within 11 ADM sites in the United States, including Arizona,
Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, North Carolina,
Tennessee, and Wisconsin (Baio et al., 2018). For 2014 (most recent data), estimates indicated
that nearly 1 in 59 children in the United States has autism spectrum disorder, and the disorder is
4 times more common in boys (1 out of 38) than girls (1 out of 152).
Rates of autistim spectrum disorder have increased dramatically since the 1980s. For example,
California saw an increase of 273% in reported cases from 1987 through 1998 (Byrd, 2002).
Between 2000 and 2008, the rate of autism diagnoses in the United States increased 78% (CDC,
2012) and between 2000 and 2014 the rate increased 150% (Baio et al., 2018). Although it is
difficult to interpret this increase, it is possible that the rise in prevalence is the result of the
broadening of the diagnosis, increased efforts to identify cases in the community, and greater
awareness and acceptance of the diagnosis. In addition, mental health professionals are now
more knowledgeable about autism spectrum disorder and are better equipped to make the
diagnosis, even in subtle cases (Novella, 2008).
The exact causes of autism spectrum disorder remain unknown despite massive research
efforts over the last two decades (Meek, Lemery-Chalfant, Jahromi, & Valiente, 2013). Autism
appears to be strongly influenced by genetics, as identical twins show concordance rates of 60%–
90%, whereas concordance rates for fraternal twins and siblings are 5%–10% (Autism Genome
Project Consortium, 2007). Many different genes and gene mutations have been implicated in
autism (Meek et al., 2013). Among the genes involved are those important in the formation of
synaptic circuits that facilitate communication between different areas of the brain (Gauthier
et al., 2011). A number of environmental factors are also thought to be associated with
increased risk for autism spectrum disorder, at least in part, because they contribute to new
mutations. These factors include exposure to pollutants, such as plant emissions and mercury,
urban versus rural residence, and vitamin D deficiency (Kinney, Barch, Chayka, Napoleon, &
Munir, 2009).
A recent Swedish study looking at the records of over one million children born between 1973
and 2014 found that exposure to prenatal infections increased the risk for autism spectrum
disorders (al-Haddad et al., 2019). Children born to mothers with an infection during pregnancy
has a 79% increased risk of autism. Infections included: sepsis, flu, pneumonia, meningitis,
encephalitis, an infection of the placental tissues or kidneys, or a urinary tract infection. One
possible reason for the autism diagnosis is that the fetal brain is extremely vulnerable to damage
from infections and inflammation. These results highlighted the importance of pregnant
women receiving a flu vaccination and avoiding any infections during pregnancy.
There is no scientific evidence that a link exists between autism and vaccinations (Hughes,
2007). Indeed, a recent study compared the vaccination histories of 256 children with autism
spectrum disorder with that of 752 control children across three time periods during their first
two years of life (birth to 3 months, birth to 7 months, and birth to 2 years) (DeStefano, Price, &
Weintraub, 2013). At the time of the study, the children were between 6 and 13 years old, and
their prior vaccination records were obtained. Because vaccines contain immunogens
138

(substances that fight infections), the investigators examined medical records to see how many
immunogens children received to determine if those children who received more immunogens
were at greater risk for developing autism spectrum disorder. The results of this study clearly
demonstrated that the quantity of immunogens from vaccines received during the first two
years of life were not at all related to the development of autism spectrum disorder.

Erikson: Initiative vs. Guilt
The trust and autonomy of previous stages develop into a desire to take initiative or to think of
ideas and initiative action (Erikson, 1982). Children may want to build a fort with the cushions
from the living room couch or open a lemonade stand in the driveway or make a zoo with their
stuffed animals and issue tickets to those who want to come. Or they may just want to get
themselves ready for bed without any assistance. To reinforce taking initiative, caregivers should
offer praise for the child’s efforts and avoid being critical of messes or mistakes. Placing
pictures of drawings on the refrigerator, purchasing mud pies for dinner, and admiring towers of
legos will facilitate the child’s sense of initiative.

Self-Concept and Self-Esteem
Early childhood is a time of forming an initial sense of self. Self-concept is our self-description
according to various categories, such as our external and internal qualities. In contrast, selfesteem is an evaluative judgment about who we are. The emergence of cognitive skills in this
age group results in improved perceptions of the self. If asked to describe yourself to others you
would likely provide some physical descriptors, group affiliation, personality traits, behavioral
quirks, values, and beliefs. When researchers ask young children the same open-ended question,
the children provide physical descriptors, preferred activities, and favorite possessions. Thus, a
three-year-old might describe herself as a three years-old girl with red hair, who likes to play
with legos. This focus on external qualities is referred to as the categorical self.
139

However, even children as young as three know there is more to themselves than these external
characteristics. Harter and Pike (1984) challenged the method of measuring personality with an
open-ended question as they felt that language limitations were hindering the ability of young
children to express their self-knowledge. They suggested a change to the method of measuring
self-concept in young children, whereby researchers provide statements that ask whether
something is true of the child (e.g., “I like to boss people around”, “I am grumpy most of the
time”). Consistent with Harter and Pike’s suspicions, those in early childhood answer these
statements in an internally consistent manner, especially after the age of four (Goodvin, Meyer,
Thompson & Hayes, 2008) and often give similar responses to what others (parents and teachers)
say about the child (Brown, Mangelsdorf, Agathen, & Ho, 2008; Colwell & Lindsey, 2003).
Young children tend to have a generally positive selfimage. This optimism is often the result of a lack of
social comparison when making self-evaluations
(Ruble, Boggiano, Feldman, & Loeble, 1980), and
with comparison between what the child once could
do to what they can do now (Kemple, 1995).
However, this does not mean that preschool children
are exempt from negative self-evaluations. Preschool
children with insecure attachments to their caregivers
tend to have lower self-esteem at age four (Goodvin
et al., 2008). Maternal negative affect was also found
by Goodwin and her colleagues to produce more
negative self-evaluations in preschool children.

Figure 4.20

Self-Control
Self-control is not a single phenomenon but is multi-facetted. It includes response initiation,
the ability to not initiate a behavior before you have evaluated all the information, response
inhibition, the ability to stop a behavior that has already begun, and delayed gratification, the
ability to hold out for a larger reward by forgoing a smaller immediate reward (Dougherty,
Marsh, Mathias, & Swann, 2005). It is in early childhood that we see the start of self-control, a
process that takes many years to fully develop. In the now classic “Marshmallow Test” (Mischel,
Ebbesen, & Zeiss, 1972) children are confronted with the choice of a small immediate reward (a
marshmallow) and a larger delayed reward (more marshmallows). Walter Mischel and his
colleagues over the years have found that the ability to delay gratification at the age of four
predicted better academic performance and health later in life (Mischel, et al., 2011). Selfcontrol is related to executive function, discussed earlier in the chapter. As executive function
improves, children become less impulsive (Traverso, Viterbori, & Usai, 2015).

Gender
Another important dimension of the self is the sense of self as male or female. Preschool aged
children become increasingly interested in finding out the differences between boys and girls,
both physically and in terms of what activities are acceptable for each. While two-year-olds can
140

identify some differences and learn whether they are boys or girls, preschoolers become more
interested in what it means to be male or female. Gender is the cultural, social and
psychological meanings associated with masculinity and feminity (Spears Brown & Jewell,
2018). A person’s sense of self as a member of a particular gender is known as gender identity.
The development of gender identity appears to be due to an interaction among biological, social
and representational influences (Ruble, Martin, & Berenbaum, 2006). Gender roles, or the
expectations associated with being male or female, are learned in one’s culture throughout
childhood and into adulthood.
Gender socialization focuses on what young children
learn about gender from society, including parents, peers,
media, religious institutions, schools, and public policies.
Children learn about what is acceptable for females and
males early, and in fact, this socialization may even begin
the moment a parent learns that a child is on the
way. Knowing the sex of the child can conjure up images
of the child’s behavior, appearance, and potential on the
part of a parent, and this stereotyping continues to guide
perception through life. Consider parents of newborns,
shown a 7-pound, 20-inch baby, wrapped in blue (a color
designating males) describe the child as tough, strong, and
angry when crying. Shown the same infant in pink (a
color used in the United States for baby girls), these
parents are likely to describe the baby as pretty, delicate,
and frustrated when crying (Maccoby & Jacklin,
1987). Female infants are held more, talked to more
frequently and given direct eye contact, while male infant
interactions are often mediated through a toy or activity.

Figure 4.21 Gender Roles

Source

As they age, sons are given tasks that take them outside the house and that have to be performed
only on occasion, while girls are more likely to be given chores inside the home, such as
cleaning or cooking that are performed daily. Sons are encouraged to think for themselves when
they encounter problems and daughters are more likely to be given assistance, even when they
are working on an answer. Parents also talk to their children differently according to their
gender. For example, parents talk to sons more in detail about science, and they discuss numbers
and counting twice as often than with daughters (Chang, Sandhofer, & Brown, 2011). How are
these beliefs about behaviors and expectations based on gender transmitted to children?

Theories of Gender Development
One theory of gender development in children is social learning theory, which argues that
behavior is learned through observation, modeling, reinforcement, and punishment (Bandura,
1997). Children are rewarded and reinforced for behaving in concordance with gender roles that
have been presented to them since birth and punished for breaking gender roles. In addition,
social learning theory states that children learn many of their gender roles by modeling the
behavior of adults and older children and, in doing so, develop ideas about what behaviors are
141

appropriate for each gender. Cognitive social learning theory also emphasizes reinforcement,
punishment, and imitation, but adds cognitive processes. These processes include attention, selfregulation, and self-efficacy. Once children learn the significance of gender, they regulate their
own behavior based on internalized gender norms (Bussey & Bandura, 1999).
Another theory is that children develop their own conceptions of the attributes associated with
maleness or femaleness, which is referred to as gender schema theory (Bem, 1981). Once
children have identified with a particular gender, they seek out information about gender traits,
behaviors, and roles. This theory is more constructivist as children are actively acquiring their
gender. For example, friends discuss what is acceptable for boys and girls, and popularity may
be based on what is considered ideal behavior for their gender.
Developmental intergroup theory states that many of our gender stereotypes are so strong
because we emphasize gender so much in culture (Bigler & Liben, 2007). Developmental
intergroup theory postulates that adults’ heavy focus on gender leads children to pay attention to
gender as a key source of information about themselves and others, to seek out any possible
gender differences, and to form rigid stereotypes based on gender that are subsequently difficult
to change.

Transgender Children
Many young children do not conform to the gender roles modeled by the culture and even push
back against assigned roles. However, a small percentage of children actively reject the toys,
clothing, and anatomy of their assigned sex and state they prefer the toys, clothing and anatomy
of the opposite sex. Approximately 0.3 percent of the United States population identify as
transgender or identifying with the gender opposite their natal sex (Olson & Gülgöz, 2018).
Transgender adults have stated that they identified with the opposite gender as soon as they
began talking (Russo, 2016). Some of these children may experience gender dysphoria, or
distress accompanying a mismatch between one’s gender identity and biological sex (APA,
2013), while other children do not experience discomfort regarding their gender identity.
Current research is now looking at those young children who identify as transgender and have
socially transitioned. In 2013, a longitudinal study following 300 socially transitioned
transgender children between the ages of 3 and 12 began (Olson & Gülgöz, 2018). Socially
transitioned transgender children identify with the gender opposite than the one assigned at birth,
and they change their appearance and pronouns to reflect their gender identity. Findings from
the study indicated that the gender development of these socially transitioned children looked
similar to the gender development of cisgender children, or those whose gender and sex
assignment at birth matched. These socially transitioned transgender children exhibited similar
gender preferences and gender identities as their gender matched peers. Further, these children
who were living everyday according to their gender identity and were supported by their
families, exhibited positive mental health.
Some individuals who identify as transgender are intersex; that is born with either an absence or
some combination of male and female reproductive organs, sex hormones, or sex chromosomes
(Jarne & Auld, 2006). In humans, intersex individuals make up more than 150 million people, or
142

about two percent of the world’s population (Blackless et al., 2000). There are dozens of intersex
conditions, and intersex individuals demonstrate the diverse variations of biological sex. Some
examples of intersex conditions include:
•
•
•

Turner syndrome or the absence of, or an imperfect, second X chromosome
Congenital adrenal hyperplasia or a genetic disorder caused by an increased
production of androgens
Androgen insensitivity syndrome or when a person has one X and one Y chromosome,
but is resistant to the male hormones or androgens

Greater attention to the rights of children born intersex is occurring in the medical field, and
intersex children and their parents should work closely with specialists to ensure these children
develop positive gender identities.
How much does gender matter for children: Starting at birth, children learn the social
meanings of gender from adults and their culture. Gender roles and expectations are especially
portrayed in children’s toys, books, commercials, video games, movies, television shows and
music (Khorr, 2017). Therefore, when children make choices regarding their gender
identification, expression, and behavior that may be contrary to gender stereotypes, it is
important that they feel supported by the caring adults in their lives. This support allows children
to feel valued, resilient, and develop a secure sense of self (American Academy of Pediatricians,
2015).

Parenting Styles
Relationships between parents and children continue to play a significant role in children’s
development during early childhood. As children mature, parent-child relationships naturally
change. Preschool and grade-school children are more capable, have their own preferences, and
sometimes refuse or seek to compromise with parental expectations. This can lead to greater
parent-child conflict, and how conflict is managed by parents further shapes the quality of
parent-child relationships.
Baumrind (1971) identified a model of parenting
that focuses on the level of control/ expectations that
parents have regarding their children and how
warm/responsive they are. This model resulted in
four parenting styles. In general, children develop
greater competence and self-confidence when
parents have high, but reasonable expectations for
children’s behavior, communicate well with them,
are warm, loving and responsive, and use reasoning,
rather than coercion as preferred responses to
children’s misbehavior. This kind of parenting style
has been described as authoritative (Baumrind,
2013). Authoritative parents are supportive and
show interest in their kids’ activities but are not
143

Figure 4.22 Authoritative Parenting

Source

overbearing and allow them to make constructive mistakes. Parents allow negotiation where
appropriate, and consequently this type of parenting is considered more democratic.
Authoritarian is the traditional model of parenting in which parents make the rules and
children are expected to be obedient. Baumrind suggests that authoritarian parents tend to place
maturity demands on their children that are unreasonably high and tend to be aloof and
distant. Consequently, children reared in this way may fear rather than respect their parents and,
because their parents do not allow discussion, may take out their frustrations on safer targetsperhaps as bullies toward peers.
Permissive parenting involves holding expectations of children that are below what could be
reasonably expected from them. Children are allowed to make their own rules and determine
their own activities. Parents are warm and communicative but provide little structure for their
children. Children fail to learn self-discipline and may feel somewhat insecure because they do
not know the limits.
Uninvolved parents are disengaged from their children. They do not make demands on their
children and are non-responsive. These children can suffer in school and in their relationships
with their peers (Gecas & Self, 1991).
Keep in mind that most parents do not follow any model completely. Real people tend to fall
somewhere in between these styles. Sometimes parenting styles change from one child to the
next or in times when the parent has more or less time and energy for parenting. Parenting styles
can also be affected by concerns the parent has in other areas of his or her life. For example,
parenting styles tend to become more authoritarian when parents are tired and perhaps more
authoritative when they are more energetic. Sometimes parents seem to change their parenting
approach when others are around, maybe because they become more self-conscious as parents or
are concerned with giving others the impression that they are a “tough” parent or an “easygoing” parent. Additionally, parenting styles may reflect the type of parenting someone saw
modeled while growing up. See Table 4.3 for Baumrind’s parenting style descriptions.
Table 4.3 Comparison of Four Parenting Styles

144

Culture: The impact of culture and class cannot be ignored when examining parenting
styles. The model of parenting described above assumes that the authoritative style is the best
because this style is designed to help the parent raise a child who is independent, self-reliant and
responsible. These are qualities favored in “individualistic” cultures such as the United States,
particularly by the middle class. However, in “collectivistic” cultures such as China or Korea,
being obedient and compliant are favored behaviors. Authoritarian parenting has been used
historically and reflects cultural need for children to do as they are told. African-American,
Hispanic and Asian parents tend to be more authoritarian than non-Hispanic whites. In societies
where family members’ cooperation is necessary for survival, rearing children who are
independent and who strive to be on their own makes no sense. However, in an economy based
on being mobile in order to find jobs and where one’s earnings are based on education, raising a
child to be independent is very important.
In a classic study on social class and parenting styles, Kohn (1977) explains that parents tend to
emphasize qualities that are needed for their own survival when parenting their children.
Working class parents are rewarded for being obedient, reliable, and honest in their jobs. They
are not paid to be independent or to question the management; rather, they move up and are
considered good employees if they show up on time, do their work as they are told, and can be
counted on by their employers. Consequently, these parents reward honesty and obedience in
their children. Middle class parents who work as professionals are rewarded for taking initiative,
being self-directed, and assertive in their jobs. They are required to get the job done without
being told exactly what to do. They are asked to be innovative and to work independently. These
parents encourage their children to have those qualities as well by rewarding independence and
self-reliance. Parenting styles can reflect many elements of culture.

Spanking
Spanking is often thought of as a rite of passage for children, and this method of discipline
continues to be endorsed by the majority of parents (Smith, 2012). Just how effective is
spanking, however, and are there any negative consequences? After reviewing the research,
Smith (2012) states “many studies have shown that physical punishment, including spanking,
hitting and other means of causing pain, can lead to increased aggression, antisocial behavior,
physical injury and mental health problems for children” (p. 60). Gershoff, (2008) reviewed
decades of research and recommended that parents and caregivers make every effort to avoid
physical punishment and called for the banning of physical discipline in all U.S. schools.
In a longitudinal study that followed more than 1500 families from 20 U.S. cities, parents’
reports of spanking were assessed at ages three and five (MacKenzie, Nicklas, Waldfogel, &
Brooks-Gunn, 2013). Measures of externalizing behavior and receptive vocabulary were
assessed at age nine. Results indicated that those children who were spanked at least twice a
week by their mothers scored 2.66 points higher on a measure of aggression and rule-breaking
than those who were never spanked. Additionally, those who were spanked less, still scored 1.17
points higher than those never spanked. When fathers did the spanking, those spanked at least
two times per week scored 5.7 points lower on a vocabulary test than those never spanked. This
study revealed the negative cognitive effects of spanking in addition to the increase in aggressive
behavior.
145

Internationally, physical discipline is increasingly being viewed as a violation of children’s
human rights. According to Save the Children (2019), 46 countries have banned the use of
physical punishment, and the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child (2014) called
physical punishment “legalized violence against children” and advocated that physical
punishment be eliminated in all settings.
Many alternatives to spanking are advocated by child development specialists and include:
• Praising and modeling appropriate behavior
• Providing time-outs for inappropriate behavior
• Giving choices
• Helping the child identify emotions and learning to calm down
• Ignoring small annoyances
• Withdrawing privileges

Sibling Relationships
Siblings spend a considerable amount of time with each
other and offer a unique relationship that is not found
with same-age peers or with adults. Siblings play an
important role in the development of social skills.
Cooperative and pretend play interactions between
younger and older siblings can teach empathy, sharing,
and cooperation (Pike, Coldwell, & Dunn, 2005), as well
as, negotiation and conflict resolution (Abuhatoum &
Howe, 2013). However, the quality of sibling
relationships is often mediated by the quality of the
Source:
parent-child relationship and the psychological
adjustment of the child (Pike et al., 2005). For instance,
more negative interactions between siblings have been reported in families where parents had
poor patterns of communication with their children (Brody, Stoneman, & McCoy, 1994).
Children who have emotional and behavioral problems are also more likely to have negative
interactions with their siblings. However, the psychological adjustment of the child can
sometimes be a reflection of the parent-child relationship. Thus, when examining the quality of
sibling interactions, it is often difficult to tease out the separate effect of adjustment from the
effect of the parent-child relationship.
Figure 4.23

While parents want positive interactions between their children, conflicts are going to arise, and
some confrontations can be the impetus for growth in children’s social and cognitive skills. The
sources of conflict between siblings often depend on their respective ages. Dunn and Munn
(1987) revealed that over half of all sibling conflicts in early childhood were disputes about
property rights. By middle childhood this starts shifting toward control over social situation,
such as what games to play, disagreements about facts or opinions, or rude behavior (Howe,
Rinaldi, Jennings, & Petrakos, 2002). Researchers have also found that the strategies children
use to deal with conflict change with age, but this is also tempered by the nature of the conflict.
Abuhatoum and Howe (2013) found that coercive strategies (e.g., threats) were preferred when
146

the dispute centered on property rights, while reasoning was more likely to be used by older
siblings and in disputes regarding control over the social situation. However, younger siblings
also use reasoning, frequently bringing up the concern of legitimacy (e.g., “You’re not the boss”)
when in conflict with an older sibling. This is a very common strategy used by younger siblings
and is possibly an adaptive strategy in order for younger siblings to assert their autonomy
(Abuhatoum & Howe, 2013). A number of researchers have found that children who can use
non-coercive strategies are more likely to have a successful resolution, whereby a compromise is
reached and neither child feels slighted (Ram & Ross, 2008; Abuhatoum & Howe, 2013). Not
surprisingly, friendly relationships with siblings often lead to more positive interactions with
peers. The reverse is also true. A child can also learn to get along with a sibling, with, as the
song says, “a little help from my friends” (Kramer & Gottman, 1992).

Play

distressing situations in a more secure environment.
Vygotsky and Piaget saw play as a way of children
developing their intellectual abilities (Dyer &
Moneta, 2006). All three theorists saw play as
providing positive outcomes for children. Parten
(1932) observed two to five-year-old children and
noted six types of play: Three labeled as non-social
play (unoccupied, solitary, and onlooker) and three
categorized as social play (parallel, associative, and
Source
cooperative). Table 4.4 describes each type of play.
Younger children engage in non-social play more
than those older; by age five associative and cooperative play are the most common forms of
play (Dyer & Moneta, 2006).

Description

Unoccupied Play

Children’s behavior seems more random and without a specific
goal. This is the least common form of play.
Children play by themselves, do not interact with others, nor are
they engaging in similar activities as the children around them.
Children are observing other children playing. They may comment
on the activities and even make suggestions but will not directly
join the play.
Children play alongside each other, using similar toys, but do not
directly act with each other.
Children will interact with each other and share toys but are not
working toward a common goal.
Children are interacting to achieve a common goal. Children may
take on different tasks to reach that goal.

Box 4.2 Imaginary Companions
An intriguing occurrence in early childhood is the
emergence of imaginary companions.
Researchers differ in how they define what
qualifies as an imaginary companion. Some
studies include only invisible characters that the
child refers to in conversation or plays with for an
extended period of time. Other researchers also
include objects that the child personifies, such as
a stuffed toy or doll, or characters the child
impersonates every day. Estimates of the number
of children who have imaginary companions
varies greatly (from as little as 6% to as high as
65%) depending on what is included in the
definition (Gleason, Sebanc, & Hartup, 2000).

Figure 4.25

Little is known about why children create
imaginary companions, and more than half of all
companions have no obvious trigger in the child’s life (Masih, 1978). Imaginary companions are
sometimes based on real people, characters from stories, or simply names the child has heard (Gleason,
et. al., 2000). Imaginary companions often change over time. In their study, Gleason et al. (2000)
found that 40% of the imaginary companions of the children they studied changed, such as developing
superpowers, switching age, gender, or even dying, and 68% of the characteristics of the companion
were acquired over time. This could reflect greater complexity in the child’s “creation” over time
and/or a greater willingness to talk about their imaginary playmates.
In addition, research suggests that contrary to the assumption that children with imaginary companions
are compensating for poor social skills, several studies have found that these children are very sociable
(Mauro, 1991; Singer & Singer, 1990; Gleason, 2002). However, studies have reported that children
with imaginary companions are more likely to be first-borns or only-children (Masih, 1978; Gleason et
al., 2000, Gleason, 2002). Although not all research has found a link between birth order and the
incidence of imaginary playmates (Manosevitz, Prentice, & Wilson, 1973). Moreover, some studies
have found little or no difference in the presence of imaginary companions and parental divorce
(Gleason et al., 2000), number of people in the home, or the amount of time children are spending with
real playmates (Masih, 1978; Gleason & Hohmann, 2006).
Do children treat real friends differently? The answer appears to be not really. Young children view
their relationship with their imaginary companion to be as supportive and nurturing as with their real
friends. Gleason has suggested that this might suggest that children form a schema of what is a friend
and use this same schema in their interactions with both types of friends (Gleason, et al., 2000;
Gleason, 2002; Gleason & Hohmann, 2006).

Children and the Media
Children view far more television today than in the
1960s; so much that they have been referred to as
Figure 4.26
Generation M for Media. Almost all American
families have at least one TV set, and half own
three or more (Nielsen Company, 2009). For
children age six and under, two-thirds watch
television every day, usually for two hours
(Rideout & Hamel, 2006). Even when involved in
other activities, such as playing, there is often a
television on nearby (Christakis, 2009; Kirkorian,
Pempek, & Murphy, 2009). Research has
consistently shown that too much television
adversely affects children’s behavior, health, and
Source
achievement (Gentile & Walsh, 2002; Robinson,
Wilde, & Navracruz, 2001). Young children are
less able to focus on active, hands-on play while the television is on, and background TV can
negatively affect cognitive and language development as well as be linked to attention problems
later in childhood (Schmidt, Pempek, & Kirkorian, 2008; Courage, Murphy, & Goulding, 2010).
An additional concern is the amount of screen time children are getting with smart mobile
devices. While most parents believe that their young children use mobile devices for a variety of
activities, the children report that they typically use them to play games (Chiong & Schuler,
2010). Studies have reported that young children who have two or more hours per day using
mobile devices show more externalizing behaviors (aggression, tantrums) and inattention
(Tamana, et al., 2019), shorter sleep durations and a higher risk of behavioral problems (Wu,
2017), and fail to meet developmental milestones in fine and gross motor skills, language, and
problem-solving (Madigan, Browne, Racine, Mori, & Tough, 2019).
Based on research findings, the AAP (2016) suggests that prior to the age of two children should
be engaged in hands-on exploration and social interaction with the real world, rather than the
virtual one. The immaturity of the cognitive functions in infants and toddlers make it difficult
for them to learn from digital media as effectively as they can from caregivers. For instance, it is
often not until 24 months of age that children can learn new words from live-video chatting
(Kirkorian, Choi, & Pempek, 2016). Between the ages of 2 and 5 the AAP (2016) suggests that
children should be limited to no more than one hour per day of high quality programs that are coviewed with a caregiver to help children to understand what they are viewing. The AAP also
strongly suggest that parents should avoid using mobile media to soothe their children. The
concern is that using media as a strategy to distract or soothe the child may make it difficult for
parents to limit the child’s use of the devices and may inhibit children’s ability to self-regulate
their own emotions.

Child Care
In 2018, about 71.5% of mothers of school-aged and 65.1%
Figure 4.27 U.S.
percent of mothers of preschool aged children in the United
Mothers’ Time Spent in
States worked outside the home (Bureau of Labor Statistics,
Child Care 1965-2012
2019). Since more women have been entering the workplace,
there has been a concern that families do not spend as much time
with their children. This, however, is not true. The Economist
Data Team (2017) analyzed data from of ten countries (United
States, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Denmark, Italy,
Netherlands, Slovenia and Spain) and estimated that the average
mother spent 54 minutes a day caring for children in 1965, but
104 minutes in 2012. Only mothers in France spent last time in
2012 than in 1965. Men continue to do less than women at 59
minutes per day in 2012, but they provided more care than in
Source
1965 when they averaged only 16 minutes a day. However,
differences were found between working-class and middle-class
mothers. In 1965 mothers with and without a university education spent about the same amount
of time on child care. By 2012 the more educated ones were spending half an hour more per
day. See Figure 4.27 for the difference between mothers in the United States who were
university educated (dark blue line) and those who were non-university educated (light blue
line).
To evaluate how early child care affects children’s development, the National Institute of Child
Health and Human Development (2006) conducted a longitudinal study. This study is considered
the most comprehensive child care study to date, and it began in 1991 when the children were
one month of age. The study included an economically and ethnically diverse group of 1364
children assessed from 10 sites around the country. By design the study involved single parents,
minority backgrounds, and differing formal education levels. Child care was defined as “any
care provided on a regular basis by someone other than the child’s mother” (p. 4). A regular
basis included more than 10 hours per week. Child care arrangements included: Care from the
father or another relative, care from a caregiver not related to the child in the child’s home, small
group care in the caregiver’s home, and center-based care.
Overall results indicated that children cared for by their mothers did not develop differently than
those who were cared for by others. Parents and family characteristics were stronger predictors
of child development than child care facilities. Specifically, greater cognitive, language and
social competence were demonstrated when parents were more educated, had higher incomes,
and provided emotionally supportive and cognitively enriched home environments. When
comparing higher quality child care with lower quality child care differences were noted. Higher
quality care, as measured by adult-to-child ratios, group size, and caregivers’ educational and
training levels, resulted in higher cognitive performance, better language comprehension and
production, and higher levels of school readiness. Lower quality care predicted more behavioral
problems and poorer cognitive, language, and school readiness.

150

The higher the teacher to child ratio, the
more time the teacher has for
involvement with the children and the
less stressed the teacher may be so that
the interactions can be more relaxed,
stimulating and positive. The more
children there are in a program, the less
desirable the program as well. This is
because the center may be more rigid in
rules and structure to accommodate the
large number of children in the
facility. The physical environment
should be colorful, stimulating, clean,
and safe. The philosophy of the
organization and the curriculum
Source
available should be child-centered,
positive, and stimulating. Providers
should be trained in early childhood education as well. A majority of states do not require
training for their child care providers. While formal education is not required for a person to
provide a warm, loving relationship to a child, knowledge of a child’s development is useful for
addressing their social, emotional, and cognitive needs in an effective way.
Figure 4.28

By working toward improving the quality of childcare and increasing family-friendly workplace
policies, such as more flexible scheduling and childcare facilities at places of employment, we
can accommodate families with smaller children and relieve parents of the stress sometimes
associated with managing work and family life.

Child Abuse
The Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (United States Department of Health and Human
Services, 2013) defines Child Abuse and Neglect as: Any recent act or failure to act on the part
of a parent or caretaker which results in death, serious physical or emotional harm, sexual
abuse or exploitation; or an act or failure to act, which presents an imminent risk of serious
harm (p. viii). Each state has its own definition of child abuse based on the federal law, and most
states recognize four major types of maltreatment: neglect, physical abuse, psychological
maltreatment, and sexual abuse. Each of the forms of child maltreatment may be identified alone,
but they can occur in combination.
Victims of Child Abuse: According to the United States Department of Health and Human
Services (HHS) (2019), during 2017 (the most recent year data has been collected) Child
Protective Services (CPS) agencies received an estimated 4.1 million referrals for abuse
involving approximately 7.5 million children. This is a rate of 31.8 per 1,000 children in the
national population. Professionals made 65.7% of alleged child abuse and neglect reports, and
they included law enforcement (18.3%), educational (19.4%) and social services personnel
(11.7%). Nonprofessionals, such as friends, neighbors, and relatives, submitted 17.3% of the
reports. Approximately 3.5 million children were the subjects of at least one report.
151

Victims in their first year of life had the highest rate of victimization (25.3 per 1,000 children of
the same age). The majority of victims consisted of three ethnicities: White (44.6%), Hispanic
(22.3%), and African-American (20.7%). The greatest percentages of children suffered from
neglect (74.9%) and physical abuse (18.3%), although a child may have suffered from multiple
forms of maltreatment. In 2017 an estimated 1,720 children died from abuse and neglect, and
71.8% of all child fatalities were younger than 3 years old. Boys had a higher child fatality rate
(2.68 per 100,000 boys), while girls died of abuse and neglect at a rate of 2.02 per 100,000 girls.
More than 88% of child fatalities were comprised of White (41.9%), African-American (31.5%),
and Hispanic (15.1%) victims (HHS, 2019).
Sexual Abuse: Childhood sexual abuse is defined as any sexual contact between a child and an
adult or a much older child. Incest refers to sexual contact between a child and family
members. In each of these cases, the child is exploited by an older person without regard for the
child's developmental immaturity and inability to understand the sexual behavior (Steele,
1986). Research estimates that 1 out of 4 girls and 1 out of 10 boys have been sexually abused
(Valente, 2005). The median age for sexual abuse is 8 or 9 years for both boys and girls
(Finkelhorn, Hotaling, Lewis, & Smith, 1990). Most boys and girls are sexually abused by a
male. Although rates of sexual abuse are higher for girls than for boys, boys may be less likely to
report abuse because of the cultural expectation that boys should be able to take care of
themselves and because of the stigma attached to homosexual encounters (Finkelhorn et al.,
1990). Girls are more likely to be abused by family member and boys by strangers. Sexual abuse
can create feelings of self-blame, betrayal, shame and guilt (Valente, 2005). Sexual abuse is
particularly damaging when the perpetrator is someone the child trusts and may lead to
depression, anxiety, problems with intimacy, and suicide (Valente, 2005).
Stress on Young Children: Children experience different types of stressors. Normal, everyday
stress can provide an opportunity for young children to build coping skills and poses little risk to
development. Even more long-lasting stressful events, such as changing schools or losing a
loved one, can be managed fairly well. Children who experience toxic stress or who live in
extremely stressful situations of abuse over long periods of time can suffer long-lasting
effects. The structures in the midbrain or limbic system, such as the hippocampus and amygdala,
can be vulnerable to prolonged stress during early childhood (Middlebrooks & Audage,
2008). High levels of the stress hormone cortisol can reduce the size of the hippocampus and
affect the child's memory abilities. Stress hormones can also reduce immunity to disease. The
brain exposed to long periods of severe stress can develop a low threshold making the child
hypersensitive to stress in the future.

Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs)
The toxic stress that young children endure can have a significant impact on their later lives.
According to Merrick, Ford, Ports, and Guinn (2018), the foundation for lifelong health and
well-being is created in childhood, as positive experiences strengthen biological systems while
adverse experiences can increase mortality and morbidity. All types of abuse, neglect, and other
potentially traumatic experiences that occur before the age of 18 are referred to as adverse
childhood experiences (ACEs) (CDC, 2019). ACEs have been linked to risky behaviors,
chronic health conditions, low life potential and early death, and as the number of ACEs
increase, so does the risk for these results.
152

Figure 4.29

When a child experiences strong, frequent, and/or prolonged adversity without adequate adult
support, the child’s stress response systems can be activated and disrupt the development of the
brain and other organ systems (Harvard University, 2019). Further, ACEs can increase the risk
for stress-related disease and cognitive impairment, well into the adult years. Felitti et al. (1998)
found that those who had experienced four or more ACEs compared to those who had
experienced none, had increased health risks for alcoholism, drug abuse, depression, suicide
attempt, increase in smoking, poor self-rated health, more sexually transmitted diseases, an
increase in physical inactivity and severe obesity. More ACEs showed an increased relationship
to the presence of adult diseases including heart disease, cancer, chronic lung disease, skeletal
fractures, and liver disease. Overall, those with multiple ACEs were likely to have multiple
health risk factors later in life.

153

Figure 4.30 How ACES Affect Children and Adults

Source

Some groups have been found to be at a greater risk for experiencing ACEs. Merrick et al.
(2018) reviewed the results from the 2011-2014 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System,
which included an ACE module consisting of questions adapted from the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention. Each question was collapsed into one of the eight ACE categories:
physical abuse, emotional abuse, sexual abuse, household mental illness, household substance
use, household domestic violence, incarcerated household member, and parental separation or
divorce. The results indicated that 25% of the sample had been exposed to three or more ACEs,
and although ACEs were found across all demographic groups, those who identified as Black,
multiracial, lesbian/gay/bisexual, having less than a high school education, being low income,
and unemployed experienced significantly higher ACE exposure. Assisting families and
providing children with supportive and responsive adults can help prevent the negative effects of
ACEs.

Separating Families at the United States
Figure 4.31 Children in a Detention Center
Border: Thousands of children were
separated from their parents beginning in
April 2018 as they approached the United
States border by Immigration and Custom
Enforcement (ICE). Children were placed in
separate facilities from their parents when
they were being processed, and they were not
told when they would be reunited. When
enduring stressful situations, separation from
one’s parents can be extremely detrimental to
a child (Society for Research in Child
Development (SRCD), 2018). Parental
separations affect children’s stress
management systems by changing how the
Source
body responds to stress. Long-term stress
can disrupt brain functioning, cognitive
skills, emotional processing, and physiological health. When exposed to stress, children
typically look to their parents for support and care, and parents can reduce children’s stress.
These separated children were already under extreme stress escaping their previous homes, and
then were separated from the individuals who could support them through this process.
Stress from parent separation places children at a higher risk for anxiety, depression, PTSD,
lower IQ, obesity, impaired immune system functioning, and medical conditions (SRCD, 2018).
Even after being reunited, children can experience attachment issues, poorer self-esteem, and
physical and psychological health difficulties. As they age, they continue to exhibit an increased
risk for mental health problems, problems in social interactions, difficulty with adult
attachments, poorer stress management, and an increased risk for death. The American
Psychological Association (2019) opposes policies that separate families given the negative
outcomes suffered by children.

Chapter 5: Middle and Late Childhood
Middle and late childhood spans the ages between early childhood and adolescence,
approximately ages 6 to 11. Children gain greater control over the movement of their bodies,
mastering many gross and fine motor skills that eluded the younger child. Changes in the brain
during this age enable not only physical development but contributes to greater reasoning and
flexibility of thought. School becomes a big part of middle and late childhood, and it expands
their world beyond the boundaries of their own family. Peers start to take center-stage, often
prompting changes in the parent-child relationship. Peer acceptance also influences children’s
perception of self and may have consequences for emotional development beyond these years.

Learning Objectives: Physical Development in Middle and Late Childhood
•
•
•
•
•

Summarize the overall physical growth
Describe the changes in brain maturation
Describe the positive effects of sports
Describe reasons for a lack of participation in youth sports
Explain current trends regarding being overweight in childhood, the negative
consequences of excess weight, the lack of recognition of being overweight, and
interventions to normalize weight

Physical Development
Overall Physical Growth: Rates of growth generally slow during these years. Typically, a child
will gain about 5-7 pounds a year and grow about 2-3 inches per year (CDC, 2000). They also
tend to slim down and gain muscle strength and lung capacity making it possible to engage in
strenuous physical activity for long periods of time. The beginning of the growth spurt, which
occurs prior to puberty, begins two years earlier for females than males. The mean age for the
beginning of the growth spurt for girls is nine, while for boys it is eleven. Children of this age
tend to sharpen their abilities to perform both gross motor skills, such as riding a bike, and fine
motor skills, such as cutting their fingernails. In gross motor skills (involving large muscles)
boys typically outperform girls, while with fine motor skills (small muscles) girls outperform the
boys. These improvements in motor skills are related to brain growth and experience during this
developmental period.
Brain Growth: Two major brain growth spurts occur during middle/late childhood (Spreen,
Riser, & Edgell, 1995). Between ages 6 and 8, significant improvements in fine motor skills and
eye-hand coordination are noted. Then between 10 and 12 years of age, the frontal lobes become
more developed and improvements in logic, planning, and memory are evident (van der Molen &
Molenaar, 1994). Myelination is one factor responsible for these growths. From age 6 to 12, the
nerve cells in the association areas of the brain, that is those areas where sensory, motor, and
intellectual functioning connect, become almost completely myelinated (Johnson, 2005). This
myelination contributes to increases in information processing speed and the child’s reaction
164

time. The hippocampus, responsible for transferring information from the short-term to longterm memory, also show increases in myelination resulting in improvements in memory
functioning (Rolls, 2000). Children in middle to late childhood are also better able to plan,
coordinate activity using both left and right hemispheres of the brain, and to control emotional
outbursts. Paying attention is also improved as the prefrontal cortex matures (Markant &
Thomas, 2013).

Sports
Middle childhood seems to be a great time to
introduce children to organized sports, and in
fact, many parents do. Nearly 3 million
children play soccer in the United States
(United States Youth Soccer, 2012). This
activity promises to help children build social
skills, improve athletically and learn a sense
of competition. However, it has been
suggested that the emphasis on competition
and athletic skill can be counterproductive and
lead children to grow tired of the game and
want to quit. In many respects, it appears that
children's activities are no longer children's
activities once adults become involved and
Source
approach the games as adults rather than
children. The U. S. Soccer Federation recently advised coaches to reduce the amount of drilling
engaged in during practice and to allow children to play more freely and to choose their own
positions. The hope is that this will build on their love of the game and foster their natural
talents.
Figure 5.1

Sports are important for children. Children’s participation in sports has been linked to:
•
•
•

Higher levels of satisfaction with family and overall quality of life in children
Improved physical and emotional development
Better academic performance

Yet, a study on children’s sports in the United States (Sabo & Veliz, 2008) has found that
gender, poverty, location, ethnicity, and disability can limit opportunities to engage in sports.
Girls were more likely to have never participated in any type of sport (see Figure 5.2). They also
found that fathers may not be providing their daughters as much support as they do their sons.
While boys rated their fathers as their biggest mentor who taught them the most about sports,
girls rated coaches and physical education teachers as their key mentors. Sabo and Veliz also
found that children in suburban neighborhoods had a much higher participation of sports than
boys and girls living in rural or urban centers. In addition, Caucasian girls and boys participated
in organized sports at higher rates than minority children (see Figure 5.3).

Finally, Sabo and Veliz asked children who had dropped out of organized sports why they left.
For both girls and boys, the number one answer was that it was no longer any fun (see Table
5.1). According to the Sport Policy and Research Collaborative (SPARC) (2013), almost 1 in 3
children drop out of organized sports, and while there are many factors involved in the decisions
to drop out, one suggestion has been the lack of training that coaches of children’s sports receive
may be contributing to this attrition (Barnett, Smoll & Smith, 1992). Several studies have found
that when coaches receive proper training, the drop-out rate is about 5% instead of the usual 30%
(Fraser-Thomas, Côté, & Deakin, 2005; SPARC, 2013).

Welcome to the world of esports: According to Discover Esports (2017), esports is a form of
competition with the medium being video games. Players use computers or specific video game
consoles to play video games against each other. In addition to playing themselves, children my
just watch others play the video games. The recent SPARC (2016) report on the “State of Play”
in the United States highlights a disturbing trend. One in four children between the ages of 5 and
16 rate playing computer games with their friends as a form of exercise. Over half of males and
about 20% of females, aged 12-19, say they are fans of esports.
Since 2008 there has also been a downward trend in the number of sports children are engaged
in, despite a body of research evidence that suggests that specializing in only one activity can
increase the chances of injury, while playing multiple sports is protective (SPARC, 2016). A
University of Wisconsin study found that 49% of athletes who specialized in a sport experienced
an injury compared with 23% of those who played multiple sports (McGuine, 2016).
Physical Education: For many children, physical education in school is a key component in
introducing children to sports. After years of schools cutting back on physical education
programs, there has been a turn around, prompted by concerns over childhood obesity and the
related health issues. Despite these changes, currently only the state of Oregon and the District
of Columbia meet PE guidelines of a minimum of 150 minutes per week of physical activity in
elementary school and 225 minutes in middle school (SPARC, 2016).

167

Childhood Obesity
The decreased participation in school physical education and youth sports is just one of many
factors that has led to an increase in children being overweight or obese. The current
measurement for determining excess weight is the Body Mass Index (BMI) which expresses the
relationship of height to weight. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC), children’s whose BMI is at or above the 85th percentile for their age are considered
overweight, while children who are at or above the 95th percentile are considered obese (Lu,
2016). In 2015-2016 approximately 13.9% of 2-5 year-olds and 18.4% of 6-11 year-olds were
obese (Hales, Carroll, Fryar, & Ogden, 2017). Excess weight and obesity in children are
associated with a variety of medical and cognitive conditions including high blood pressure,
insulin resistance, inflammation, depression, and lower academic achievement (Lu, 2016).
Being overweight has also been linked to
Figure 5.4 Being overweight can be a
impaired brain functioning, which includes
lifelong struggle
deficits in executive functioning, working
memory, mental flexibility, and decision
making (Liang, Matheson, Kaye, &
Boutelle, 2014). Children who ate more
saturated fats performed worse on relational
memory tasks, while eating a diet high in
omega-3 fatty acids promoted relational
memory skills (Davidson, 2014). Using
animal studies Davidson et al. (2013) found
that large amounts of processed sugars and
saturated fat weakened the blood-brain
Source
barrier, especially in the hippocampus. This
can make the brain more vulnerable to
harmful substances that can impair its functioning. Another important executive functioning
skill is controlling impulses and delaying gratification. Children who are overweight show less
inhibitory control than normal weight children, which may make it more difficult for them to
avoid unhealthy foods (Lu, 2016). Overall, being overweight as a child increases the risk for
cognitive decline as one ages.
A growing concern is the lack of recognition from parents that children are overweight or obese.
Katz (2015) referred to this as oblivobesity. Black, Park and Gregson (2015) found that parents
in the United Kingdom (UK) only recognized their children as obese when they were above the
99.7th percentile while the official cut-off for obesity is at the 85th percentile. Oude Luttikhuis,
Stolk, and Sauer (2010) surveyed 439 parents and found that 75% of parents of overweight
children said the child had a normal weight and 50% of parents of obese children said the child
had a normal weight. For these parents, overweight was considered normal and obesity was
considered normal or a little heavy. Doolen, Alpert, and Miller (2009) reported on several studies
from the United Kingdom, Australia, Italy, and the United States, and in all locations, parents
were more likely to misperceive their children’s weight. Black et al. (2015) concluded that as the
average weight of children rises, what parents consider normal also rises. Needless to say, if
parents cannot identify if their children are overweight they will not be able to intervene and
assist their children with proper weight management.
168

An added concern is that the children themselves are not accurately identifying if they are
overweight. In a United States sample of 8-15 year-olds, more than 80% of overweight boys and
70% of overweight girls misperceived their weight as normal (Sarafrazi, Hughes, & Borrud,
2014). Also noted was that as the socioeconomic status of the children rose, the frequency of
these misconceptions decreased. It appeared that families with more resources were more
conscious of what defines a healthy weight.
Children who are overweight tend to be rejected, ridiculed, teased and bullied by others
(Stopbullying.gov, 2018). This can certainly be damaging to their self-image and popularity. In
addition, obese children run the risk of suffering orthopedic problems such as knee injuries, and
they have an increased risk of heart disease and stroke in adulthood (Lu, 2016). It is hard for a
child who is obese to become a non-obese adult. In addition, the number of cases of pediatric
diabetes has risen dramatically in recent years.
Behavioral interventions, including
training children to overcome impulsive
behavior, are being researched to help
overweight children (Lu, 2016).
Practicing inhibition has been shown to
strengthen the ability to resist unhealthy
foods. Parents can help their
overweight children the best when they
are warm and supportive without using
shame or guilt. Parents can also act like
the child’s frontal lobe until it is
developed by helping them make
correct food choices and praising their
efforts (Liang, et al., 2014). Research
also shows that exercise, especially
Source
aerobic exercise, can help improve
cognitive functioning in overweight
children (Lu, 2016). Parents should take caution against emphasizing diet alone to avoid the
development of any obsession about dieting that can lead to eating disorders. Instead, increasing
a child's activity level is most helpful.
Figure 5.5

In 2018 the American Psychological Association (APA) developed a clinical practice guideline
that recommends family-based, multicomponent behavioral interventions to treat obesity and
overweight in children 2 to 18 (Weir, 2019). The guidelines recommend counseling on diet,
physical activity and “teaching parents strategies for goal setting, problem-solving, monitoring
children’s behaviors, and modeling positive parental behaviors,” (p. 32). Early research results
have shown success using this model compared to controls. Because there is no quick fix for
weight loss, the program recommends 26 contact hours with the family. Unfortunately, for many
families cost, location, and time commitment make it difficult for them to receive the
interventions. APA has recommended that behavioral treatment could be delivered in primary
care offices to encourage greater particiapation. APA also recommend that schools and
communities need to offer more nutritious meals to children and limit sodas and unhealthy foods.

Recall from the last chapter that children in early childhood are in Piaget’s preoperational stage,
and during this stage, children are learning to think symbolically about the world. Cognitive
skills continue to expand in middle and late childhood as thought processes become more logical
and organized when dealing with concrete information. Children at this age understand concepts
such as past, present, and future, giving them the ability to plan and work toward goals.
Additionally, they can process complex ideas such as addition and subtraction and cause-andeffect relationships.

Concrete Operational Thought
From ages 7 to 11, children are in what Piaget referred to as the concrete operational stage of
cognitive development (Crain, 2005). This involves mastering the use of logic in concrete ways.
The word concrete refers to that which is tangible; that which can be seen, touched, or
experienced directly. The concrete operational child is able to make use of logical principles in
solving problems involving the physical world. For example, the child can understand
principles of cause and effect, size, and distance.
The child can use logic to solve problems tied to their own direct experience, but has trouble
solving hypothetical problems or considering more abstract problems. The child uses inductive
reasoning, which is a logical process in which multiple premises believed to be true are
combined to obtain a specific conclusion. For example, a child has one friend who is rude,
another friend who is also rude, and the same is true for a third friend. The child may conclude
that friends are rude. We will see that this way of thinking tends to change during adolescence
being replaced with deductive reasoning. We will now explore some of the major abilities that
the concrete child exhibits.

170

Classification: As children's
experiences and vocabularies grow,
they build schemata and are able to
organize objects in many different
ways. They also understand
classification hierarchies and can
arrange objects into a variety of
classes and subclasses.
Identity: One feature of concrete
operational thought is the
understanding that objects have
qualities that do not change even if
the object is altered in some
way. For instance, mass of an object
does not change by rearranging it. A
piece of chalk is still chalk even
when the piece is broken in two.

Figure 5.6 Children in the concrete operational
stage understand how to classify organisms

Source

Reversibility: The child learns that some things that have been changed can be returned to
their original state. Water can be frozen and then thawed to become liquid again, but eggs
cannot be unscrambled. Arithmetic operations are reversible as well: 2 + 3 = 5 and 5 – 3 =
2. Many of these cognitive skills are incorporated into the school's curriculum through
mathematical problems and in worksheets about which situations are reversible or irreversible.
Conservation: Remember the example in our last chapter of preoperational children thinking
that a tall beaker filled with 8 ounces of water was "more" than a short, wide bowl filled with 8
ounces of water? Concrete operational children can understand the concept of conservation
which means that changing one quality (in this example, height or water level) can be
compensated for by changes in another quality (width). Consequently, there is the same amount
of water in each container, although one is taller and narrower and the other is shorter and wider.
Decentration: Concrete operational children no longer focus on only one dimension of any
object (such as the height of the glass) and instead consider the changes in other dimensions too
(such as the width of the glass). This allows for conservation to occur.
Seriation: Arranging items along a quantitative dimension, such as length or weight, in a
methodical way is now demonstrated by the concrete operational child. For example, they can
methodically arrange a series of different-sized sticks in order by length, while younger children
approach a similar task in a haphazard way.
These new cognitive skills increase the child's understanding of the physical world, however
according to Piaget, they still cannot think in abstract ways. Additionally, they do not think in
systematic scientific ways. For example, when asked which variables influence the period that a
pendulum takes to complete its arc and given weights they can attach to strings in order to do

171

experiments, most children younger than 12 perform biased experiments from which no
conclusions can be drawn (Inhelder & Piaget, 1958).

Information Processing
Children differ in their memory abilities, and these differences predict both their readiness for
school and academic performance in school (PreBler, Krajewski, & Hasselhorn, 2013). During
middle and late childhood children make strides in several areas of cognitive function including
the capacity of working memory, their ability to pay attention, and their use of memory
strategies. Both changes in the brain and experience foster these abilities.
Working Memory: The capacity of working memory expands during middle and late childhood,
and research has suggested that both an increase in processing speed and the ability to inhibit
irrelevant information from entering memory are contributing to the greater efficiency of
working memory during this age (de Ribaupierre, 2002). Changes in myelination and synaptic
pruning in the cortex are likely behind the increase in processing speed and ability to filter out
irrelevant stimuli (Kail, McBride-Chang, Ferrer, Cho, & Shu, 2013).
Children with learning disabilities in math and reading often have difficulties with working
memory (Alloway, 2009). They may struggle with following the directions of an assignment.
When a task calls for multiple steps, children with poor working memory may miss steps
because they may lose track of where they are in the task. Adults working with such children
may need to communicate: Using more familiar vocabulary, using shorter sentences, repeating
task instructions more frequently, and breaking more complex tasks into smaller more
manageable steps. Some studies have also shown that more intensive training of working
memory strategies, such as chunking, aid in improving the capacity of working memory in
children with poor working memory (Alloway, Bibile, & Lau, 2013).
Attention: As noted above, the ability to inhibit irrelevant information improves during this age
group, with there being a sharp improvement in selective attention from age six into adolescence
(Vakil, Blachstein, Sheinman, & Greenstein, 2009). Children also improve in their ability to
shift their attention between tasks or different features of a task (Carlson, Zelazo, & Faja, 2013).
A younger child who is asked to sort objects into piles based on type of object, car versus animal,
or color of object, red versus blue, may have difficulty if you switch from asking them to sort
based on type to now having them sort based on color. This requires them to suppress the prior
sorting rule. An older child has less difficulty making the switch, meaning there is greater
flexibility in their attentional skills. These changes in attention and working memory contribute
to children having more strategic approaches to challenging tasks.
Memory Strategies: Bjorklund (2005) describes a developmental progression in the acquisition
and use of memory strategies. Such strategies are often lacking in younger children but increase
in frequency as children progress through elementary school. Examples of memory strategies
include rehearsing information you wish to recall, visualizing and organizing information,
creating rhymes, such “i” before “e” except after “c”, or inventing acronyms, such as “roygbiv”
to remember the colors of the rainbow. Schneider, Kron-Sperl, and Hünnerkopf (2009) reported
a steady increase in the use of memory strategies from ages six to ten in their longitudinal study
(see Table 5.2). Moreover, by age ten many children were using two or more memory strategies
172

to help them recall information. Schneider and
colleagues found that there were considerable
individual differences at each age in the use of
strategies, and that children who utilized more
strategies had better memory performance than their
same aged peers.

Children may experience three deficiencies in their
use of memory strategies. A mediation deficiency
occurs when a child does not grasp the strategy
being taught, and thus, does not benefit from its use.
If you do not understand why using an acronym
might be helpful, or how to create an acronym, the strategy is not likely to help you. In a
production deficiency the child does not spontaneously use a memory strategy and must be
prompted to do so. In this case, children know the strategy and are more than capable of using it,
but they fail to “produce” the strategy on their own. For example, children might know how to
make a list, but may fail to do this to help them remember what to bring on a family vacation. A
utilization deficiency refers to children using an appropriate strategy, but it fails to aid their
performance. Utilization deficiency is common in the early stages of learning a new memory
strategy (Schneider & Pressley, 1997; Miller, 2000). Until the use of the strategy becomes
automatic it may slow down the learning process, as space is taken up in memory by the strategy
itself. Initially, children may get frustrated because their memory performance may seem worse
when they try to use the new strategy. Once children become more adept at using the strategy,
their memory performance will improve. Sodian and Schneider (1999) found that new memory
strategies acquired prior to age eight often show utilization deficiencies with there being a
gradual improvement in the child’s use of the strategy. In contrast, strategies acquired after this
age often followed an “all-or-nothing” principle in which improvement was not gradual, but
abrupt.
Knowledge Base: During middle and late childhood, children are able to learn and remember
due to an improvement in the ways they attend to and store information. As children enter school
and learn more about the world, they develop more categories for concepts and learn more
efficient strategies for storing and retrieving information. One significant reason is that they
continue to have more experiences on which to tie new information. In other words, their
knowledge base, knowledge in particular areas that makes learning new information easier,
expands (Berger, 2014).
Metacognition: Children in middle and late childhood also have a better understanding of how
well they are performing a task, and the level of difficulty of a task. As they become more
realistic about their abilities, they can adapt studying strategies to meet those needs. Young
children spend as much time on an unimportant aspect of a problem as they do on the main point,
while older children start to learn to prioritize and gauge what is significant and what is not. As a
result, they develop metacognition. Metacognition refers to the knowledge we have about our
own thinking and our ability to use this awareness to regulate our own cognitive processes
(Bruning, Schraw, Norby, & Ronning, 2004).

173

Critical Thinking: According to Bruning et al. (2004) there is a debate in U.S. education as to
whether schools should teach students what to think or how to think. Critical thinking, or a
detailed examination of beliefs, courses of action, and evidence, involves teaching children how
to think. The purpose of critical thinking is to evaluate information in ways that help us make
informed decisions. Critical thinking involves better understanding a problem through gathering,
evaluating, and selecting information, and also by considering many possible solutions. Ennis
(1987) identified several skills useful in critical thinking. These include: Analyzing arguments,
clarifying information, judging the credibility of a source, making value judgements, and
deciding on an action. Metacognition is essential to critical thinking because it allows us to
reflect on the information as we make decisions.

Language Development
Vocabulary: One of the reasons that children can classify objects in so many ways is that they
have acquired a vocabulary to do so. By fifth grade, a child's vocabulary has grown to 40,000
words. It grows at a rate that exceeds that of those in early childhood. This language explosion,
however, differs from that of younger children because it is facilitated by being able to associate
new words with those already known, and because it is accompanied by a more sophisticated
understanding of the meanings of a word.
New Understanding: Those in middle and late childhood are also able to think of objects in less
literal ways. For example, if asked for the first word that comes to mind when one hears the word
"pizza", the younger child is likely to say "eat" or some word that describes what is done with a
pizza. However, the older child is more likely to place pizza in the appropriate category and say
"food". This sophistication of vocabulary is also evidenced by the fact that older children tell
jokes and delight in doing do. They may use jokes that involve plays on words such as "knockknock" jokes or jokes with punch lines. Young children do not understand play on words and tell
"jokes" that are literal or slapstick, such as "A man fell down in the mud! Isn't that funny?"
Grammar and Flexibility: Older children are also able to learn new rules of grammar with
more flexibility. While younger children are likely to be reluctant to give up saying "I goed
there", older children will learn this rather quickly along with other rules of grammar.

Communication Disorders
At the end of early childhood, children are often assessed in terms of their ability to speak
properly. By first grade, about 5% of children have a notable speech disorder (Medline Plus,
2016c).
Fluency disorders: Fluency disorders affect the rate of speech. Speech may be labored and
slow, or too fast for listeners to follow. The most common fluency disorder is stuttering.
Stuttering is a speech disorder in which sounds, syllables, or words are repeated or last longer
than normal. These problems cause a break in the flow of speech, which is called dysfluency
(Medline Plus, 2016b). About 5% of young children, aged two-five, will develop some
stuttering that may last from several weeks to several years (Medline Plus, 2016c).
Approximately 75% of children recover from stuttering. For the remaining 25%, stuttering can
174

persist as a lifelong communication disorder (National Institute on Deafness and other
Communication Disorders, NIDCD, 2016). This is called developmental stuttering and is the
most common form of stuttering. Brain injury, and in very rare instances, emotional trauma may
be other triggers for developing problems with stuttering. In most cases of developmental
stuttering, other family members share the same communication disorder. Researchers have
recently identified variants in four genes that are more commonly found in those who stutter
(NIDCD, 2016).
Articulation disorder: An articulation disorder refers to the inability to correctly produce
speech sounds (phonemes) because of imprecise placement, timing, pressure, speed, or flow of
movement of the lips, tongue, or throat (NIDCD, 2016). Sounds can be substituted, left off,
added or changed. These errors may make it hard for people to understand the speaker. They can
range from problems with specific sounds, such as lisping to severe impairment in the
phonological system. Most children have problems pronouncing words early on while their
speech is developing. However, by age three, at least half of what a child says should be
understood by a stranger. By age five, a child's speech should be mostly intelligible. Parents
should seek help if by age six the child is still having trouble producing certain sounds. It should
be noted that accents are not articulation disorders (Medline Plus, 2016a).
Voice disorders: Disorders of the voice involve problems with pitch, loudness, and quality of
the voice (American Speech-Language and Hearing Association, 2016). It only becomes a
disorder when problems with the voice makes the child unintelligible. In children, voice
disorders are significantly more prevalent in males than in females. Between 1.4% and 6% of
children experience problems with the quality of their voice. Causes can be due to structural
abnormalities in the vocal cords and/or larynx, functional factors, such as vocal fatigue from
overuse, and in rarer cases psychological factors, such as chronic stress and anxiety.

Theories of Intelligence
Figure 5.7 Alfred Binet

Psychologists have long debated how to best conceptualize and
measure intelligence (Sternberg, 2003). These questions include:
How many types of intelligence are there, the role of nature
versus nurture in intelligence, how intelligence is represented in
the brain, and the meaning of group differences in intelligence.

General (g) versus Specific (s) Intelligences: From 1904-1905
the French psychologist Alfred Binet (1857–1914) and his
colleague Théodore Simon (1872–1961) began working on
behalf of the French government to develop a measure that
would identify children who would not be successful with the
regular school curriculum. The goal was to help teachers better
educate these students (Aiken, 1994). Binet and Simon developed
Source
what most psychologists today regard as the first intelligence test,
which consisted of a wide variety of questions that included the ability to name objects, define
words, draw pictures, complete sentences, compare items, and construct sentences.
175

Binet and Simon (Binet, Simon, & Town, 1915; Siegler, 1992) believed that the questions
they asked the children all assessed the basic abilities to understand, reason, and make
judgments. It turned out that the correlations among these different types of measures were in
fact all positive; that is, students who got one item correct were more likely to also get other
items correct, even though the questions themselves were very different.
On the basis of these results, the psychologist Charles Spearman (1863–1945) hypothesized that
there must be a single underlying construct that all of these items measure. He called the
construct that the different abilities and skills measured on intelligence tests have in common the
General Intelligence Factor (g). Virtually all psychologists now believe that there is a
generalized intelligence factor, “g”, that relates to abstract thinking and that includes the abilities
to acquire knowledge, to reason abstractly, to adapt to novel situations, and to benefit from
instruction and experience (Gottfredson, 1997; Sternberg, 2003). People with higher general
intelligence learn faster.
Soon after Binet and Simon introduced their test, the American
psychologist Lewis Terman at Stanford University (1877–1956)
developed an American version of Binet’s test that became
known as the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Test. The StanfordBinet is a measure of general intelligence made up of a wide
variety of tasks, including vocabulary, memory for pictures,
naming of familiar objects, repeating sentences, and following
commands.

Although there is general agreement among psychologists that
“g” exists, there is also evidence for specific intelligence “s”,
a measure of specific skills in narrow domains. One empirical
result in support of the idea of “s” comes from intelligence
tests themselves. Although the different types of questions do
correlate with each other, some items correlate more highly
with each other than do other items; they form clusters or
clumps of intelligences.

Triarchic Theory: One advocate of the idea of multiple intelligences is the psychologist Robert
Sternberg. Sternberg has proposed a triarchic (three-part) theory of intelligence that proposes
that people may display more or less analytical intelligence, creative intelligence, and practical
intelligence. Sternberg (1985, 2003) argued that traditional intelligence tests assess analytical
intelligence, academic problem solving and performing calculations, but that they do not
typically assess creative intelligence, the ability to adapt to new situations and create new ideas,
and/or practical intelligence, the ability to demonstrate common sense and street-smarts.
As Sternberg proposed, research has found that creativity is not highly correlated with analytical
intelligence (Furnham & Bachtiar, 2008) and exceptionally creative scientists, artists,
mathematicians, and engineers do not score higher on intelligence than do their less, creative
peers (Simonton, 2000).

176

Furthermore, the brain areas that are associated with convergent
thinking, thinking that is directed toward finding the correct
answer to a given problem, are different from those associated
with divergent thinking, the ability to generate many different
ideas or solutions to a single problem (Tarasova, Volf, &
Razoumnikova, 2010). On the other hand, being creative often
takes some of the basic abilities measured by “g”, including the
abilities to learn from experience, to remember information, and to
think abstractly (Bink & Marsh, 2000). Ericsson (1998), Weisberg
(2006), Hennessey and Amabile (2010) and Simonton (1992)
studied creative people and identified at least five components that
are likely to be important for creativity as listed in Table 5.3

The last aspect of the triarchic model, practical intelligence, refers primarily to intelligence that
cannot be gained from books or formal learning. Practical intelligence represents a type of
“street smarts” or “common sense” that is learned from life experiences. Although a number of
tests have been devised to measure practical intelligence (Sternberg, Wagner, & Okagaki, 1993;
Wagner & Sternberg, 1985), research has not found much evidence that practical intelligence is
distinct from “g” or that it is predictive of success at any particular tasks (Gottfredson, 2003).
Practical intelligence may include, at least in part, certain abilities that help people perform well
at specific jobs, and these abilities may not always be highly correlated with general intelligence
(Sternberg et al., 1993).
Theory of Multiple Intelligences: Another champion of the idea of specific types of
intelligences rather than one overall intelligence is the psychologist Howard Gardner (1983,
1999). Gardner argued that it would be evolutionarily functional for different people to have
different talents and skills and proposed that there are eight intelligences that can be
differentiated from each other. A potential ninth intelligence; that is, existential still needs
empirical support. Gardner investigated intelligences by focusing on children who were talented
in one or more areas and adults who suffered from strokes that compromised some capacities,
but not others. Gardner also noted that some evidence for multiple intelligences comes from the
abilities of autistic savants, people who score low on intelligence tests overall, but who
nevertheless may have exceptional skills in a given domain, such as math, music, art, or in being
177

able to recite statistics in a given sport (Treffert & Wallace, 2004). In addition to brain damage
and the existence of savants, Gardner identified these 8 intelligences based on other criteria
including a set developmental history and psychometric findings. See Table 5.4 for a list of
Gardner’s eight specific intelligences.

The idea of multiple intelligences has
been influential in the field of
education, and teachers have used
these ideas to try to teach differently
to different students. For instance, to
teach math problems to students who
have particularly good kinesthetic
intelligence, a teacher might
encourage the students to move their
bodies or hands according to the
numbers. On the other hand, some
have argued that these “intelligences”
sometimes seem more like “abilities”
or “talents” rather than real
intelligence. There is no clear
conclusion about how many
intelligences there are. Are sense of
Figure 5.10 © Thinkstock
humor, artistic skills, dramatic skills,
and so forth also separate intelligences? Furthermore, and again demonstrating the underlying
178

power of a single intelligence, the many different intelligences are, in fact, correlated and thus
represent, in part, “g” (Brody, 2003).

Measuring Intelligence: Standardization and the Intelligence Quotient
The goal of most intelligence tests is to measure “g”, the general intelligence factor. Good
intelligence tests are reliable, meaning that they are consistent over time, and also demonstrate
validity, meaning that they actually measure intelligence rather than something else. Because
intelligence is such an important individual difference dimension, psychologists have invested
substantial effort in creating and improving measures of intelligence, and these tests are now
considered the most accurate of all psychological tests. In fact, the ability to accurately assess
intelligence is one of the most important contributions of psychology to everyday public life.
Intelligence changes with age. A 3-year-old who could accurately multiply 183 by 39 would
certainly be intelligent, but a 25-year-old who could not do so would be seen as unintelligent.
Thus, understanding intelligence requires that we know the norms or standards in a given
population of people at a given age. The standardization of a test involves giving it to a large
number of people at different ages and computing the average score on the test at each age
level.
It is important that intelligence tests be standardized on a regular basis, because the overall
level of intelligence in a population may change over time. The Flynn effect refers to the
observation that scores on intelligence tests worldwide have increased substantially over the
past decades (Flynn, 1999). Although the increase varies somewhat from country to country,
the average increase is about 3 IQ points every 10 years. There are many explanations for the
Flynn effect, including better nutrition, increased access to information, and more familiarity
with multiple-choice tests (Neisser, 1998). Whether people are actually getting smarter,
however, is debatable (Neisser, 1997). Most of the increase in IQ occurred during the second
half of the 20th century. Recent research has found a reversal of the Flynn effect in several
nations around the world, although some nations still show an increase in IQ scores (Dutton,
van der Linden, & Lynn, 2016).
Once the standardization has been accomplished, we have a picture of the average abilities of
people at different ages and can calculate a person’s mental age, which is the age at which a
person is performing intellectually. If we compare the mental age of a person to the person’s
chronological age, the result is the Intelligence Quotient (IQ), a measure of intelligence that is
adjusted for age. A simple way to calculate IQ is by using the following formula:
IQ = mental age ÷ chronological age × 100.
Thus a 10-year-old child who does as well as the average 10-year-old child has an IQ of 100 (10
÷ 10 × 100), whereas an 8-year-old child who does as well as the average 10-year-old child
would have an IQ of 125 (10 ÷ 8 × 100). Most modern intelligence tests are based on the
relative position of a person’s score among people of the same age, rather than on the basis of
this formula, but the idea of an intelligence “ratio” or “quotient” provides a good description of
the score’s meaning.
179

Wechsler Scales: A number of scales are based on the IQ. The Wechsler Adult lntelligence
Scale (WAIS) is the most widely used intelligence test for adults (Watkins, Campbell,
Nieberding, & Hallmark, 1995). The current version of the WAIS, the WAIS-IV, was
standardized on 2,200 people ranging from 16 to 90 years of age. It consists of 15 different tasks,
each designed to assess intelligence, including working memory, arithmetic ability, spatial
ability, and general knowledge about the world. The WAIS-IV yield scores on four domains:
verbal, perceptual, working memory, and processing speed. The reliability of the test is high
(more than 0.95), and it shows substantial construct validity. The WAIS-IV is correlated highly
with other IQ tests such as the Stanford-Binet, as well as with criteria of academic and life
success, including college grades, measures of work performance, and occupational level. It also
shows significant correlations with measures of everyday functioning among people with
intellectual disabilities.
The Wechsler scale has also been adapted for preschool children in the form of the Wechsler
Primary and Preschool Scale of Intelligence-Fourth Edition (WPPSI-IV) and for older children
and adolescents in the form of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fifth Edition
(WISC-V). Figure 5.11 illustrates items from the WAIS.

Bias: Intelligence tests and psychological definitions of intelligence have been heavily criticized
since the 1970s for being biased in favor of Anglo-American, middle-class respondents and for
being inadequate tools for measuring non-academic types of intelligence or talent. Intelligence
changes with experience, and intelligence quotients or scores do not reflect that ability to
change. What is considered smart varies culturally as well, and most intelligence tests do not
take this variation into account. For example, in the West, being smart is associated with being
quick. A person who answers a question the fastest is seen as the smartest, but in some cultures
being smart is associated with considering an idea thoroughly before giving an answer. A wellthought out, contemplative answer is the best answer.

180

Extremes of Intelligence: Intellectual Disability and Giftedness
The results of studies assessing the measurement of intelligence show that IQ is distributed in the
population in the form of a normal distribution (or bell curve), which is the pattern of scores
usually observed in a variable that clusters around its average. In a normal distribution, the bulk
of the scores fall toward the middle, with fewer scores falling at the extremes. The normal
distribution of intelligence shows that on IQ tests, as well as on most other measures, the majority
of people cluster around the average (in this case, where IQ = 100), and fewer are either very
smart or very dull (see Figure 5.13). Because the standard deviation of an IQ test is about 15,
this means that about 2% of people score above an IQ of 130, often considered the threshold for
giftedness, and about the same percentage score below an IQ of 70, often being considered the
threshold for an intellectual disability.
Although Figure 5.12 presents a single distribution, the actual IQ distribution varies by sex such
that the distribution for men is more spread out than is the distribution for women. These sex
differences mean that about 20% more men than women fall in the extreme (very smart or very
dull) ends of the distribution (Johnson, Carothers, & Deary, 2009). Boys are about five times
more likely to be diagnosed with the reading disability dyslexia than are girls (Halpern, 1992),
and are also more likely to be classified as having an intellectual disability. However, boys are
also about 20% more highly represented in the upper end of the IQ distribution.
Figure 5.12 Distribution of IQ Scores in the General Population

The normal distribution of IQ scores in the general population shows that most people have about average
intelligence, while very few have extremely high or extremely low intelligence.

One end of the distribution of intelligence scores is defined by people with very low IQ.
Intellectual disability (or intellectual developmental disorder) is assessed based on cognitive
capacity (IQ) and adaptive functioning. The severity of the disability is based on adaptive
functioning, or how well the person handles everyday life tasks. About 1% of the United States
population, most of them males, fulfill the criteria for intellectual developmental disorder, but
some children who are given this diagnosis lose the classification as they get older and better
learn to function in society. A particular vulnerability of people with low IQ is that they may be
taken advantage of by others, and this is an important aspect of the definition of intellectual
developmental disorder (Greenspan, Loughlin, & Black, 2001).
181

One cause of intellectual developmental disorder is Down syndrome, a chromosomal disorder
caused by the presence of all or part of an extra 21st chromosome. The incidence of Down
syndrome is estimated at approximately 1 per 700 births, and the prevalence increases as the
mother’s age increases (CDC, 2014). People with Down syndrome typically exhibit a distinctive
pattern of physical features, including a flat nose, upwardly slanted eyes, a protruding tongue, and
a short neck (see Figure 5.14).

Fortunately, societal attitudes toward
individuals with intellectual
disabilities have changed over the
past decades. Laws such as the
Americans with Disabilities Act
(ADA) have made it illegal to
discriminate on the basis of mental
and physical disability, and there has
been a trend to bring people with
intellectual disabilities out of
institutions and into our workplaces
and schools.

Giftedness refers to children who have an IQ of 130 or higher (Lally & Valentine-French, 2015).
Having extremely high IQ is clearly less of a problem than having extremely low IQ, but there
may also be challenges to being particularly smart. It is often assumed that schoolchildren who
are labeled as “gifted” may have adjustment problems that make it more difficult for them to
create social relationships. To study gifted children, Lewis Terman and his colleagues (Terman &
Oden, 1959) selected about 1,500 high school students who scored in the top 1% on the
Stanford-Binet and similar IQ tests (i.e., who had IQs of about 135 or higher), and tracked them
for more than seven decades (the children became known as the “termites” and are still being
studied today). This study found that these students were not unhealthy or poorly adjusted, but
rather were above average in physical health and were taller and heavier than individuals in the
general population. The students also had above average social relationships and were less likely
to divorce than the average person (Seagoe, 1975).

Figure 5.14

The popular stereotype of highly
intelligent people as physically
uncoordinated and unpopular is not true.

Terman’s study also found that many of these students
went on to achieve high levels of education and entered
prestigious professions, including medicine, law, and
science. Of the sample, 7% earned doctoral degrees, 4%
earned medical degrees, and 6% earned law degrees.
These numbers are all considerably higher than what
would have been expected from a more general
population. Another study of young adolescents who had
even higher IQs found that these students ended up
attending graduate school at a rate more than 50 times
higher than that in the general population (Lubinski &
Benbow, 2006).

182

As you might expect based on our discussion of intelligence, kids who are gifted have higher
scores on general intelligence “g”, but there are also different types of giftedness. Some children
are particularly good at math or science, some at automobile repair or carpentry, some at music
or art, some at sports or leadership, and so on. There is a lively debate among scholars about
whether it is appropriate or beneficial to label some children as “gifted and talented” in school
and to provide them with accelerated special classes and other programs that are not available to
everyone. Although doing so may help the gifted kids (Colangelo & Assouline, 2009), it also
may isolate them from their peers and make such provisions unavailable to those who are not
classified as “gifted.”

Education
Remember the ecological systems model (Bronfenbrenner, 1979) that we explored in chapter
one? This model helps us understand an individual by examining the contexts in which the
person lives and the direct and indirect influences on that person's life. School becomes a very
important component of children's lives during middle and late childhood, and parents and the
culture contribute to children’s experiences in school as indicated by the ecological systems
model through their interaction with the school.
Gender: The stereotypes held by parents and teachers can influence children’s self-efficacy in
various domains. For example, teachers who hold the view that girls are better at reading
(Retelsdorf, Schwartz, & Asbrock, 2015) or boys are better at math (Plante, de la Sablonnière,
Aronson, & Théorêt, 2013) often find that their students’ performance in these areas mirror these
stereotypes, despite the children’s actual ability, or the ability of children in the classrooms of
teachers who do not hold such stereotypes. While not all children will internalize the views of
others, those who do are more likely to show declines in their performance consistent with the
stereotypes (Plante, et al., 2013; Retelsdorf et al., 2015).
Parental Involvement in School: Parents vary in their level of involvement with their children's
schools. Teachers often complain that they have difficulty getting parents to participate in their
child's education and devise a variety of techniques to keep parents in touch with daily and
overall progress. For example, parents may be required to sign a behavior chart each evening to
be returned to school or may be given information about the school's events through websites
and newsletters. There are other factors that need to be considered when looking at parental
involvement. To explore these, first ask yourself if all parents who enter the school with
concerns about their child be received in the same way?
Horvat (2004) found that teachers seek a particular type of involvement from particular types of
parents. While teachers thought they were open and neutral in their responses to parental
involvement, in reality teachers were most receptive to support, praise and agreement coming
from parents who were most similar in race and social class with the teachers. Parents who
criticized the school or its policies were less likely to be given voice. Parents who have higher
levels of income, occupational status, and other qualities favored in society have family capital.
This is a form of power that can be used to improve a child's education. Parents who do not have
these qualities may find it more difficult to be effectively involved. The authors suggest that
teachers closely examine their biases against parents. Schools may also need to examine their
183

ability to dialogue with parents about school policies in more open ways. Any efforts to improve
effective parental involvement should address these concerns.

Cultural Differences in the Classroom
Bilingualism: In 2013, approximately 20% of school aged
children and adolescents spoke a language other than English in
the home (Camarota & Zeigler, 2014). The majority of bilingual
students speak Spanish, but the rest represent more than three
hundred different language groups from around the world. In larger
communities throughout the United States, it is therefore common
for a single classroom to contain students from several language
backgrounds at once. In classrooms, as in other social settings,
bilingualism exists in different forms and degrees. At one extreme
are students who speak both English and another language
fluently; at the other extreme are those who speak only limited
versions of both languages. In between are students who speak
their home (or heritage) language much better than English, as well
Source
as others who have partially lost their heritage language in the
process of learning English (Tse, 2001). Commonly, a student may
speak a language satisfactorily, but be challenged by reading or writing it. Whatever the case,
each bilingual student poses unique challenges to teachers.
Figure 5.15

The student who speaks both languages fluently has a definite cognitive advantage. As you
might suspect, and research confirms, a fully fluent bilingual student is in a better position to
express concepts or ideas in more than one way, and to be aware of doing so (Jimenez, Garcia, &
Pearson, 1995; Francis, 2006). Unfortunately, the bilingualism of many students is unbalanced in
the sense that they are either still learning English, or else they have lost some earlier ability to
use their original, heritage language. Losing one’s original language is a concern as research
finds that language loss limits students' ability to learn English as well or as quickly as they
could do. Having a large vocabulary in a first language has been shown to save time in learning
vocabulary in a second language (Hansen, Umeda & McKinney, 2002). Preserving the first
language is important if a student has impaired skill in all languages and therefore needs
intervention or help from a speech-language specialist. Research has found, in such cases, that
the specialist can be more effective if the specialist speaks and uses the first language as well as
English (Kohnert, Yim, Nett, Kan, & Duran, 2005).
Cultures and ethnic groups differ not only in languages, but also in how languages are used.
Since some of the patterns differ from those typical of modern classrooms, they can create
misunderstandings between teachers and students (Cazden, 2001; Rogers, et al., 2005). Consider
these examples:

184

Figure 5.16 How do Classrooms Accommodate Different Cultures?

Source

•

In some cultures, it is considered polite or even intelligent not to speak unless you have
something truly important to say. Chitchat, or talk that simply affirms a personal tie
between people, is considered immature or intrusive (Minami, 2002). In a classroom, this
habit can make it easier for a child to learn not to interrupt others, but it can also make the
child seem unfriendly.

•

Eye contact varies by culture. In many African American and Latin American
communities, it is considered appropriate and respectful for a child not to look directly at
an adult who is speaking to them (Torres-Guzman, 1998). In classrooms, however,
teachers often expect a lot of eye contact (as in “I want all eyes on me!”) and may be
tempted to construe lack of eye contact as a sign of indifference or disrespect.

•

Social distance varies by culture. In some cultures, it is common to stand relatively close
when having a conversation; in others, it is more customary to stand relatively far apart
(Beaulieu, 2004). Problems may happen when a teacher and a student prefer different
social distances. A student who expects a closer distance than does the teacher may seem
overly familiar or intrusive, whereas one who expects a longer distance may seem overly
formal or hesitant.

185

•

Wait time varies by culture. Wait time is the gap between the end of one person's
comment or question and the next person's reply or answer. In some cultures wait time is
relatively long, as long as three or four seconds (Tharp & Gallimore, 1989). In others it is
a negative gap, meaning that it is acceptable, even expected, for a person to interrupt
before the end of the previous comment. In classrooms the wait time is customarily about
one second; after that, the teacher is likely to move on to another question or to another
student. A student who habitually expects a wait time longer than one second may seem
hesitant, and not be given many chances to speak. A student who expects a negative wait
time, on the other hand, may seem overeager or even rude.

•

In most non-Anglo cultures, questions are intended to gain information, and it is assumed
that a person asking the question truly does not have the information requested (Rogoff,
2003). In most classrooms, however, teachers regularly ask test questions, which are
questions to which the teacher already knows the answer and that simply assess whether a
student knows the answer as well (Macbeth, 2003). The question: “How much is 2 + 2?”
for example, is a test question. If the student is not aware of this purpose, he or she may
become confused, or think that the teacher is surprisingly ignorant. Worse yet, the student
may feel that the teacher is trying deliberately to shame the student by revealing the
student's ignorance or incompetence to others.

•

Preference for activities that are cooperative
rather than competitive. Many activities in
Figure 5.17
school are competitive, even when teachers
try to de-emphasize the competition. Once
past the first year or second year of school,
students often become attentive to who
receives the highest marks on an
assignment, for example, or who is the best
athlete at various sports or whose
contributions to class discussions gets the
most verbal recognition from the teacher
(Johnson & Johnson, 1998). A teacher
deliberately organizes important activities or
assignments competitively, as in “Let’s see
Source
who finishes the math sheet first”.
Classroom life can then become explicitly
competitive, and the competitive atmosphere can interfere with cultivating supportive
relationships among students or between students and the teacher (Cohen, 2004). For
students who give priority to these relationships, competition can seem confusing at best
and threatening at worst. A student may wonder, “What sort of sharing or helping with
answers is allowed?” The answer to this question may be different depending on the
cultural background of the student and teacher. What the student views as cooperative
sharing may be seen by the teacher as laziness, freeloading, or even cheating.

Box 5.1 What happened to No Child Left Behind?
Children's academic performance is often measured with the use of standardized
tests. Achievement tests are used to measure what a child has already learned.
Achievement tests are often used as measures of teaching effectiveness within a school
setting and as a method to make schools that receive tax dollars (such as public schools,
charter schools, and private schools that receive vouchers) accountable to the government for
their performance. In 2001, President Bush signed into effect Public Law 107-110, better
known as the No Child Left Behind Act mandating that schools administer achievement
tests to students and publish those results so that parents have an idea of their children's
performance. Additionally, the government would have information on the gaps in
educational achievement between children from various social class, racial, and ethnic
groups. Schools that showed significant gaps in these levels of performance were mandated
to work toward narrowing these gaps. Educators criticized the policy for focusing too much
on testing as the only indication of student performance. Target goals were considered
unrealistic and set by the federal government rather than individual states. Because these
requirements became increasingly unworkable for schools, changes to the law were
requested. On December 12, 2015 President Obama signed into law Every Student
Succeeds Act (ESSA) (United States Department of Education, 2017). This law is state
driven and focuses on expanding educational opportunities and improving student outcomes,
including in the areas of high school graduation, drop-out rates, and college attendance.

Children with Disabilities
A Learning Disability (or LD) is a specific impairment of academic learning that interferes
with a specific aspect of schoolwork and that reduces a student's academic performance
significantly. A LD shows itself as a major discrepancy between a student's ability and some
feature of achievement: The student may be delayed in reading, writing, listening, speaking, or
doing mathematics, but not in all of these at once. A learning problem is not considered a
learning disability if it stems from physical, sensory, or motor handicaps, or from generalized
intellectual impairment. It is also not an LD if the learning problem really reflects the challenges
of learning English as a second language. Genuine LDs are the learning problems left over after
these other possibilities are accounted for or excluded. Typically, a student with an LD has not
been helped by teachers' ordinary efforts to assist the student when he or she falls behind
academically, though what counts as an “ordinary effort”, of course, differs among teachers,
schools, and students. Most importantly, though, an LD relates to a fairly specific area of
academic learning. A student may be able to read and compute well enough, for example, but not
be able to write. LDs are by far the most common form of special educational need, accounting
for half of all students with special needs in the United States and approximately 20% of all
students, depending on how the numbers are estimated (National Center for Learning
Disabilities, 2017). Students with LDs are so common, in fact, that most teachers regularly
encounter at least one per class in any given school year, regardless of the grade level they teach.
These difficulties are identified in school because this is when children's academic abilities are
being tested, compared, and measured. Consequently, once academic testing is no longer
187

essential in that person's life (as when they are working rather than going to school) these
disabilities may no longer be noticed or relevant, depending on the person's job and the extent of
the disability.
Dyslexia is one of the most commonly diagnosed disabilities and involves having difficulty in the
area of reading. This diagnosis is used for a number of reading difficulties. Common
characteristics are difficulty with phonological processing, which includes the manipulation of
sounds, spelling, and rapid visual/verbal processing. Additionally, the child may reverse letters,
have difficulty reading from left to right, or may have problems associating letters with sounds.
It appears to be rooted in neurological problems involving the parts of the brain active in
recognizing letters, verbally responding, or being able to manipulate sounds. Recent studies
have identified a number of genes that are linked to developing dyslexia (National Institute of
Neurological Disorders and Stroke, 2016). Treatment typically involves altering teaching
methods to accommodate the person's particular problematic area.
Dysgraphia refers to a writing disability that is often associated with dyslexia (Carlson, 2013).
There are different types of dysgraphia, including phonological dysgraphia when the person
cannot sound out words and write them phonetically. Orthographic dysgraphia is demonstrated
by those individuals who can spell regularly spelled words, but not irregularly spelled ones.
Some individuals with dysgraphia experience difficulties in motor control and experience trouble
forming letters when using a pen or pencil.

Dyscalculia refers to problems in math. Cowan
and Powell (2014) identified several terms used
when describing difficulties in mathematics
including dyscalculia, mathematical learning
disability, and mathematics disorder. All three
terms refer to students with average intelligence
who exhibit poor academic performance in
mathematics. When evaluating a group of third
graders, Cowan and Powell (2014) found that
children with dyscalculia demonstrated problems
with working memory, reasoning, processing
speed and oral language, all of which are referred
to as domain-general factors. Additionally,
problems with multi-digit skills, including number
system knowledge, were also exhibited.

A child with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) shows a constant pattern of
inattention and/or hyperactive and impulsive behavior that interferes with normal
functioning (American Psychological Association (APA), 2013). Some of the signs of
inattention include great difficulty with, and avoidance of, tasks that require sustained
attention (such as conversations or reading), failure to follow instructions (often resulting
in failure to complete school work and other duties), disorganization (difficulty keeping
things in order, poor time management, sloppy and messy work), lack of attention to detail,
becoming easily distracted, and forgetfulness. Hyperactivity is characterized by excessive
188

movement, and includes fidgeting or squirming, leaving one’s seat in situations when
remaining seated is expected, having trouble sitting still (e.g., in a restaurant), running
about and climbing on things, blurting out responses before another person’s question or
statement has been completed, difficulty waiting one’s turn for something, and interrupting
and intruding on others. Frequently, the hyperactive child comes across as noisy and
boisterous. The child’s behavior is hasty, impulsive, and seems to occur without much
forethought; these characteristics may explain why adolescents and young adults diagnosed
with ADHD receive more traffic tickets and have more automobile accidents than do others
their age (Thompson, Molina, Pelham, & Gnagy, 2007).
ADHD occurs in about 5% of children (APA,
2013). On the average, boys are 3 times more
likely to have ADHD than are girls;
however, such findings might reflect the
greater propensity of boys to engage in
aggressive and antisocial behavior and thus
incur a greater likelihood of being referred to
psychological clinics (Barkley, 2006).
Children with ADHD face severe academic
and social challenges. Compared to their
non-ADHD counterparts, children with
ADHD have lower grades and standardized
Source
test scores and higher rates of expulsion,
grade retention, and dropping out (Loe &
Feldman, 2007). They also are less well- liked and more often rejected by their peers (Hoza et al.,
2005).
Figure 5.19

ADHD can persist into adolescence and adulthood (Barkley, Fischer, Smallish, & Fletcher,
2002). A recent study found that 29.3% of adults who had been diagnosed with ADHD decades
earlier still showed symptoms (Barbaresi et al., 2013). Somewhat troubling, this study also
reported that nearly 81% of those whose ADHD persisted into adulthood had experienced at
least one other comorbid disorder, compared to 47% of those whose ADHD did not persist.
Additional concerns when an adult has ADHD include: Worse educational attainment, lower
socioeconomic status, less likely to be employed, more likely to be divorced, and more likely to
have non-alcohol-related substance abuse problems (Klein et al., 2012).
Etiology of ADHD: Family and twin studies indicate that genetics play a significant role in
the development of ADHD. Burt (2009), in a review of 26 studies, reported that the median
rate of concordance for identical twins was .66, whereas the median concordance rate for
fraternal twins was .20. The specific genes involved in ADHD are thought to include at
least two that are important in the regulation of the neurotransmitter dopamine (Gizer, Ficks,
& Waldman, 2009), suggesting that dopamine may be important in ADHD. Indeed,
medications used in the treatment of ADHD, such as methylphenidate (Ritalin) and
amphetamine with dextroamphetamine (Adderall), have stimulant qualities and elevate
dopamine activity. People with ADHD show less dopamine activity in key regions of the
brain, especially those associated with motivation and reward (Volkow et al., 2009), which
189

provides support to the theory that dopamine deficits may be a vital factor in the
development this disorder (Swanson et al., 2007).
Brain imaging studies have shown that children with ADHD exhibit abnormalities in their
frontal lobes, an area in which dopamine is in abundance. Compared to children without
ADHD, those with ADHD appear to have smaller frontal lobe volume, and they show less
frontal lobe activation when performing mental tasks (Banaschewski et al., 2017). Recall that
one of the functions of the frontal lobes is to inhibit our behavior. Thus, abnormalities in this
region may go a long way toward explaining the hyperactive, uncontrolled behavior of
ADHD.
Many parents attribute their child’s hyperactivity to sugar. A statistical review of 16
studies, however, concluded that sugar consumption has no effect at all on the behavioral
and cognitive performance of children (Wolraich, Wilson, & White, 1995). Additionally,
although food additives have been shown to increase hyperactivity in non-ADHD children,
the effect is rather small (McCann et al., 2007). Numerous studies, however, have shown a
significant relationship between exposure to nicotine in cigarette smoke during the prenatal
period and ADHD (Linnet et al., 2003; Sourander et al., 2019). Maternal smoking during
pregnancy is also associated with the development of more severe symptoms of the disorder
(Thakur et al., 2013). Additionally, low birth weight and prematurity have been correlated
with ADHD (Banaschewski et al., 2017).
Treatment for ADHD: Recommended treatment for ADHD includes behavioral interventions,
cognitive behavioral therapy, parent and teacher education, recreational programs, and lifestyle
changes, such as getting more sleep (Clay, 2013). For some children medication is prescribed.
Parents are often concerned that stimulant medication may result in their child acquiring a
substance use disorder. However, research using longitudinal studies has demonstrated that
children diagnosed with ADHD who received pharmacological treatment had a lower risk for
substance abuse problems than those children who did not receive medication (Wilens, Fararone,
Biederman, & Gunawardene, 2003). The risk of substance abuse problems appears to be even
greater for those with ADHD who are un-medicated and also exhibit antisocial tendencies
(Marshal & Molina, 2006).
Is the prevalence rate of ADHD increasing? Many people believe that the rates of ADHD
have increased in recent years, and there is evidence to support this contention. In a recent
study, investigators found that the parent-reported prevalence of ADHD among children (4–17
years old) in the United States increased by 22% during a 4-year period, from 7.8% in 2003 to
9.5% in 2007 (CDC, 2010). ADHD may be over-diagnosed by doctors who are too quick to
medicate children as a behavior treatment. There is also greater awareness of ADHD now than
in the past. Nearly everyone has heard of ADHD, and most parents and teachers are aware of its
key symptoms. Thus, parents may be quick to take their children to a doctor if they believe
their child possesses these symptoms, or teachers may be more likely now than in the past to
notice the symptoms and refer the child for evaluation. Further, the use of computers, video
games, iPhones, and other electronic devices has become pervasive among children in the
early 21st century, and these devices could potentially shorten children’s attentions spans.

190

Thus, what might seem like inattention to some parents and teachers could simply reflect
exposure to too much technology.

Children with Disabilities: Legislation
Since the 1970s political and social attitudes have moved increasingly toward including people
with disabilities into a wide variety of “regular” activities. In the United States, the shift is
illustrated clearly in the Federal legislation that was enacted during this time. Three major laws
were passed that guaranteed the rights of persons with disabilities, and of children and students
with disabilities in particular. The third law has had the biggest impact on education.
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Section 504: This law, the first of its kind, required that individuals
with disabilities be accommodated in any program or activity that receives Federal funding (PL
93-112, 1973). Although this law was not intended specifically for education, in practice it has
protected students' rights in some extra-curricular activities (for older students) and in some child
care or after-school care programs (for younger students). If those programs receive Federal
funding of any kind, the programs are not allowed to exclude children or youths with disabilities,
and they have to find reasonable ways to accommodate the individuals' disabilities.
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (or ADA): This legislation also prohibited
discrimination on the basis of disability, just as Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act had done
(PL 101-336, 1990). Although the ADA also applies to all people (not just to students), its
provisions are more specific and “stronger” than those of Section 504. In particular, ADA
extends to all employment and jobs, not just those receiving Federal funding. It also specifically
requires accommodations to be made in public facilities such as with buses, restrooms, and
telephones. ADA legislation is therefore responsible for some of the “minor” renovations in
schools that you may have noticed in recent years, like wheelchair-accessible doors, ramps, and
restrooms, and public telephones with volume controls.
Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (or IDEA): As its name implied, this legislation
was more focused on education than either Section 504 or ADA. It was first passed in 1975,
reauthorized in 2004 (PL 108-446, 2004), and most recently amended in 2015 through Public
Law 114-95, as the Every Student Succeeds Act (United States Department of Education, 2017).
In its current form, the law guarantees the following rights related to education for anyone with a
disability from birth to age 21. The first two influence schooling in general, but the last three
affect the work of classroom teachers rather directly:
•

Free, appropriate education: An individual or an individual's family should not have to
pay for education simply because the individual has a disability, and the educational
program should be truly educational; i.e., not merely care-taking or babysitting the
person.

•

Due process: In case of disagreements between an individual with a disability and the
schools or other professionals, there must be procedures for resolving the disagreements
that are fair and accessible to all parties, including the person himself or herself or the
person's representative.
191

•

Fair evaluation of performance in spite of disability: Tests or other evaluations should
not assume test taking skills that a person with a disability cannot reasonably be expected
to have, such as holding a pencil, hearing or seeing questions, working quickly, or
understanding and speaking orally. Evaluation procedures should be modified to allow
for these differences. This provision of the law applies both to evaluations made by
teachers and to school-wide or “high-stakes” testing programs.

•

Education in the “least restrictive environment”: Education for someone with a
disability should provide as many educational opportunities and options for the person as
possible, both in the short term and in the long term. In practice this requirement has
meant including students in regular classrooms and school activities as much as possible,
though often not totally.

•

An individualized educational program (IEP): Given that every disability is unique,
instructional planning for a person with a disability should be unique or individualized as
well. In practice this provision has led to classroom teachers planning individualized
programs jointly with other professionals (like reading specialists, psychologists, or
medical personnel) as part of a team.

Evaluation and diagnosis can be the first step in helping provide children with disabilities the
type of instruction and resources that will benefit them educationally, but diagnosis and labeling
also have social implications. It is important to consider that children can be misdiagnosed and
that once a child has received a diagnostic label, the child, teachers, and family members may
tend to interpret actions of the child through that label. The label can also influence the child's
self-concept. Consider, for example, a child who is misdiagnosed as learning disabled. That child
may expect to have difficulties in school, lack confidence, and because of these expectations
experience trouble. This self-fulfilling prophecy or tendency to act in such a way as to make
what you predict will happen, will come true.
This calls our attention to the power that labels can have whether or not they are accurately
applied. It is also important to consider that children's difficulties can change over time; a child
who has problems in school, may improve later or may live under circumstances as an adult
where the problem (such as a delay in math skills or reading skills) is no longer relevant. That
person, however, will still have a label as learning disabled. It should be recognized that the
distinction between abnormal and normal behavior is not always clear; some abnormal behavior
in children is fairly common.

Erikson: Industry vs. Inferiority
According to Erikson, children in middle and late childhood are very busy or industrious
(Erikson, 1982). They are constantly doing, planning, playing, getting together with friends, and
achieving. This is a very active time, and a time when they are gaining a sense of how they
measure up when compared with peers. Erikson believed that if these industrious children can be
successful in their endeavors, they will get a sense of confidence for future challenges. If not, a
sense of inferiority can be particularly haunting during middle and late childhood.

Self-Understanding
Self-concept refers to beliefs about general personal identity (Seiffert, 2011). These beliefs
include personal attributes, such as one’s age, physical characteristics, behaviors, and
competencies. Children in middle and late childhood have a more realistic sense of self than do
those in early childhood, and they better understand their strengths and weaknesses. This can be
attributed to greater experience in comparing their own performance with that of others, and to
greater cognitive flexibility. Children in middle and late childhood are also able to include other
peoples’ appraisals of them into their self-concept, including parents, teachers, peers, culture,
and media. Internalizing others’ appraisals and creating social comparison affect children’s selfesteem, which is defined as an evaluation of one’s identity. Children can have individual
assessments of how well they perform a variety of activities and also develop an overall global
self-assessment. If there is a discrepancy between how children view themselves and what they
consider to be their ideal selves, their self-esteem can be negatively affected.

193

Another important development in selfunderstanding is self-efficacy, which is the
belief that you are capable of carrying out a
specific task or of reaching a specific goal
(Bandura, 1977, 1986, 1997). Large
discrepancies between self-efficacy and
ability can create motivational problems for
the individual (Seifert, 2011). If a student
believes that he or she can solve
mathematical problems, then the student is
more likely to attempt the mathematics
homework that the teacher assigns.
Unfortunately, the converse is also true. If a
student believes that he or she is incapable
of math, then the student is less likely to
Source
attempt the math homework regardless of
the student's actual ability in math. Since
self-efficacy is self-constructed, it is possible for students to miscalculate or misperceive their
true skill, and these misperceptions can have complex effects on students' motivations. It is
possible to have either too much or too little self-efficacy, and according to Bandura (1997) the
optimum level seems to be either at, or slightly above, true ability.
Figure 5.20 Hopefully these children have
self-efficacy about playing the violin

Kohlberg’s Stages of Moral Development
Kohlberg (1963) built on the work of Piaget and was interested in finding out how our moral
reasoning changes as we get older. He wanted to find out how people decide what is right and
what is wrong. Just as Piaget believed that children’s cognitive development follows specific
patterns, Kohlberg (1984) argued that we learn our moral values through active thinking and
reasoning, and that moral development follows a series of stages. Kohlberg's six stages are
generally organized into three levels of moral reasons. To study moral development, Kohlberg
posed moral dilemmas to children, teenagers, and adults, such as the following:
A man’s wife is dying of cancer and there is only one drug that can save her. The only
place to get the drug is at the store of a pharmacist who is known to overcharge people
for drugs. The man can only pay $1,000, but the pharmacist wants $2,000, and refuses to
sell it to him for less, or to let him pay later. Desperate, the man later breaks into the
pharmacy and steals the medicine. Should he have done that? Was it right or wrong?
Why? (Kohlberg, 1984)
Level One-Preconventional Morality: In stage one, moral reasoning is based on concepts of
punishment. The child believes that if the consequence for an action is punishment, then the
action was wrong. In the second stage, the child bases his or her thinking on self-interest and
reward. "You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours." The youngest subjects seemed to answer
based on what would happen to the man as a result of the act. For example, they might say the
man should not break into the pharmacy because the pharmacist might find him and beat him. Or
they might say that the man should break in and steal the drug and his wife will give him a big
194

kiss. Right or wrong, both decisions were based on what would physically happen to the man as
a result of the act. This is a self-centered approach to moral decision-making. He called this
most superficial understanding of right and wrong preconventional morality. Preconventional
morality focuses on self-interest. Punishment is avoided, and rewards are sought. Adults can
also fall into these stages, particularly when they are under pressure.
Level Two-Conventional Morality: Those tested who based their answers on what other
people would think of the man as a result of his act, were placed in Level Two. For instance, they
might say he should break into the store, and then everyone would think he was a good husband,
or he should not because it is against the law. In either case, right and wrong is determined by
what other people think. In stage three, the person wants to please others. At stage four, the
person acknowledges the importance of social norms or laws and wants to be a good member of
the group or society. A good decision is one that gains the approval of others or one that
complies with the law. This he called conventional morality, people care about the effect of
their actions on others. Some older children, adolescents, and adults use this reasoning.
Level Three-Postconventional Morality: Right and wrong are based on social contracts
established for the good of everyone and that can transcend the self and social convention. For
example, the man should break into the store because, even if it is against the law, the wife needs
the drug and her life is more important than the consequences the man might face for breaking
the law. Alternatively, the man should not violate the principle of the right of property because
this rule is essential for social order. In either case, the person's judgment goes beyond what
happens to the self. It is based on a concern for others; for society as a whole, or for an ethical
standard rather than a legal standard. This level is called postconventional moral development
because it goes beyond convention or what other people think to a higher, universal ethical
principle of conduct that may or may not be reflected in the law. Notice that such thinking is the
kind Supreme Court justices do all day when deliberating whether a law is moral or ethical,
which requires being able to think abstractly. Often this is not accomplished until a person
reaches adolescence or adulthood. In the fifth stage, laws are recognized as social contracts. The
reasons for the laws, like justice, equality, and dignity, are used to evaluate decisions and
interpret laws. In the sixth stage, individually determined universal ethical principles are weighed
to make moral decisions. Kohlberg said that few people ever reach this stage. The six stages can
be reviewed in Table 5.6.
Although research has supported Kohlberg’s idea that moral reasoning changes from an early
emphasis on punishment and social rules and regulations to an emphasis on more general ethical
principles, as with Piaget’s approach, Kohlberg’s stage model is probably too simple. For one,
people may use higher levels of reasoning for some types of problems but revert to lower levels
in situations where doing so is more consistent with their goals or beliefs (Rest, 1979). Second, it
has been argued that the stage model is particularly appropriate for Western, rather than nonWestern, samples in which allegiance to social norms, such as respect for authority, may be
particularly important (Haidt, 2001). In addition, there is frequently little correlation between
how we score on the moral stages and how we behave in real life.

Perhaps the most important critique of Kohlberg’s theory is that it may describe the moral
development of males better than it describes that of females. Gilligan (1982) has argued that,
because of differences in their socialization, males tend to value principles of justice and rights,
whereas females value caring for and helping others. Although there is little evidence for a
gender difference in Kohlberg’s stages of moral development (Turiel, 1998), it is true that girls
and women tend to focus more on issues of caring, helping, and connecting with others than do
boys and men (Jaffee & Hyde, 2000).

Friends and Peers
As toddlers, children may begin to show a preference for certain playmates (Ross & Lollis,
1989). However, peer interactions at this age often involve more parallel play rather than
intentional social interactions (Pettit, Clawson, Dodge, & Bates, 1996). By age four, many
children use the word “friend” when referring to certain children and do so with a fair degree of
stability (Hartup, 1983). However, among young children “friendship” is often based on
proximity, such as they live next door, attend the same school, or it refers to whomever they just
happen to be playing with at the time (Rubin, 1980).

196

Friendships take on new importance as judges of
Figure 5.21
one's worth, competence, and attractiveness in
middle and late childhood. Friendships provide the
opportunity for learning social skills, such as how to
communicate with others and how to negotiate
differences. Children get ideas from one another
about how to perform certain tasks, how to gain
popularity, what to wear or say, and how to act. This
society of children marks a transition from a life
focused on the family to a life concerned with
peers. During middle and late childhood, peers
increasingly play an important role. For example,
Source
peers play a key role in a child's self-esteem at this
age as any parent who has tried to console a rejected
child will tell you. No matter how complimentary and encouraging the parent may be, being
rejected by friends can only be remedied by renewed acceptance. Children’s conceptualization of
what makes someone a “friend” changes from a more egocentric understanding to one based on
mutual trust and commitment. Both Bigelow (1977) and Selman (1980) believe that these
changes are linked to advances in cognitive development.
Bigelow and La Gaipa (1975) outline three stages to children’s
conceptualization of friendship.
Source
In stage one, reward-cost, friendship focuses on mutual activities. Children in early, middle,
and late childhood all emphasize similar interests as the main characteristics of a good friend.
Stage two, normative expectation focuses on conventional morality; that is, the emphasis is on
a friend as someone who is kind and shares with you. Clark and Bittle (1992) found that fifth
graders emphasized this in a friend more than third or eighth graders. In the final stage,
empathy and understanding, friends are people who are loyal, committed to the relationship,
and share intimate information. Clark and Bittle (1992) reported eighth graders emphasized this
more in a friend. They also found that as early as fifth grade, girls were starting to include a
sharing of secrets, and not betraying confidences as crucial to someone who is a friend.
Selman (1980) outlines five stages of friendship from early childhood through to adulthood:
•

Momentary physical interaction, a friend is someone who you are playing with at this
point in time. Selman notes that this is typical of children between the ages of three and
six. These early friendships are based more on circumstances (e.g., a neighbor) than on
genuine similarities.

•

One-way assistance, a friend is someone who does nice things for you, such as saving
you a seat on the school bus or sharing a toy. However, children in this stage, do not
always think about what they are contributing to the relationships. Nonetheless, having
a friend is important and children will sometimes put up with a not so nice friend, just to
have a friend. Children as young as five and as old as nine may be in this stage.

•

Fair-weather cooperation, children are very concerned with fairness and reciprocity,
and thus, a friend is someone returns a favor. In this stage, if a child does something
197

nice for a friend there is an expectation that the friend will do something nice for them
at the first available opportunity. When this fails to happen, a child may break off the
friendship. Selman found that some children as young as seven and as old as twelve are
in this stage.
•

Intimate and mutual sharing, typically between the ages of eight and fifteen, a friend
is someone who you can tell them things you would tell no one else. Children and teens
in this stage no longer “keep score” and do things for a friend because they genuinely
care for the person. If a friendship dissolves in the stage it is usually due to a violation
of trust. However, children in this stage do expect their friend to share similar interests
and viewpoints and may take it as a betrayal if a friend likes someone that they do not.

•

Autonomous interdependence, a friend is someone who accepts you and that you
accept as they are. In this stage children, teens, and adults accept and even appreciate
differences between themselves and their friends. They are also not as possessive, so
they are less likely to feel threatened if their friends have other relationships or interests.
Children are typically twelve or older in this stage.

Peer Relationships: Sociometric assessment measures attraction between members of a group,
such as a classroom of students. In sociometric research children are asked to mention the three
children they like to play with the most, and those they do not like to play with. The number of
times a child is nominated for each of the two categories (like, do not like) is tabulated. Popular
children receive many votes in the “like” category, and very few in the “do not like” category.
In contrast, rejected children receive more unfavorable votes, and few favorable ones.
Controversial children are mentioned frequently in each category, with several children liking
them and several children placing them in the do not like category. Neglected children are
rarely mentioned in either category, and the average child has a few positive votes with very few
negative ones (Asher & Hymel, 1981).
Most children want to be liked and accepted by their
Figure 5.22 Withdrawn
friends. Some popular children are nice and have good social
children are targets for
skills. These popular-prosocial children tend to do well in school
bullies
and are cooperative and friendly. Popular-antisocial children
may gain popularity by acting tough or spreading rumors about
others (Cillessen & Mayeux, 2004). Rejected children are
sometimes excluded because they are rejected-withdrawn.
These children are shy and withdrawn and are easy targets for
bullies because they are unlikely to retaliate when belittled
(Boulton, 1999). Other rejected children are rejected-aggressive
and are ostracized because they are aggressive, loud, and
confrontational. The aggressive-rejected children may be acting
out of a feeling of insecurity. Unfortunately, their fear of rejection
only leads to behavior that brings further rejection from other
children. Children who are not accepted are more likely to
Source
experience conflict, lack confidence, and have trouble adjusting
(Klima & Repetti, 2008; Schwartz, Lansford, Dodge, Pettit, & Bates, 2014).
198

Long-Term Consequences of Popularity: Childhood popularity researcher Mitch Prinstein has
found that likability in childhood leads to positive outcomes throughout one’s life (as cited in
Reid, 2017). Adults who were accepted in childhood have stronger marriages and work
relationships, earn more money, and have better health outcomes than those who were
unpopular. Further, those who were unpopular as children, experienced greater anxiety,
depression, substance use, obesity, physical health problems and suicide. Prinstein found that a
significant consequence of unpopularity was that children were denied opportunities to build
their social skills and negotiate complex interactions, thus contributing to their continued
unpopularity. Further, biological effects can occur due to unpopularity, as social rejection can
activate genes that lead to an inflammatory response.

Bullying
According to Stopbullying.gov (2016), a federal government website managed by the U.S.
Department of Health & Human Services, bullying is defined as unwanted, aggressive behavior
among school aged children that involves a real or perceived power imbalance. Further, the
aggressive behavior happens more than once or has the potential to be repeated. There are
different types of bullying, including verbal bullying, which is saying or writing mean things,
teasing, name calling, taunting, threatening, or making inappropriate sexual comments. Social
bullying, also referred to as relational bullying, involves spreading rumors, purposefully
excluding someone from a group, or embarrassing someone on purpose. Physical Bullying
involves hurting a person’s body or possessions.
A more recent form of bullying is cyberbullying, which involves electronic technology.
Examples of cyberbullying include sending mean text messages or emails, creating fake profiles,
and posting embarrassing pictures, videos or rumors on social networking sites. Children who
experience cyberbullying have a harder time getting away from the behavior because it can occur
any time of day and without being in the presence of others. Additional concerns of
cyberbullying include that messages and images can be posted anonymously, distributed quickly,
and be difficult to trace or delete. Children who are cyberbullied are more likely to: experience
in-person bullying, be unwilling to attend school, receive poor grades, use alcohol and drugs,
skip school, have lower self-esteem, and have more health problems (Stopbullying.gov, 2016).
The National Center for Education Statistics and Bureau of Justice statistics indicate that in
2010-2011, 28% of students in grades 6-12 experienced bullying and 7% experienced
cyberbullying. The 2013 Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System, which monitors six types of
health risk behaviors, indicate that 20% of students in grades 9-12 experienced bullying and 15%
experienced cyberbullying (Stopbullying.gov, 2016).
Those at risk for bullying: Bullying can happen to anyone, but some students are at an
increased risk for being bullied including lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgendered (LGBT) youth,
those with disabilities, and those who are socially isolated. Additionally, those who are
perceived as different, weak, less popular, overweight, or having low self-esteem, have a higher
likelihood of being bullied.

199

Figure 5.23

Those who are more likely to bully: Bullies are often
thought of as having low self-esteem, and then bully
others to feel better about themselves. Although this can
occur, many bullies in fact have high levels of selfesteem. They possess considerable popularity and social
power and have well-connected peer relationships.
They do not lack self-esteem, and instead lack empathy
for others. They like to dominate or be in charge of
others.

Bullied children often do not ask for help:
Unfortunately, most children do not let adults know that
they are being bullied. Some fear retaliation from the bully, while others are too embarrassed to
ask for help. Those who are socially isolated may not know who to ask for help or believe that
no one would care or assist them if they did ask for assistance. Consequently, it is important for
parents and teacher to know the warning signs that may indicate a child is being bullied. These
include: unexplainable injuries, lost or destroyed possessions, changes in eating or sleeping
patterns, declining school grades, not wanting to go to school, loss of friends, decreased selfesteem and/or self-destructive behaviors.

Family Life
Family Tasks: One of the ways to assess the quality of family life is to consider the tasks of
families. Berger (2014) lists five family functions:
1. Providing food, clothing and shelter
2. Encouraging learning
3. Developing self-esteem
4. Nurturing friendships with peers
5. Providing harmony and stability
Notice that in addition to providing food, shelter, and clothing, families are responsible for
helping the child learn, relate to others, and have a confident sense of self. Hopefully, the family
will provide a harmonious and stable environment for living. A good home environment is one in
which the child's physical, cognitive, emotional, and social needs are adequately met. Sometimes
families emphasize physical needs but ignore cognitive or emotional needs. Other times, families
pay close attention to physical needs and academic requirements but may fail to nurture the
child's friendships with peers or guide the child toward developing healthy relationships.
Parents might want to consider how it feels to live in the household as a child. The tasks of
families listed above are functions that can be fulfilled in a variety of family types-not just intact,
two-parent households.
Parenting Styles: As discussed in the previous chapter, parenting styles affect the relationship
parents have with their children. During middle and late childhood, children spend less time with
parents and more time with peers, and consequently parents may have to modify their approach
to parenting to accommodate the child's growing independence. The authoritative style, which
200

incorporates reason and engaging in joint decision-making whenever possible may be the most
effective approach (Berk, 2007). However, Asian-American, African-American, and MexicanAmerican parents are more likely than European-Americans to use an authoritarian style of
parenting. This authoritarian style of parenting that uses strict discipline and focuses on
obedience is also tempered with acceptance and warmth on the part of the parents. Children
raised in this manner tend to be confident, successful and happy (Chao, 2001; Stewart & Bond,
2002).
Living Arrangements: Certainly, the living arrangements of children have changed
significantly over the years. In 1960, 92% of children resided with married parents, while only
5% had parents who were divorced or separated and 1% resided with parents who had never
been married. By 2008, 70% of children resided with married parents, 15% had parent who were
divorced or separated, and 14% resided with parents who had never married (Pew Research
Center, 2010). In 2017, only 65% of children lived with two married parents, while 32% (24
million children younger than 18) lived with an unmarried parent (Livingston, 2018). Some 3%
of children were not living with any parents, according to the U.S. Census Bureau data.
Most children in unmarried parent households in 2017 were living with a solo mother (21%), but
a growing share were living with cohabiting parents (7%) or a sole father (4%) (see Figure 5.24).
The increase in children living with solo or cohabiting parents was thought to be due to the
overall declines in marriage, as well as increases in divorce. Of concern is that living with only
one parent was associated with a household’s lower economic situation. Specifically, 30% of
solo mothers, 17% of solo fathers, and 16% of families with a cohabitating couple lived in
poverty. In contrast, only 8% of married couples lived below the poverty line (Livingston,
2018).

Lesbian and Gay Parenting: Research has
consistently shown that the children of lesbian and
gay parents are as successful as those of heterosexual
parents, and consequently efforts are being made to
ensure that gay and lesbian couples are provided with
the same legal rights as heterosexual couples when
adopting children (American Civil Liberties Union,
2016).

Patterson (2013) reviewed more than 25 years of
social science research on the development of children
raised by lesbian and gay parents and found no
evidence of detrimental effects. In fact, research has
demonstrated that children of lesbian and gay parents
are as well-adjusted overall as those of heterosexual
parents. Specifically, research comparing children
based on parental sexual orientation has not shown
any differences in the development of gender identity,
Source
gender role development, or sexual orientation.
Additionally, there were no differences between the
children of lesbian or gay parents and those of heterosexual parents in separation-individuation,
behavior problems, self-concept, locus of control, moral judgment, school adjustment,
intelligence, victimization, and substance use. Further, research has consistently found that
children and adolescents of gay and lesbian parents report normal social relationships with
family members, peers, and other adults. Patterson concluded that there is no evidence to
support legal discrimination or policy bias against lesbian and gay parents.
Divorce: Using families in the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
(NICHD) Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development, Weaver and Schofield (2015)
found that children from divorced families had significantly more behavior problems than those
from a matched sample of children from non-divorced families. These problems were evident
immediately after the separation and also in early and middle adolescence. An analysis of
divorce factors indicated that children exhibited more externalizing behaviors if the family had
fewer financial resources before the separation. It was hypothesized that the lower income and
lack of educational and community resources contributed to the stress involved in the divorce.
Additional factors contributing to children’s behavior problems included a post-divorce home
that was less supportive and stimulating, and a mother that was less sensitive and more
depressed.
Additional concerns include that the child will grieve the loss of the parent they no longer see as
frequently. The child may also grieve about other family members that are no longer
available. Very often, divorce means a change in the amount of money coming into the
household. Custodial mothers experience a 25% to 50% drop in their family income, and even
five years after the divorce they have reached only 94% of their pre-divorce family income
(Anderson, 2018). As a result, children experience new constraints on spending or
entertainment. School-aged children, especially, may notice that they can no longer have toys,
202

clothing or other items to which they have grown accustomed. Or it may mean that there is less
eating out or being able to afford participation in extracurricular activities. The custodial parent
may experience stress at not being able to rely on child support payments or having the same
level of income as before. This can affect decisions regarding healthcare, vacations, rents,
mortgages and other expenditures, and the stress can result in less happiness and relaxation in the
home. The parent who has to take on more work may also be less available to the children.
Children may also have to adjust to other changes accompanying a divorce. The divorce might
mean moving to a new home and changing schools or friends. It might mean leaving a
neighborhood that has meant a lot to them as well.
Relationships of adult children of divorce are identified as more problematic than those adults
from intact homes. For 25 years, Hetherington and Kelly (2002) followed children of divorce
and those whose parents stayed together. The results indicated that 25% of adults whose parents
had divorced experienced social, emotional, or psychological problems compared with only 10%
of those whose parents remained married. For example, children of divorce have more difficulty
forming and sustaining intimate relationships as young adults, are more dissatisfied with their
marriage, and consequently more likely to get divorced themselves (Arkowitz & Lilienfeld,
2013). One of the most commonly cited long-term effects of divorce is that children of divorce
may have lower levels of education or occupational status (Richter & Lemola, 2017). This may
be a consequence of lower income and resources for funding education rather than to divorce per
se. In those households where, economic hardship does not occur, there may be no impact on
long-term economic status (Drexler, 2005).
According to Arkowitz and Lilienfeld (2013), long-term harm from parental divorce is not
inevitable, however, and children can navigate the experience successfully. A variety of factors
can positively contribute to the child’s adjustment. For example, children manage better when
parents limit conflict, and provide warmth, emotional support and appropriate discipline.
Further, children cope better when they reside with a well-functioning parent and have access to
social support from peers and other adults. Those at a higher socioeconomic status may fare
better because some of the negative consequences of divorce are a result of financial hardship
rather than divorce per se (Anderson, 2014; Drexler, 2005). It is important when considering the
research findings on the consequences of divorce for children to consider all the factors that can
influence the outcome, as some of the negative consequences associated with divorce are due to
preexisting problems (Anderson, 2014). Although they may experience more problems than
children from non-divorced families, most children of divorce lead happy, well-adjusted lives
and develop strong, positive relationships with their custodial parent (Seccombe & Warner,
2004).
Children from single-parent families talk to their mothers more often than children of two-parent
families (McLanahan & Sandefur, 1994). In a study of college-age respondents, Arditti (1999)
found that increasing closeness and a movement toward more democratic parenting styles was
experienced. Others have also found that relationships between mothers and children become
closer and stronger (Guttman, 1993) and suggest that greater equality and less rigid parenting is
beneficial after divorce (Steward, Copeland, Chester, Malley, & Barenbaum, 1997).

203

Certain characteristics of the child can also facilitate post-divorce adjustment. Specifically,
children with an easygoing temperament, who problem-solve well, and seek social support
manage better after divorce. A further protective factor for children is intelligence (Weaver &
Schofield, 2015). Children with higher IQ scores appear to be buffered from the effects of
divorce. Children may be given more opportunity to discover their own abilities and gain
independence that fosters self-esteem. If divorce means a reduction in tension, the child may feel
relief. Overall, not all children of divorce suffer negative consequences (Hetherington & Kelly,
2002). Furstenberg and Cherlin (1991) believe that the primary factor influencing the way that
children adjust to divorce is the way the custodial parent adjusts to the divorce. If that parent is
adjusting well, the children will benefit. This may explain a good deal of the variation we find in
children of divorce.
Is cohabitation and remarriage more difficult than divorce for the child? The remarriage of
a parent may be a more difficult adjustment for a child than the divorce of a parent (Seccombe &
Warner, 2004). Parents and children typically have different ideas of how the stepparent should
act. Parents and stepparents are more likely to see the stepparent's role as that of parent. A more
democratic style of parenting may become more authoritarian after a parent remarries. Biological
parents are more likely to continue to be involved with their children jointly when neither parent
has remarried. They are least likely to jointly be involved if the father has remarried and the
mother has not. Cohabitation can be difficult for children to adjust to because cohabiting
relationships in the United States tend to be short-lived. About 50 percent last less than 2 years
(Brown, 2000). The child who starts a relationship with the parent's live-in partner may have to
sever this relationship later. Even in long-term cohabiting relationships, once it is over,
continued contact with the child is rare.
Blended Families: One in six children (16%)
Figure 5.26 Blended Family
live in blended families (Pew Research Center,
2015). As can be seen in Figure 5.27, Hispanic,
black and white children are equally likely to be
living in a blended family. In contrast, children
of Asian descent are more likely to be living with
two married parents, often in their first
marriage. Blended families are not new. In the
1700-1800s there were many blended families,
but they were created because someone died and
remarried. Most blended families today are a
result of divorce and remarriage, and such
origins lead to new considerations. Blended
Source
families are different from intact families and
more complex in a number of ways that can pose
unique challenges to those who seek to form successful blended family relationships (Visher &
Visher, 1985). Children may be a part of two households, each with different rules that can be
confusing.

204

Figure 5.27

Members in blended families may not be as sure that
others care and may require more demonstrations of
affection for reassurance. For example, stepparents
expect more gratitude and acknowledgment from the
stepchild than they would with a biological child.
Stepchildren experience more uncertainty/insecurity in
their relationship with the parent and fear the parents will
see them as sources of tension. Stepparents may feel
guilty for a lack of feelings they may initially have
toward their partner's children. Children who are required
to respond to the parent's new mate as though they were
the child's "real" parent often react with hostility,
rebellion, or withdrawal. This occurs especially if there
has not been time for the relationship to develop.

Chapter 6: Adolescence
Adolescence is a period that begins with puberty and ends with the transition to adulthood
(approximately ages 10–18). Physical changes associated with puberty are triggered by
hormones. Changes happen at different rates in distinct parts of the brain and increase
adolescents’ propensity for risky behavior. Cognitive changes include improvements in complex
and abstract thought. Adolescents’ relationships with parents go through a period of redefinition
in which adolescents become more autonomous. Peer relationships are important sources of
support, but companionship during adolescence can also promote problem behaviors. Identity
formation occurs as adolescents explore and commit to different roles and ideological positions.
Because so much is happening in these years, psychologists have focused a great deal of
attention on the period of adolescence.

Growth in Adolescence
Puberty is a period of rapid growth and sexual maturation. These changes begin sometime
between eight and fourteen. Girls begin puberty at around ten years of age and boys begin
approximately two years later. Pubertal changes take around three to four years to complete.
Adolescents experience an overall physical growth spurt. The growth proceeds from the
extremities toward the torso. This is referred to as distalproximal development. First the hands
grow, then the arms, and finally the torso. The overall physical growth spurt results in 10-11
inches of added height and 50 to 75 pounds of increased weight. The head begins to grow
sometime after the feet have gone through their period of growth. Growth of the head is
preceded by growth of the ears, nose, and lips. The difference in these patterns of growth result
in adolescents appearing awkward and out-of-proportion. As the torso grows, so does the internal
organs. The heart and lungs experience dramatic growth during this period.
During childhood, boys and girls are quite similar in height and weight. However, gender
differences become apparent during adolescence. From approximately age ten to fourteen, the
average girl is taller, but not heavier, than the average boy. After that, the average boy becomes
215

both taller and heavier, although individual differences are certainly noted. As adolescents
physically mature, weight differences are more noteworthy than height differences. At eighteen
years of age, those that are heaviest weigh almost twice as much as the lightest, but the tallest
teens are only about 10% taller than the shortest (Seifert, 2012).
Both height and weight can certainly be sensitive issues for some teenagers. Most modern
societies, and the teenagers in them, tend to favor relatively short women and tall men, as well as
a somewhat thin body build, especially for girls and women. Yet, neither socially preferred
height nor thinness is the destiny for many individuals. Being overweight, in particular, has
become a common, serious problem in modern society due to the prevalence of diets high in fat
and lifestyles low in activity (Tartamella, Herscher, & Woolston, 2004). The educational system
has, unfortunately, contributed to the problem as well by gradually restricting the number of
physical education courses and classes in the past two decades.
Average height and weight are also related somewhat to racial and ethnic background. In
general, children of Asian background tend to be slightly shorter than children of European and
North American background. The latter in turn tend to be shorter than children from African
societies (Eveleth & Tanner, 1990). Body shape differs slightly as well, though the differences
are not always visible until after puberty. Asian background youth tend to have arms and legs
that are a bit short relative to their torsos, and African background youth tend to have relatively
long arms and legs. The differences are only averages, as there are large individual differences as
well.

Sexual Development
Typically, the growth spurt is followed by the development of sexual maturity. Sexual changes
are divided into two categories: Primary sexual characteristics and secondary sexual
characteristics. Primary sexual characteristics are changes in the reproductive organs. For
males, this includes growth of the testes, penis, scrotum, and spermarche or first ejaculation of
semen. This occurs between 11 and 15 years of age. For females, primary characteristics include
growth of the uterus and menarche or the first menstrual period. The female gametes, which
are stored in the ovaries, are present at birth, but are immature. Each ovary contains about
400,000 gametes, but only 500 will become mature eggs (Crooks & Baur, 2007). Beginning at
puberty, one ovum ripens and is released about every 28 days during the menstrual cycle. Stress
and higher percentage of body fat can bring menstruation at younger ages.
Male Anatomy: Males have both internal and external genitalia that are responsible for
procreation and sexual intercourse. Males produce their sperm on a cycle, and unlike the female's
ovulation cycle, the male sperm production cycle is constantly producing millions of sperm
daily. The main male sex organs are the penis and the testicles, the latter of which produce
semen and sperm. The semen and sperm, as a result of sexual intercourse, can fertilize an ovum
in the female's body; the fertilized ovum (zygote) develops into a fetus which is later born as a
child.

Female Anatomy: Female
external genitalia is collectively
known as the vulva, which
includes the mons veneris, labia
majora, labia minora, clitoris,
vaginal opening, and urethral
opening. Female internal
reproductive organs consist of
the vagina, uterus, fallopian
tubes, and ovaries. The uterus
hosts the developing fetus,
produces vaginal and uterine
secretions, and passes the male's
sperm through to the fallopian
tubes while the ovaries release
the eggs. A female is born with
Source
all her eggs already produced.
The vagina is attached to the
uterus through the cervix, while the uterus is attached to the ovaries via the fallopian tubes.
Females have a monthly reproductive cycle; at certain intervals the ovaries release an egg, which
passes through the fallopian tube into the uterus. If, in this transit, it meets with sperm, the sperm
might penetrate and merge with the egg, fertilizing it. If not fertilized, the egg is flushed out of
the system through menstruation.

217

Secondary sexual characteristics are visible physical
changes not directly linked to reproduction but signal
sexual maturity. For males this includes broader shoulders
and a lower voice as the larynx grows. Hair becomes
coarser and darker, and hair growth occurs in the pubic
area, under the arms and on the face. For females, breast
development occurs around age 10, although full
development takes several years. Hips broaden, and pubic
and underarm hair develops and also becomes darker and
coarser.

Acne: An unpleasant consequence of the hormonal changes in puberty is acne, defined as
pimples on the skin due to overactive sebaceous (oil-producing) glands (Dolgin, 2011). These
glands develop at a greater speed than the skin ducts that discharges the oil. Consequently, the
ducts can become blocked with dead skin and acne will develop. According to the University of
California at Los Angeles Medical Center (2000), approximately 85% of adolescents develop
acne, and boys develop acne more than girls because of greater levels of testosterone in their
systems (Dolgin, 2011). Experiencing acne can lead the adolescent to withdraw socially,
especially if they are self-conscious about their skin or teased (Goodman, 2006).
Effects of Pubertal Age: The age of puberty is getting younger for children throughout the
world. According to Euling et al. (2008) data are sufficient to suggest a trend toward an earlier
breast development onset and menarche in girls. A century ago the average age of a girl’s first
period in the United States and Europe was 16, while today it is around 13. Because there is no
clear marker of puberty for boys, it is harder to determine if boys are maturing earlier too. In
addition to better nutrition, less positive reasons associated with early puberty for girls include
increased stress, obesity, and endocrine disrupting chemicals.
Cultural differences are noted with Asian-American girls, on average, developing last, while
African American girls enter puberty the earliest. Hispanic girls start puberty the second earliest,
while European-American girls rank third in their age of starting puberty. Although AfricanAmerican girls are typically the first to develop, they are less likely to experience negative
consequences of early puberty when compared to European-American girls (Weir, 2016).
Research has demonstrated mental health problems linked to children who begin puberty earlier
than their peers. For girls, early puberty is associated with depression, substance use, eating
disorders, disruptive behavior disorders, and early sexual behavior (Graber, 2013). Early
maturing girls demonstrate more anxiety and less confidence in their relationships with family
and friends, and they compare themselves more negatively to their peers (Weir, 2016).
Problems with early puberty seem to be due to the mismatch between the child’s appearance and
the way she acts and thinks. Adults especially may assume the child is more capable than she
actually is, and parents might grant more freedom than the child’s age would indicate. For girls,
the emphasis on physical attractiveness and sexuality is emphasized at puberty and they may lack
effective coping strategies to deal with the attention they may receive.

218

Figure 6.4

Additionally, mental health problems are more likely to occur when
the child is among the first in his or her peer group to develop.
Because the preadolescent time is one of not wanting to appear
different, early developing children stand out among their peer group
and gravitate toward those who are older. For girls, this results in
them interacting with older peers who engage in risky behaviors such
as substance use and early sexual behavior (Weir, 2016).

Boys also see changes in their emotional functioning at puberty.
According to Mendle, Harden, Brooks-Gunn, and Graber (2010),
while most boys experienced a decrease in depressive symptoms
during puberty, boys who began puberty earlier and exhibited a rapid
Source
tempo, or a fast rate of change, actually increased in depressive
symptoms. The effects of pubertal tempo were stronger than those of
pubertal timing, suggesting that rapid pubertal change in boys may be a more important risk
factor than the timing of development. In a further study to better analyze the reasons for this
change, Mendle, Harden, Brooks-Gunn and Graber (2012) found that both early maturing boys
and rapidly maturing boys displayed decrements in the quality of their peer relationships as they
moved into early adolescence, whereas boys with more typical timing and tempo development
actually experienced improvements in peer relationships. The researchers concluded that the
transition in peer relationships may be especially challenging for boys whose pubertal maturation
differs significantly from those of others their age. Consequences for boys attaining early
puberty were increased odds of cigarette, alcohol, or another drug use (Dudovitz, et al., 2015).
Gender Role Intensification: At about the same
Figure 6.5
time that puberty accentuates gender, role
differences also accentuate for at least some
teenagers. Some girls who excelled at math or
science in elementary school, may curb their
enthusiasm and displays of success at these
subjects for fear of limiting their popularity or
attractiveness as girls (Taylor, Gilligan, &
Sullivan, 1995; Sadker, 2004). Some boys who
were not especially interested in sports previously
may begin dedicating themselves to athletics to
affirm their masculinity in the eyes of others.
Some boys and girls who once worked together
Source
successfully on class projects may no longer feel
comfortable doing so, or alternatively may now seek to be working partners, but for social rather
than academic reasons. Such changes do not affect all youngsters equally, nor affect any one
youngster equally on all occasions. An individual may act like a young adult on one day, but
more like a child the next.

Adolescent Brain
The brain undergoes dramatic changes during adolescence. Although it does not get larger, it
matures by becoming more interconnected and specialized (Giedd, 2015). The myelination and
219

development of connections between neurons continues. This results in an increase in the white
matter of the brain and allows the adolescent to make significant improvements in their thinking
and processing skills. Different brain areas become myelinated at different times. For example,
the brain’s language areas undergo myelination during the first 13 years. Completed insulation
of the axons consolidates these language skills but makes it more difficult to learn a second
language. With greater myelination, however, comes diminished plasticity as a myelin coating
inhibits the growth of new connections (Dobbs, 2012).
Even as the connections between neurons are strengthened, synaptic pruning occurs more than
during childhood as the brain adapts to changes in the environment. This synaptic pruning
causes the gray matter of the brain, or the cortex, to become thinner but more efficient (Dobbs,
2012). The corpus callosum, which connects the two hemispheres, continues to thicken allowing
for stronger connections between brain areas. Additionally, the hippocampus becomes more
strongly connected to the frontal lobes, allowing for greater integration of memory and
experiences into our decision making.
The limbic system, which regulates emotion
and reward, is linked to the hormonal changes
that occur at puberty. The limbic system is
also related to novelty seeking and a shift
toward interacting with peers. In contrast, the
prefrontal cortex which is involved in the
control of impulses, organization, planning,
and making good decisions, does not fully
develop until the mid-20s. According to
Giedd (2015) the significant aspect of the
later developing prefrontal cortex and early
development of the limbic system is the
“mismatch” in timing between the two. The
Source
approximately ten years that separates the
development of these two brain areas can result in risky behavior, poor decision making, and
weak emotional control for the adolescent. When puberty begins earlier, this mismatch extends
even further.
Figure 6.6 Limbic System

Teens often take more risks than adults and according to research it is because they weigh risks
and rewards differently than adults do (Dobbs, 2012). For adolescents the brain’s sensitivity to
the neurotransmitter dopamine peaks, and dopamine is involved in reward circuits, so the
possible rewards outweighs the risks. Adolescents respond especially strongly to social rewards
during activities, and they prefer the company of others their same age. Chein et al. (2011)
found that peers sensitize brain regions associated with potential rewards. For example,
adolescent drivers make risky driving decisions when with friends to impress them, and teens are
much more likely to commit crimes together in comparison to adults (30 and older) who commit
them alone (Steinberg et al., 2017). In addition to dopamine, the adolescent brain is affected by
oxytocin which facilitates bonding and makes social connections more rewarding. With both
dopamine and oxytocin engaged, it is no wonder that adolescents seek peers and excitement in
their lives that could end up actually harming them.

Because of all the changes that occur in the adolescent brain, the chances for abnormal
development can occur, including mental illness. In fact, 50% of the mental illness occurs by the
age 14 and 75% occurs by age 24 (Giedd, 2015). Additionally, during this period of
development the adolescent brain is especially vulnerable to damage from drug exposure. For
example, repeated exposure to marijuana can affect cellular activity in the endocannabinoid
system. Consequently, adolescents are more sensitive to the effects of repeated marijuana
exposure (Weir, 2015).
However, researchers have also focused on the highly adaptive qualities of the adolescent brain
which allow the adolescent to move away from the family towards the outside world (Dobbs,
2012; Giedd, 2015). Novelty seeking and risk taking can generate positive outcomes including
meeting new people and seeking out new situations. Separating from the family and moving into
new relationships and different experiences are actually quite adaptive for society.

Adolescent Sleep
According to the National Sleep Foundation (NSF) (2016), adolescents need about 8 to 10 hours
of sleep each night to function best. The most recent Sleep in America poll in 2006 indicated
that adolescents between sixth and twelfth grade were not getting the recommended amount of
sleep. On average adolescents only received 7 ½ hours of sleep per night on school nights with
younger adolescents getting more than older ones (8.4 hours for sixth graders and only 6.9 hours
for those in twelfth grade). For the older adolescents, only about one in ten (9%) get an optimal
amount of sleep, and they are more likely to experience negative consequences the following
day. These include feeling too tired or sleepy, being cranky or irritable, falling asleep in school,
having a depressed mood, and drinking caffeinated beverages (NSF, 2016). Additionally, they
are at risk for substance abuse, car crashes, poor academic performance, obesity, and a weakened
immune system (Weintraub, 2016).
Troxel et al. (2019) found that insufficient sleep in adolescents is a predictor of risky sexual
behaviors. Reasons given for this include that those adolescents who stay out late, typically
without parental supervision, are more likely to engage in a variety of risky behaviors, including
risky sex, such as not using birth control or using substances before/during sex. An alternative
explanation for risky sexual behavior is that the lack of sleep negatively affects impulsivity and
decision-making processes.

Why do adolescents not get adequate sleep? In addition
to known environmental and social factors, including work,
homework, media, technology, and socializing, the
adolescent brain is also a factor. As adolescent go through
puberty, their circadian rhythms change and push back their
sleep time until later in the evening (Weintraub, 2016).
This biological change not only keeps adolescents awake at
night, it makes it difficult for them to wake up. When they
are awake too early, their brains do not function optimally.
Impairments are noted in attention, academic achievement,
and behavior while increases in tardiness and absenteeism
are also seen.
221

To support adolescents’ later sleeping schedule, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
recommended that school not begin any earlier than 8:30 a.m. Unfortunately, over 80% of
American schools begin their day earlier than 8:30 a.m. with an average start time of 8:03 a.m.
(Weintraub, 2016). Psychologists and other professionals have been advocating for later school
times, and they have produced research demonstrating better student outcomes for later start
times. More middle and high schools have changed their start times to better reflect the sleep
research. However, the logistics of changing start times and bus schedules are proving too
difficult for some schools leaving many adolescent vulnerable to the negative consequences of
sleep deprivation. Troxel et al. (2019) cautions that adolescents should find a middle ground
between sleeping too little during the school week and too much during the weekends. Keeping
consistent sleep schedules of too little sleep will result in sleep deprivation but oversleeping on
weekends can affect the natural biological sleep cycle making it harder to sleep on weekdays.

Adolescent Sexual Activity
By about age ten or eleven, most children experience increased sexual attraction to others that
affects social life, both in school and out (McClintock & Herdt, 1996). By the end of high
school, more than half of boys and girls report having experienced sexual intercourse at least
once, though it is hard to be certain of the proportion because of the sensitivity and privacy of the
information. (Center for Disease Control, 2004; Rosenbaum, 2006).
Adolescent Pregnancy: As
can be seen in Figure 6.8, in
2018 females aged 15–19
years experienced a birth rate
(live births) of 17.4 per 1,000
women. The birth rate for
teenagers has declined by
58% since 2007 and 72%
since 1991, the most recent
peak (Hamilton, Joyce,
Martin, & Osterman, 2019).
It appears that adolescents
seem to be less sexually
active than in previous years,
and those who are sexually
active seem to be using birth
control (CDC, 2016).

Figure 6.8

Source

Risk Factors for Adolescent Pregnancy: Miller, Benson, and Galbraith (2001) found that
parent/child closeness, parental supervision, and parents' values against teen intercourse (or
unprotected intercourse) decreased the risk of adolescent pregnancy. In contrast, residing in
disorganized/dangerous neighborhoods, living in a lower SES family, living with a single parent,

222

having older sexually active siblings or pregnant/parenting teenage sisters, early puberty, and
being a victim of sexual abuse place adolescents at an increased risk of adolescent pregnancy.
Consequences of Adolescent Pregnancy: After the child is born life can be difficult for a
teenage mother. Only 40% of teenagers who have children before age 18 graduate from high
school. Without a high school degree her job prospects are limited, and economic independence
is difficult. Teen mothers are more likely to live in poverty, and more than 75% of all unmarried
teen mother receive public assistance within 5 years of the birth of their first child.
Approximately, 64% of children born to an unmarried teenage high-school dropout live in
poverty. Further, a child born to a teenage mother is 50% more likely to repeat a grade in school
and is more likely to perform poorly on standardized tests and drop out before finishing high
school (March of Dimes, 2012).
Research analyzing the age that men father their first child and how far they complete their
education have been summarized by the Pew Research Center (2015) and reflect the research for
females. Among dads ages 22 to 44, 70% of those with less than a high school diploma say they
fathered their first child before the age of 25. In comparison, less than half (45%) of fathers with
some college experience became dads by that age. Additionally, becoming a young father occurs
much less for those with a bachelor’s degree or higher as just 14% had their first child prior to
age 25. Like men, women with more education are likely to be older when they become
mothers.

Eating Disorders
Although eating disorders can occur in children and adults,
they frequently appear during the teen years or young
adulthood (National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH),
2016). Eating disorders affect both genders, although rates
among women are 2½ times greater than among
men. Similar to women who have eating disorders, men
also have a distorted sense of body image, including
muscle dysmorphia, which is an extreme desire to
increase one’s muscularity (Bosson, Vandello, & Buckner,
2019). The prevalence of eating disorders in the United
States is similar among Non-Hispanic Whites, Hispanics,
African-Americans, and Asians, with the exception that
anorexia nervosa is more common among Non-Hispanic
Whites (Hudson, Hiripi, Pope, & Kessler, 2007; Wade,
Keski-Rahkonen, & Hudson, 2011).

Figure 6.9

Risk Factors for Eating Disorders: Because of the high mortality rate, researchers are looking
into the etiology of the disorder and associated risk factors. Researchers are finding that eating
disorders are caused by a complex interaction of genetic, biological, behavioral, psychological,
and social factors (NIMH, 2016). Eating disorders appear to run in families, and researchers are
working to identify DNA variations that are linked to the increased risk of developing eating
disorders. Researchers from King’s College London (2019) found that the genetic basis of
223

anorexia overlaps with both metabolic and body measurement traits. The genetic factors also
influence physical activity, which may explain the high activity level of those with anorexia.
Further, the genetic basis of anorexia overlaps with other psychiatric disorders. Researchers have
also found differences in patterns of brain activity in women with eating disorders in comparison
with healthy women.
The main criteria for the most common eating disorders: Anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa,
and binge-eating disorder are described in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders-Fifth Edition (DSM-5) (American Psychiatric Association, 2013) and listed in Table
6.1.
Table 6.1 DSM-5 Eating Disorders
Anorexia Nervosa
• Restriction of energy intake leading to a significantly low
body weight
• Intense fear of gaining weight
• Disturbance in one’s self-evaluation regarding body
weight
Bulimia Nervosa
• Recurrent episodes of binge eating
• Recurrent inappropriate compensatory behaviors to
prevent weight gain, including purging, laxatives, fasting
or excessive exercise
• Self-evaluation is unduly affected by body shape and
weight
Binge-Eating
• Recurrent episodes of binge eating
Disorder
• Marked distress regarding binge eating
• The binge eating is not associated with the recurrent use
of inappropriate compensatory behavior

Health Consequences of Eating Disorders: For those suffering from anorexia, health
consequences include an abnormally slow heart rate and low blood pressure, which increases the
risk for heart failure. Additionally, there is a reduction in bone density (osteoporosis), muscle
loss and weakness, severe dehydration, fainting, fatigue, and overall weakness. Anorexia
nervosa has the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric disorder (Arcelus, Mitchell, Wales, &
Nielsen, 2011). Individuals with this disorder may die from complications associated with
starvation, while others die of suicide. In women, suicide is much more common in those with
anorexia than with most other mental disorders.
The binge and purging cycle of bulimia can affect the digestives system and lead to electrolyte
and chemical imbalances that can affect the heart and other major organs. Frequent vomiting can
cause inflammation and possible rupture of the esophagus, as well as tooth decay and staining
from stomach acids. Lastly, binge eating disorder results in similar health risks to obesity,
including high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, heart disease, Type II diabetes, and gall
bladder disease (National Eating Disorders Association, 2016).

224

Eating Disorders Treatment: To treat
Figure 6.10
eating disorders, adequate nutrition and
stopping inappropriate behaviors, such as
purging, are the foundations of treatment.
Treatment plans are tailored to individual
needs and include medical care, nutritional
counseling, medications (such as
antidepressants), and individual, group,
and/or family psychotherapy (NIMH, 2016).
For example, the Maudsley Approach has
parents of adolescents with anorexia
nervosa be actively involved in their child’s
treatment, such as assuming responsibility
for feeding the child. To eliminate bingeSource
eating and purging behaviors, cognitive
behavioral therapy (CBT) assists sufferers by identifying distorted thinking patterns and
changing inaccurate beliefs.

operational thought

Piaget’s Formal Operational Stage
During the formal operational stage, adolescents are able to understand abstract principles
which have no physical reference. They can now contemplate such abstract constructs as beauty,
love, freedom, and morality. The adolescent is no longer limited by what can be directly seen or
heard. Additionally, while younger children solve problems through trial and error, adolescents
demonstrate hypothetical-deductive reasoning, which is developing hypotheses based on what
might logically occur. They are able to think about all the possibilities in a situation beforehand,
and then test them systematically (Crain, 2005). Now they are able to engage in true scientific
thinking.
Formal operational thinking also involves accepting hypothetical situations. Adolescents
understand the concept of transitivity, which means that a relationship between two elements is
carried over to other elements logically related to the first two, such as if A<B and B<C, then
225

A<C (Thomas, 1979). For example, when asked: If Maria is shorter than Alicia and Alicia is
shorter than Caitlyn, who is the shortest? Adolescents are able to answer the question correctly
as they understand the transitivity involved.
Does everyone reach formal operations? According to Piaget, most people attain some degree
of formal operational thinking, but use formal operations primarily in the areas of their strongest
interest (Crain, 2005). In fact, most adults do not regularly demonstrate formal operational
thought, and in small villages and tribal communities, it is barely used at all. A possible
explanation is that an individual’s thinking has not been sufficiently challenged to demonstrate
formal operational thought in all areas.
Figure 6.11
Adolescent Egocentrism: Once adolescents can understand abstract
thoughts, they enter a world of hypothetical possibilities and demonstrate
egocentrism or a heightened self-focus. The egocentricity comes from
attributing unlimited power to their own thoughts (Crain, 2005). Piaget
believed it was not until adolescents took on adult roles that they would be
able to learn the limits to their own thoughts.
David Elkind (1967) expanded on the concept of Piaget’s adolescent
Source
egocentricity. Elkind theorized that the physiological changes that occur
during adolescence result in adolescents being primarily concerned with
themselves. Additionally, since adolescents fail to differentiate between what others are thinking
and their own thoughts, they believe that others are just as fascinated with their behavior and
appearance. This belief results in the adolescent anticipating the reactions of others, and
consequently constructing an imaginary audience. “The imaginary audience is the adolescent’s
belief that those around them are as concerned and focused on their appearance as they
themselves are” (Schwartz, Maynard, & Uzelac, 2008, p. 441). Elkind thought that the
imaginary audience contributed to the self-consciousness that occurs during early adolescence.
The desire for privacy and reluctance to share personal information may be a further reaction to
feeling under constant observation by others. Alternatively, recent research has indicated that the
imaginary audience is not imaginary. Specifically, adolescents and adults feel that they are often
under scrutiny by others, especially if they are active on social media (Yau & Reich, 2018).
Another important consequence of adolescent egocentrism is the personal fable or belief that
one is unique, special, and invulnerable to harm. Elkind (1967) explains that because
adolescents feel so important to others (imaginary audience) they regard themselves and their
feelings as being special and unique. Adolescents believe that only they have experienced strong
and diverse emotions, and therefore others could never understand how they feel. This
uniqueness in one’s emotional experiences reinforces the adolescent’s belief of invulnerability,
especially to death. Adolescents will engage in risky behaviors, such as drinking and driving or
unprotected sex, and feel they will not suffer any negative consequences. Elkind believed that
adolescent egocentricity emerged in early adolescence and declined in middle adolescence,
however, recent research has also identified egocentricity in late adolescence (Schwartz, et al.,
2008).

226

Consequences of Formal Operational Thought: As adolescents are now able to think
abstractly and hypothetically, they exhibit many new ways of reflecting on information (Dolgin,
2011). For example, they demonstrate greater introspection or thinking about one’s thoughts
and feelings. They begin to imagine how the world could be which leads them to become
idealistic or insisting upon high standards of behavior. Because of their idealism, they may
become critical of others, especially adults in their life. Additionally, adolescents can
demonstrate hypocrisy, or pretend to be what they are not. Since they are able to recognize
what others expect of them, they will conform to those expectations for their emotions and
behavior seemingly hypocritical to themselves. Lastly, adolescents can exhibit pseudostupidity.
This is when they approach problems at a level that is too complex, and they fail because the
tasks are too simple. Their new ability to consider alternatives is not completely under control
and they appear “stupid” when they are in fact bright, just not experienced.

Information Processing
Cognitive Control: As noted in earlier chapters, executive functions, such as attention, increases
in working memory, and cognitive flexibility have been steadily improving since early
childhood. Studies have found that executive function is very competent in adolescence.
However, self-regulation, or the ability to control impulses, may still fail. A failure in selfregulation is especially true when there is high stress or high demand on mental functions
(Luciano & Collins, 2012). While high stress or demand may tax even an adult’s self-regulatory
abilities, neurological changes in the adolescent brain may make teens particularly prone to more
risky decision making under these conditions.
Inductive and Deductive
Figure 6.12
Reasoning: Inductive
reasoning emerges in
childhood and occurs when
specific observations, or
specific comments from
those in authority, may be
used to draw general
conclusions. This is
sometimes referred to as
“bottom-up-processing”.
However, in inductive
reasoning the veracity of the
information that created the
general conclusion does not
guarantee the accuracy of
that conclusion. For instance, a child who has only observed thunder on summer days may
conclude that it only thunders in the summer. In contrast, deductive reasoning emerges in
adolescence and refers to reasoning that starts with some overarching principle and based on
this proposes specific conclusions. This is sometimes referred to as “top-down-processing”.
Deductive reasoning guarantees a truthful conclusion if the premises on which it is based are
accurate.
227

Intuitive versus Analytic Thinking: Cognitive psychologists often refer to intuitive and
analytic thought as the Dual-Process Model; the notion that humans have two distinct networks
for processing information (Albert & Steinberg, 2011). Intuitive thought is automatic,
unconscious, and fast (Kahneman, 2011), and it is more experiential and emotional. In contrast,
analytic thought is deliberate, conscious, and rational. While these systems interact, they are
distinct (Kuhn, 2013). Intuitive thought is easier and more commonly used in everyday life. It is
also more commonly used by children and teens than by adults (Klaczynski, 2001). The
quickness of adolescent thought, along with the maturation of the limbic system, may make teens
more prone to emotional intuitive thinking than adults.

Education
In early adolescence, the transition from elementary school to middle school can be difficult for
many students, both academically and socially. Crosnoe and Benner (2015) found that some
students became disengaged and alienated during this transition which resulted in negative longterm consequences in academic performance and mental health. This may be because middle
school teachers are seen as less supportive than elementary school teachers (Brass, McKellar,
North, & Ryan, 2019). Similarly, the transition to high school can be difficult. For example,
high schools are larger, more bureaucratic, less personal, and there are less opportunities for
teachers to get to know their students (Eccles & Roeser, 2016).
Peers: Certainly, the beliefs and expectations about academic success supported by an
adolescent’s family play a significant role in the student’s achievement and school engagement.
However, research has also focused on the importance of peers in an adolescent’s school
experience. Specifically, having friends who are high-achieving, academically motivated and
engaged promotes motivation and engagement in the adolescent, while those whose friends are
unmotivated, disengaged, and low achieving promotes the same feelings (Shin & Ryan, 2014;
Vaillancourt, Paiva, Véronneau, & Dishion, 2019).
Gender: Crosnoe and Benner (2015) found that female students earn better grades, try harder,
and are more intrinsically motivated than male students. Further, Duchesne, Larose, and Feng
(2019) described how female students were more oriented toward skill mastery, used a variety of
learning strategies, and persevered more than males. However, more females exhibit worries and
anxiety about school, including feeling that they must please teachers and parents. These worries
can heighten their effort but lead to fears of disappointing others. In contrast, males are more
confident and do not value adult feedback regarding their academic performance (Brass et al.,
2019). There is a subset of female students who identify with sexualized gender stereotypes
(SGS), however, and they tend to underperform academically. These female students endorse
the beliefs that “girls” should be sexy and not smart. Nelson and Brown (2019) found that female
students who support SGS, reported less desire to master skills and concepts, were more
skeptical of the usefulness of an education, and downplayed their intelligence.
Life of a high school student: On average, high school teens spend approximately 7 hours each
weekday and 1.1 hours each day on the weekend on educational activities. This includes
attending classes, participating in extracurricular activities (excluding sports), and doing
homework (Office of Adolescent Health, 2018). High school males and females spend about the

228

same amount of time in class, doing homework, eating and drinking, and working. However,
they do spend their time outside of these activities in different ways.
• High school males. On average, high school males spend about one more hour per day on
media and communications activities than females on both weekdays (2.9 vs. 1.8 hours)
and weekend days (4.8 vs. 3.8 hours). They also spend more time playing sports on both
weekdays (0.9 vs. 0.5 hours) and weekend days (1.2 vs. 0.5 hours). On weekdays, high
school males get an hour more of sleep than females (9.2 vs. 8.2 hours, on average).
• High school females. On an average weekday, high school females spend more time than
boys on both leisure activities (1.7 vs. 1.1 hours) and religious activities (0.1 vs. 0.0
hours). High school females also spend more time on grooming on both weekdays and
weekend days (1.1 vs. 0.7 hours, on average for both weekdays and weekend days).
High School Dropouts: The status dropout rate refers to the percentage of 16 to 24 year-olds
who are not enrolled in school and do not have high school credentials (either a diploma or an
equivalency credential such as a General Educational Development [GED] certificate). The
dropout rate is based on sample surveys of the civilian, noninstitutionalized population, which
excludes persons in prisons, persons in the military, and other persons not living in households.
The dropout rate among high school students has declined from a rate of 12% in 1990, to 6.1% in
2016 (U.S. Department of Education, 2018). The rate is lower for Whites than for Blacks, and
the rates for both Whites and Blacks are lower than the rate for Hispanics. However, the gap
between Whites, Blacks, and Hispanics have narrowed (see Figure 6.13).
Figure 6.13 Percentage of high school dropouts among persons 16 through 24 years old
(status dropout rate), by race/ethnicity: October 1976 through 2016

229

The dropout rate for males in 1990 was 12%, where it stayed until 2000. Thereafter the rate has
dropped to 7.1% in 2016. The dropout rate for females in 1990 was 12%, and it has dropped to
5.1% in 2016 (U.S. Department of Education, 2018).
Reasons for Dropping Out of School: Garcia et al. (2018) reviewed the research on why
students dropped out of school and identified several major obstacles to school completion.
These included: Adolescents who resided in foster care or were part of the juvenile justice
system. In fact, being confined in a juvenile detention facility practically guaranteed that a
student would not complete school. Having a physical or mental health condition, or the need for
special educational services, adversely affected school completion. Being maltreated due to
abuse or neglect and/or being homeless also contributed to dropping out of school. Additonally,
adolescent-specific factors, including race, ethnicity and age, as well as family-specific
characteristics, such as poverty, single parenting, large family size, and stressful transitions, all
contributed to an increased likelihood of dropping-out of school. Lastly, community factors, such
as unsafe neighborhoods, gang activity, and a lack of social services increased the number of
school dropouts.

School Based Preparatory Experiences
According to the U. S. Department of Labor (2019), to perform at optimal levels in all education
settings, all youth need to participate in educational programs grounded in standards, clear
performance expectations and graduation exit options based upon meaningful, accurate, and
relevant indicators of student learning and skills. These should include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Academic programs that are based on clear state standards
Career and technical education programs that are based on professional and industry
standards
Curricular and program options based on universal design of school, work and communitybased learning experiences
Learning environments that are small and safe, including extra supports such as tutoring, as
necessary
Supports from and by highly qualified staff;
Access to an assessment system that includes multiple measures, and
Graduation standards that include options.

Teenagers and Working
Many adolescents work either summer jobs, or during the school year. Holding a job may offer
teenagers extra funds, the opportunity to learn new skills, ideas about future careers, and perhaps
the true value of money. However, there are numerous concerns about teenagers working,
especially during the school year. A long-standing concern is that that it “engenders precocious
maturity of more adult-like roles and problem behaviors” (Staff, VanEseltine, Woolnough,
Silver, & Burrington, 2011, p. 150).

230

Figure 6.14

Source

Several studies have found that working more than 20
hours per week can lead to declines in grades, a general
disengagement from school (Staff, Schulenberg, &
Bachman, 2010; Lee & Staff, 2007; Marsh & Kleitman,
2005), an increase in substance abuse (Longest &
Shanahan, 2007), engaging in earlier sexual behavior,
and pregnancy (Staff et al., 2011). However, like many
employee groups, teens have seen a drop in the number
of jobs. The summer jobs of previous generations have
been on a steady decline, according to the United States
Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics (2016).
See Figure 6.15 for recent trends.

Figure: 6.15

Teenage Drivers
Driving gives teens a sense of freedom and independence from their parents. It can also free up
time for parents as they are not shuttling teens to and from school, activities, or work. The
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) reports that in 2014 young drivers
(15 to 20 year-olds) accounted for 5.5% (11.7 million) of the total number of drivers (214
million) in the US (National Center for Statistics and Analysis (NCSA), 2016).

231

However, almost 9% of all drivers involved in fatal crashes
Figure 6.16
that year were young drivers (NCSA, 2016), and according to
the National Center for Health Statistics (2014), motor
vehicle accidents are the leading cause of death for 15 to 20
year-olds. “In all motorized jurisdictions around the world,
young, inexperienced drivers have much higher crash rates
than older, more experienced drivers” (NCSA, 2016, p. 1). A
teen’s risk of an accident is especially high during the first
months of receiving a license (CDC, 2018a). The rate of fatal
crashes is twice as high for young males as for young females Source
(CDC, 2018a), although for both genders the rate was highest
for the 15-20 years-old age group. For young males, the rate for fatal crashes was approximately
46 per 100,000 drivers, compared to 20 per 100,000 drivers for young females. The NHTSA
(NCSA, 2016) reported that of the young drivers who were killed and who had alcohol in their
system, 81% had a blood alcohol count past what was considered the legal limit. Fatal crashes
involving alcohol use were higher among young men than young women. The NHTSA also
found that teens were less likely to use seat belt restraints if they were driving under the
influence of alcohol, and that restraint use decreased as the level of alcohol intoxication
increased. Overall, teens have the lowest rate of seat belt use. In a 2017 CDC survey, only 59%
of teens reported that they always wore a seat belt when riding as a passenger (CDC, 2018b).
Crash data shows that almost half of teenage passengers who die in a car crash were not wearing
a seat belt (Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, 2017).
In a AAA study of non-fatal, but moderate to severe motor vehicle accidents in 2014, more than
half involved young male drivers 16 to 19 years of age (Carney, McGehee, Harland, Weiss, &
Raby, 2015). In 36% of rear-end collisions, teen drivers were following cars too closely to be
able to stop in time, and in single-vehicle accidents, driving too fast for weather and road
conditions was a factor in 79% of crashes involving teens. Distraction was also a factor in nearly
60% of the accidents involving teen drivers. Fellow passengers, often also teenagers (84% of the
time), and cell phones were the top two sources of distraction, respectively. This data suggested
that having another teenager in the car increased the risk of an accident by 44% (Carney et al.,
2015). According to the NHTSA, 10% of drivers aged 15 to 19 years involved in fatal crashes
were reported to be distracted at the time of the crash; the highest figure for any age group
(NCSA, 2016). Distraction coupled with inexperience has been found to greatly increase the risk
of an accident (Klauer et al., 2014). Finally, despite all the public service announcements
warning of the dangers of texting while driving, four out of ten teens report having engaged in
this within the past 12 months (CDC, 2018b).
The NHTSA did find that the number of accidents has been on a decline since 2005. They
attribute this to greater driver training, more social awareness to the challenges of driving for
teenagers, and to changes in laws restricting the drinking age. The NHTSA estimates that the
raising of the legal drinking age to 21 in all 50 states and the District of Columbia has saved
30,323 lives since 1975. The CDC also credits graduated driver licenses (GDL) for reducing the
number of accidents. While GDL programs vary widely, a comprehensive program has a longer
practice period, requires greater parental participation, and limits newly licensed drivers from
driving under certain high-risk conditions (CDC, 2018a).

Self-concept and Self-esteem in Adolescence
In adolescence, teens continue to develop their self-concept. Their ability to think of the
possibilities and to reason more abstractly may explain the further differentiation of the self
during adolescence. However, the teen’s understanding of self is often full of contradictions.
Young teens may see themselves as outgoing but also withdrawn, happy yet often moody, and
both smart and completely clueless (Harter, 2012). These contradictions, along with the teen’s
growing recognition that their personality and behavior seem to change depending on who they
are with or where they are, can lead the young teen to feel like a fraud. With their parents they
may seem angrier and sullen, with their friends they are more outgoing and goofier, and at work
they are quiet and cautious. “Which one is really me?” may be the refrain of the young teenager.
Harter (2012) found that adolescents emphasize traits such as being friendly and considerate
more than do children, highlighting their increasing concern about how others may see them.
Harter also found that older teens add values and moral standards to their self-descriptions.
As self-concept differentiates, so too does self-esteem. In addition to the academic, social,
appearance, and physical/athletic dimensions of self-esteem in middle and late childhood, teens
also add perceptions of their competency in romantic relationships, on the job, and in close
friendships (Harter, 2006). Self-esteem often drops when children transition from one school
setting to another, such as shifting from elementary to middle school, or junior high to high
school (Ryan, Shim, & Makara, 2013). These drops are usually temporary, unless there are
additional stressors such as parental conflict, or other family disruptions (De Wit, Karioja, Rye,
& Shain, 2011). Self-esteem rises from mid to late adolescence for most teenagers, especially if
they feel competent in their peer relationships, their appearance, and athletic abilities (Birkeland,
Melkivik, Holsen, & Wold, 2012).

Erikson: Identity vs. Role Confusion
Erikson believed that the primary psychosocial task of adolescence was establishing an identity.
Teens struggle with the question “Who am I?” This includes questions regarding their
appearance, vocational choices and career aspirations, education, relationships, sexuality,
political and social views, personality, and interests. Erikson saw this as a period of confusion
and experimentation regarding identity and one’s life path. During adolescence we experience
233

psychological moratorium, where teens put on hold commitment to an identity while exploring
the options. The culmination of this exploration is a more coherent view of oneself. Those who
are unsuccessful at resolving this stage may either withdraw further into social isolation or
become lost in the crowd. However, more recent research, suggests that few leave this age
period with identity achievement, and that most identity formation occurs during young
adulthood (Côtè, 2006).
Expanding on Erikson’s theory, James Marcia (2010) identified four identity statuses that
represent the four possible combinations of the dimension of commitment and exploration (see
Table 6.2).

Identity Achievement

The least mature status, and one common in many children, is identity diffusion. Identity
diffusion is a status that characterizes those who have neither explored the options, nor made a
commitment to an identity. Those who persist in this identity may drift aimlessly with little
connection to those around them or have little sense of purpose in life.
Figure 6.17

Those in identity foreclosure have made a commitment to
an identity without having explored the options. Some
parents may make these decisions for their children and do
not grant the teen the opportunity to make choices. In other
instances, teens may strongly identify with parents and
others in their life and wish to follow in their footsteps.
Identity moratorium is a status that describes those who
are activity exploring in an attempt to establish an identity
but have yet to have made any commitment. This can be an
anxious and emotionally tense time period as the adolescent
experiments with different roles and explores various
beliefs. Nothing is certain and there are many questions, but
few answers.
Identity achievement refers to those who after exploration
have made a commitment. This is a long process and is not
often achieved by the end of adolescence.

During high school and the college years, teens and young
adults move from identity diffusion and foreclosure toward
moratorium and achievement. The biggest gains in the
234

development of identity are in college, as college students are exposed to a greater variety of
career choices, lifestyles, and beliefs. This is likely to spur on questions regarding identity. A
great deal of the identity work we do in adolescence and young adulthood is about values and
goals, as we strive to articulate a personal vision or dream for what we hope to accomplish in the
future (McAdams, 2013).
Developmental psychologists have researched several different areas of identity development
and some of the main areas include:
Religious identity: The religious views of teens are often similar to that of their families (KimSpoon, Longo, & McCullough, 2012). Most teens may question specific customs, practices, or
ideas in the faith of their parents, but few completely reject the religion of their families.
Political identity: The political ideology of teens is also influenced by their parents’ political
beliefs. A new trend in the 21st century is a decrease in party affiliation among adults. Many
adults do not align themselves with either the democratic or republican party but view
themselves as more of an “independent”. Their teenage children are often following suit or
become more apolitical (Côtè, 2006).
Vocational identity: While adolescents in earlier generations envisioned themselves as working
in a particular job, and often worked as an apprentice or part-time in such occupations as
teenagers, this is rarely the case today. Vocational identity takes longer to develop, as most of
today’s occupations require specific skills and knowledge that will require additional education
or are acquired on the job itself. In addition, many of the jobs held by teens are not in
occupations that most teens will seek as adults.
Gender identity: Acquiring a gender identity is becoming an increasingly prolonged task as
attitudes and norms regarding gender keep changing. The roles appropriate for males and
females are evolving, and the lack of a gender binary allow adolescents more freedom to explore
various aspects of gender. Some teens may foreclose on a gender identity as a way of dealing
with this uncertainty, and they may adopt more stereotypic male or female roles (Sinclair &
Carlsson, 2013).
Sexual identity: According to Carroll (2016), by age 14 most adolescents become interested in
intimate relationships, and they may begin sexual experimentation. Many adolescent feel
pressure to express interest in opposite-sex relationships, even if they are not ready to do so. This
pressure can be especially stressful for those adolescents who are gay, lesbian, bisexual or
questioning their sexual identity. Many non-heterosexual adolescents struggle with negative peer
and family reactions during their exploration. A lack of parental acceptance, especially, can
adversely affect the gay, lesbian or bisexual adolescent’s emerging sexual identity and can result
in feelings of depression. In contrast, adolescents whose familes support their sexual identity
have better health outcomes.
Ethnic identity refers to how people come to terms with who they are based on their ethnic or
racial ancestry. “The task of ethnic identity formation involves sorting out and resolving
positive and negative feelings and attitudes about one’s own ethnic group and about other groups
and identifying one’s place in relation to both” (Phinney, 2006, p. 119). When groups differ in
status in a culture, those from the non-dominant group have to be cognizant of the customs and
235

values of those from the dominant culture. The
reverse is rarely the case. This makes ethnic
identity far less salient for members of the
dominant culture. In the United States, those of
European ancestry engage in less exploration of
ethnic identity, than do those of non-European
ancestry (Phinney, 1989). However, according
to the U.S. Census (2012) more than 40% of
Americans under the age of 18 are from ethnic
minorities. For many ethnic minority teens,
discovering one’s ethnic identity is an important
part of identity formation.

Phinney’s model of ethnic identity formation is based on Erikson’s and Marcia’s model of
identity formation (Phinney, 1990; Syed & Juang, 2014). Through the process of exploration
and commitment, individual’s come to understand and create an ethic identity. Phinney suggests
three stages or statuses with regard to ethnic identity:
1. Unexamined Ethnic Identity: Adolescents and adults who have not been exposed to
ethnic identity issues may be in the first stage, unexamined ethnic identity. This is often
characterized with a preference for the dominant culture, or where the individual has
given little thought to the question of their ethnic heritage. This is similar to diffusion in
Marcia’s model of identity. Included in this group are also those who have adopted the
ethnicity of their parents and other family members with little thought about the issues
themselves, similar to Marcia’s foreclosure status (Phinney, 1990).
2. Ethnic Identity Search: Adolescents and adults who are exploring the customs, culture,
and history of their ethnic group are in the ethnic identity search stage, similar to
Marcia’s moratorium status (Phinney, 1990). Often some event “awakens” a teen or
adult to their ethnic group; either a personal experience with prejudice, a highly profiled
case in the media, or even a more positive event that recognizes the contribution of
someone from the individual’s ethnic group. Teens and adults in this stage will immerse
themselves in their ethnic culture. For some, “it may lead to a rejection of the values of
the dominant culture” (Phinney, 1990, p. 503).
3. Achieved Ethnic Identity: Those who have actively explored their culture are likely to
have a deeper appreciation and understanding of their ethnic heritage, leading to progress
toward an achieved ethnic identity (Phinney, 1990). An achieved ethnic identity does not
necessarily imply that the individual is highly involved in the customs and values of their
ethnic culture. One can be confident in their ethnic identity without wanting to maintain
the language or other customs.
The development of ethnic identity takes time, with about 25% of tenth graders from ethnic
minority backgrounds having explored and resolved the issues (Phinney, 1989). The more
ethnically homogeneous the high school, the less identity exploration and achievement (UmanaTaylor, 2003). Moreover, even in more ethnically diverse high schools, teens tend to spend more
time with their own group, reducing exposure to other ethnicities. This may explain why, for
236

many, college becomes the time of ethnic identity exploration. “[The] transition to college may
serve as a consciousness-raising experience that triggers exploration” (Syed & Azmitia, 2009, p.
618).
It is also important to note that those who do achieve ethnic identity may periodically reexamine
the issues of ethnicity. This cycling between exploration and achievement is common not only
for ethnic identity formation, but in other aspects of identity development (Grotevant, 1987) and
is referred to as MAMA cycling or moving back and forth between moratorium and
achievement.
Bicultural/Multiracial Identity: Ethnic minorities must wrestle with the question of how, and
to what extent, they will identify with the culture of the surrounding society and with the culture
of their family. Phinney (2006) suggests that people may handle it in different ways. Some may
keep the identities separate, others may combine them in some way, while others may reject
some of them. Bicultural identity means the individual sees himself or herself as part of both
the ethnic minority group and the larger society. Those who are multiracial, that is whose
parents come from two or more ethnic or racial groups, have a more challenging task. In some
cases, their appearance may be ambiguous. This can lead to others constantly asking them to
categorize themselves. Phinney (2006) notes that the process of identity formation may start
earlier and take longer to accomplish in those who are not mono-racial.
Negative Identity: A negative identity is the adoption of norms and values that are the
opposite of one’s family and culture, and it is assumed to be one of the more problematic
outcomes of identity development in young people (Hihara, Umemura, & Sigimura, 2019).
Those with a negative identity hold dichotomous beliefs, and consequently divide the world into
two categories (e.g., friend or foe, good or bad). Hihara et al. suggest that this may be because
teens with a negative identity cannot integrate information and beliefs that exist in both their
inner and outer world. In addition, those with a negative identity are generally hostile and
cynical toward society, often because they do not trust the world around them. These beliefs
may lead teens to engage in delinquent and criminal behavior and prevent them from engaging in
more positive acts that could be beneficial to society.

Parents and Teens: Autonomy and Attachment
While most adolescents get along with their parents, they do spend less time with them
(Smetana, 2011). This decrease in the time spent with families may be a reflection of a
teenager’s greater desire for independence or autonomy. It can be difficult for many parents to
deal with this desire for autonomy. However, it is likely adaptive for teenagers to increasingly
distance themselves and establish relationships outside of their families in preparation for
adulthood. This means that both parents and teenagers need to strike a balance between
autonomy, while still maintaining close and supportive familial relationships.
Children in middle and late childhood are increasingly granted greater freedom regarding
moment-to-moment decision making. This continues in adolescence, as teens are demanding
greater control in decisions that affect their daily lives. This can increase conflict between
parents and their teenagers. For many adolescents this conflict centers on chores, homework,
curfew, dating, and personal appearance. These are all things many teens believe they should
237

manage that parents previously had considerable control over. Teens report more conflict with
their mothers, as many mothers believe they should still have some control over many of these
areas, yet often report their mothers to be more encouraging and supportive (Costigan, Cauce, &
Etchison, 2007). As teens grow older, more compromise is reached between parents and
teenagers (Smetana, 2011). Parents are more controlling of daughters, especially early maturing
girls, than they are sons (Caspi, Lynam, Moffitt, & Silva, 1993). In addition, culture and
ethnicity also play a role in how restrictive parents are with the daily lives of their children
(Chen, Vansteenkiste, Beyers, Soensens, & Van Petegem, 2013).
Having supportive, less conflict ridden relationships with parents also benefits teenagers.
Research on attachment in adolescence find that teens who are still securely attached to their
parents have less emotional problems (Rawatlal, Kliewer & Pillay, 2015), are less likely to
engage in drug abuse and other criminal behaviors (Meeus, Branje & Overbeek, 2004), and have
more positive peer relationships (Shomaker & Furman, 2009).

Peers
As children become adolescents, they usually begin spending more time with their peers and less
time with their families, and these peer interactions are increasingly unsupervised by adults.
Children’s notions of friendship often focus on shared activities, whereas adolescents’ notions of
friendship increasingly focus on intimate exchanges of thoughts and feelings. During
adolescence, peer groups evolve from primarily single-sex to mixed-sex. Adolescents within a
peer group tend to be similar to one another in behavior and attitudes, which has been explained
as a function of homophily, that is, adolescents who are similar to one another choose to spend
time together in a “birds of a feather flock together” way. Adolescents who spend time together
also shape each other’s behavior and attitudes.

Peers can serve both positive and negative functions during adolescence. Negative peer pressure
can lead adolescents to make riskier decisions or engage in more problematic behavior than they
would alone or in the presence of their family. For example, adolescents are much more likely to
drink alcohol, use drugs, and commit crimes when they are with their friends than when they are
alone or with their family. One of the most widely studied aspects of adolescent peer influence is
known as deviant peer contagion (Dishion & Tipsord, 2011), which is the process by which
peers reinforce problem behavior by laughing or showing other signs of approval that then
increase the likelihood of future problem behavior.
However, peers also serve as an important source of social support and companionship during
adolescence, and adolescents with positive peer relationships are happier and better adjusted than
those who are socially isolated or have conflictual peer relationships.
Crowds are an emerging level of peer relationships in adolescence. In contrast to friendships,
which are reciprocal dyadic relationships, and cliques, which refer to groups of individuals who
interact frequently, crowds are characterized more by shared reputations or images than actual
interactions (Brown & Larson, 2009). These crowds reflect different prototypic identities, such
as jocks or brains, and are often linked with adolescents’ social status and peers’ perceptions of
their values or behaviors.

Romantic Relationships
Adolescence is the developmental period during which romantic relationships typically first
emerge. By the end of adolescence, most American teens have had at least one romantic
relationship (Dolgin, 2011). However, culture does play a role as Asian Americans and Latinas
are less likely to date than other ethnic groups (Connolly, Craig, Goldberg, & Pepler, 2004).
Dating serves many purposes for teens, including having fun, companionship, status,
socialization, sexual experimentation, intimacy, and partner selection for those in late
adolescence (Dolgin, 2011).
There are several stages in the dating process beginning with engaging in mixed-sex group
activities in early adolescence (Dolgin, 2011). The same-sex peer groups that were common
during childhood expand into mixed-sex peer groups that are more characteristic of adolescence.
Romantic relationships often form in the context of these mixed-sex peer groups (Connolly,
Furman, & Konarski, 2000). Interacting in mixed-sex groups is easier for teens as they are
among a supportive group of friends, can observe others interacting, and are kept safe from a too
early intimate relationship. By middle adolescence teens are engaging in brief, casual dating or
in group dating with established couples (Dolgin, 2011). Then in late adolescence dating
involves exclusive, intense relationships. These relationships tend to be long-lasting and
continue for a year or longer, however, they may also interfere with friendships.

239

Although romantic relationships during
adolescence are often short-lived rather than
long-term committed partnerships, their
importance should not be minimized.
Adolescents spend a great deal of time focused
on romantic relationships, and their positive
and negative emotions are more tied to
romantic relationships, or lack thereof, than to
friendships, family relationships, or school
(Furman & Shaffer, 2003). Romantic
relationships contribute to adolescents’
identity formation, changes in family and peer
relationships, and emotional and behavioral
adjustment.

Furthermore, romantic relationships are centrally connected to adolescents’ emerging sexuality.
Parents, policymakers, and researchers have devoted a great deal of attention to adolescents’
sexuality, in large part because of concerns related to sexual intercourse, contraception, and
preventing teen pregnancies. However, sexuality involves more than this narrow focus. For
example, adolescence is often when individuals who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender
come to perceive themselves as such (Russell, Clarke, & Clary, 2009). Thus, romantic
relationships are a domain in which adolescents experiment with new behaviors and identities.
However, a negative dating relationship can adversely affect an adolescent’s development. Soller
(2014) explored the link between relationship inauthenticity and mental health. Relationship
inauthenticity refers to an incongruence between thoughts/feelings and actions within a
relationship. Desires to gain partner approval and demands in the relationship may negatively
affect an adolescent’s sense of authenticity. Soller found that relationship inauthenticity was
positively correlated with poor mental health, including depression, suicidal ideation and suicide
attempts, especially for females.

Chapter 7: Emerging and Early Adulthood
Historically, early adulthood spanned from approximately 18 (the end of adolescence) until 40 to
45 (beginning of middle adulthood). More recently, developmentalists have divided this age
period into two separate stages: Emerging adulthood followed by early adulthood. Although
these age periods differ in their physical, cognitive, and social development, overall the age
period from 18 to 45 is a time of peak physical capabilities and the emergence of more mature
cognitive development, financial independence, and intimate relationships.

Emerging Adulthood Defined
Emerging adulthood is the period between the late teens and early twenties; ages 18-25, although
some researchers have included up to age 29 in the definition (Society for the Study of Emerging
Adulthood, 2016). Jeffrey Arnett (2000) argues that emerging adulthood is neither adolescence
nor is it young adulthood. Individuals in this age period have left behind the relative dependency
of childhood and adolescence but have not yet taken on the responsibilities of adulthood.
“Emerging adulthood is a time of life when many different directions remain possible, when
little about the future is decided for certain, when the scope of independent exploration of life’s
possibilities is greater for most people than it will be at any other period of the life course”
(Arnett, 2000, p. 469). Arnett identified five characteristics of emerging adulthood that
distinguished it from adolescence and young adulthood (Arnett, 2006).
•

It is the age of identity exploration. In 1950, Erik Erikson proposed that it was during
adolescence that humans wrestled with the question of identity. Yet, even Erikson (1968)
commented on a trend during the 20th century of a “prolonged adolescence” in
industrialized societies. Today, most identity development occurs during the late teens
and early twenties rather than adolescence. It is during emerging adulthood that people
are exploring their career choices and ideas about intimate relationships, setting the
foundation for adulthood.

•

Arnett also described this time period as the age of instability (Arnett, 2000; Arnett,
2006). Exploration generates uncertainty and instability. Emerging adults change jobs,
relationships, and residences more frequently than other age groups.

246

•

This is also the age of self-focus. Being self-focused is not the same as being “selfcentered.” Adolescents are more self-centered than emerging adults. Arnett reports that
in his research, he found emerging adults to be very considerate of the feelings of others,
especially their parents. They now begin to see their parents as people not just parents,
something most adolescents fail to do (Arnett, 2006). Nonetheless, emerging adults
focus more on themselves, as they realize that they have few obligations to others and
that this is the time where they can do what they want with their life.

•

This is also the age of feeling inFigure 7.1
between. When asked if they feel
like adults, more 18 to 25 year-olds
answer “yes and no” than do teens or
adults over the age of 25 (Arnett,
2001). Most emerging adults have
gone through the changes of puberty,
are typically no longer in high school,
and many have also moved out of
their parents’ home. Thus, they no
longer feel as dependent as they did as
teenagers. Yet, they may still be
Source
financially dependent on their parents
to some degree, and they have not
completely attained some of the indicators of adulthood, such as finishing their education,
obtaining a good full-time job, being in a committed relationship, or being responsible for
others. It is not surprising that Arnett found that 60% of 18 to 25 year-olds felt that in
some ways they were adults, but in some ways, they were not (Arnett, 2001).

•

Emerging adulthood is the age of possibilities. It is a time period of optimism as more 18
to 25 year-olds feel that they will someday get to where they want to be in life. Arnett
(2000, 2006) suggests that this optimism is because these dreams have yet to be tested.
For example, it is easier to believe that you will eventually find your soul mate when you
have yet to have had a serious relationship. It may also be a chance to change directions,
for those whose lives up to this point have been difficult. The experiences of children
and teens are influenced by the choices and decisions of their parents. If the parents are
dysfunctional, there is little a child can do about it. In emerging adulthood, people can
move out and move on. They have the chance to transform their lives and move away
from unhealthy environments. Even those whose lives were happier and more fulfilling
as children, now have the opportunity in emerging adulthood to become independent and
make decisions about the direction they would like their life to take.

Socioeconomic Class and Emerging Adulthood: The theory of emerging adulthood was
initially criticized as only reflecting upper middle-class, college-attending young adults in the
United States and not those who were working class or poor (Arnett, 2016). Consequently,
Arnett reviewed results from the 2012 Clark University Poll of Emerging Adults, whose
participants were demographically similar to the United States population. Results primarily
indicated consistencies across aspects of the theory, including positive and negative perceptions
247

of the time-period and views on education, work, love, sex, and marriage. Two significant
differences were found, the first being that emerging adults from lower socioeconomic classes
identified more negativity in their emotional lives, including higher levels of depression.
Secondly, those in the lowest socioeconomic group were more likely to agree that they had not
been able to find sufficient financial support to obtain the education they believed they needed.
Overall, Arnett concluded that emerging adulthood exists wherever there is a period between the
end of adolescence and entry into adult roles, but acknowledging social, cultural, and historical
contexts was also important.

Cultural Variations
The five features proposed in the theory of emerging adulthood originally were based on
research involving about Americans between ages 18 and 29 from various ethnic groups, social
classes, and geographical regions (Arnett, 2004, 2016). To what extent does the theory of
emerging adulthood apply internationally?
Figure 7.2

Source

The answer to this question depends greatly on what part of the
world is considered. Demographers make a useful distinction
between the developing countries that comprise the majority of
the world’s population and the economically developed
countries that are part of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), including the United
States, Canada, Western Europe, Japan, South Korea,
Australia, and New Zealand. The current population of OECD
countries (also called developed countries) is 1.2 billion, about
18% of the total world population (United Nations
Development Programme, 2011). The rest of the human
population resides in developing countries, which have much
lower median incomes, much lower median educational
attainment, and much higher incidence of illness, disease, and
early death. Let us consider emerging adulthood in other
OECD countries as little is known about the experiences of 1825 year-olds in developing countries.

The same demographic changes as described above for the United States have taken place in
other OECD countries as well. This is true of participation in postsecondary education, as well as
median ages for entering marriage and parenthood (UNdata, 2010). However, there is also
substantial variability in how emerging adulthood is experienced across OECD countries. Europe
is the region where emerging adulthood is longest and most leisurely. The median ages for
entering marriage and parenthood are near 30 in most European countries (Douglass, 2007).
Europe today is the location of the most affluent, generous, and egalitarian societies in the world,
in fact, in human history (Arnett, 2007). Governments pay for tertiary education, assist young
people in finding jobs, and provide generous unemployment benefits for those who cannot find
work. In northern Europe, many governments also provide housing support. Emerging adults in
European societies make the most of these advantages, gradually making their way to adulthood
during their twenties while enjoying travel and leisure with friends.
248

The lives of Asian emerging adults in developed countries, such as Japan and South Korea, are in
some ways similar to the lives of emerging adults in Europe and in some ways strikingly
different. Like European emerging adults, Asian emerging adults tend to enter marriage and
parenthood around age 30 (Arnett, 2011). Like European emerging adults, Asian emerging adults
in Japan and South Korea enjoy the benefits of living in affluent societies with generous social
welfare systems that provide support for them in making the transition to adulthood, including
free university education and substantial unemployment benefits.
However, in other ways, the experience of emerging adulthood in Asian OECD countries is
markedly different than in Europe. Europe has a long history of individualism, and today’s
emerging adults carry that legacy with them in their focus on self-development and leisure
during emerging adulthood. In contrast, Asian cultures have a shared cultural history
emphasizing collectivism and family obligations.
Although Asian cultures have become more
individualistic in recent decades, as a
consequence of globalization, the legacy of
collectivism persists in the lives of emerging
adults. They pursue identity explorations and
self-development during emerging adulthood,
like their American and European counterparts,
but within narrower boundaries set by their
sense of obligations to others, especially their
parents (Phinney & Baldelomar, 2011). For
example, in their views of the most important
criteria for becoming an adult, emerging adults
Is your culture one that promotes romantic relationships for
in the United States and Europe consistently
emerging adults? Or does it encourage you to wait till
rank financial independence among the most
you’re older? What would it be like to live in the opposite
important markers of adulthood. In contrast,
culture? [Image: Patrick Rodwell]
emerging adults with an Asian cultural
background especially emphasize becoming capable of supporting parents financially as among
the most important criteria (Arnett, 2003; Nelson, Badger, & Wu, 2004). This sense of family
obligation may curtail their identity explorations in emerging adulthood to some extent, as they
pay more heed to their parents’ wishes about what they should study, what job they should take,
and where they should live than emerging adults do in the West (Rosenberger, 2007).
Figure 7.3

When Does Adulthood Begin?
According to Rankin and Kenyon (2008), historically the process of becoming an adult was more
clearly marked by rites of passage. For many, marriage and parenthood were considered entry
into adulthood. However, these role transitions are no longer considered the important markers
of adulthood (Arnett, 2001). Economic and social changes have resulted in more young adults
attending college (Rankin & Kenyon, 2008) and a delay in marriage and having children (Arnett
& Taber, 1994; Laursen & Jensen-Campbell, 1999) Consequently, current research has found
financial independence and accepting responsibility for oneself to be the most important markers
of adulthood in Western culture across age (Arnett, 2001) and ethnic groups (Arnett, 2004).
249

In looking at college students’ perceptions of adulthood, Rankin and Kenyon (2008) found that
some students still view rites of passage as important markers. College students who had placed
more importance on role transition markers, such as parenthood and marriage, belonged to a
fraternity/sorority, were traditionally aged (18–25), belonged to an ethnic minority, were of a
traditional marital status; i.e., not cohabitating, or belonged to a religious organization,
particularly for men. These findings supported the view that people holding collectivist or more
traditional values place more importance on role transitions as markers of adulthood. In contrast,
older college students and those cohabitating did not value role transitions as markers of
adulthood as strongly.

Young Adults Living Arrangements

Figure 7.4

In 2014, for the first time in more than 130 years,
adults 18 to 34 were more likely to be living in their
parents’ home than they were to be living with a
spouse or partner in their own household (Fry, 2016).
The current trend is that young Americans are not
choosing to settle down romantically before age 35.
Since 1880, living with a romantic partner was the
most common living arrangement among young adults.
In 1960, 62% of America’s 18- to 34-year-olds were
living with a spouse or partner in their own household,
while only 20% were living with their parents.
Figure 7.5

Source

By 2014, 31.6% of early adults were living with a
spouse or partner in their own household, while
32.1% were living in the home of their parent(s).
Another 14% of early adults lived alone, were a
single parent, or lived with one or more roommates.
The remaining 22% lived in the home of another
family member (such as a grandparent, in-law, or
sibling), a non-relative, or in group quarters (e.g.,
college dormitories). Comparing ethnic groups, 36%
of black and Hispanic early adults lived at home,
while 30% of white young adults lived at home.
As can be seen in Figure 7.5, gender differences in
living arrangements are also noted in that young men
were living with parents at a higher rate than young
women. In 2014, 35% of young me were residing
with their parents, while 28% were living with a
spouse or partner in their own household. Young
women were more likely to be living with a spouse
or partner (35%) than living with their parents
(29%). Additionally, more young women (16%) than
young men (13%) were heading up a household
without a spouse or partner, primarily because
250

women are more likely to be single parents living with their children. Lastly, young men (25%)
were more likely than young women (19%) to be living in the home of another family member, a
non-relative, or in some type of group quarters (Fry, 2016).
What are some factors that help explain these changes in living arrangements? First, early
adults are postponing marriage or choosing not to marry or cohabitate. Lack of employment and
lower wages have especially contributed to males residing with their parents. Men who are
employed are less likely to live at home. Wages for young men (adjusting for inflation) have
been falling since 1970 and correlate with the rise in young men living with their parents. The
recent recession and recovery (2007-present) has also contributed to the increase in early adults
living at home. College enrollments increased during the recession, which further increased
early adults living at home. However, once early adults possess a college degree, they are more
likely to establish their own households (Fry, 2016).

The Physiological Peak
People in their mid-twenties to mid-forties are considered to be in early adulthood. By the time
we reach early adulthood, our physical maturation is complete, although our height and weight
may increase slightly. Those in their early twenties are probably at the peak of their
physiological development, including muscle strength, reaction time, sensory abilities, and
cardiac functioning. The reproductive system, motor skills, strength, and lung capacity are all
operating at their best. Most professional athletes are at the top of their game during this stage,
and many women have children in the early-adulthood years (Boundless, 2016).
The aging process actually begins during early adulthood. Around the age of 30, many changes
begin to occur in different parts of the body. For example, the lens of the eye starts to stiffen and
thicken, resulting in changes in vision (usually affecting the ability to focus on close objects).
251

Sensitivity to sound decreases; this happens twice as quickly for men as for women. Hair can
start to thin and become gray around the age of 35, although this may happen earlier for some
individuals and later for others. The skin becomes drier and wrinkles start to appear by the end of
early adulthood. This includes a decline in response time and the ability to recover quickly from
physical exertion. The immune system also becomes less adept at fighting off illness, and
reproductive capacity starts to decline (Boundless, 2016).

Obesity
Although at the peak of physical health, a concern for early adults is the current rate of obesity.
Results from the National Center for Health Statistics indicated that an estimated 70.7% of U.S.
adults aged 20 and over were overweight in 2012 (CDC, 2015b) and by 2016, 39.8% were
considered obese (Hales, Carroll, Fryar, & Ogden, 2017)). Body mass index (BMI), expressed
as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared (kg/m2), is commonly used to classify
overweight (BMI 25.0–29.9), obesity (BMI greater than or equal to 30.0), and extreme obesity
(BMI greater than or equal to 40.0). The current statistics are an increase from the 2013-2014
statistics that indicated that an estimated 35.1% were obese, and 6.4% extremely obese (Fryar,
Carroll, & Ogden, 2014). The CDC also indicated that one’s 20s are the prime time to gain
weight as the average person gains one to two pounds per year from early adulthood into middle
adulthood. The average man in his 20s weighs around 185 pounds and by his 30s weighs
approximately 200 pounds. The average American woman weighs 162 pounds in her 20s and
170 pounds in her 30s.
The American obesity crisis is also reflected
Figure 7.6 Waist Circumference
worldwide (Wighton, 2016). In 2014, global obesity
rates for men were measured at 10.8% and among
women 14.9%. This translates to 266 million obese
men and 375 million obese women in the world, and
more people were identified as obese than
underweight. Although obesity is seen throughout
the world, more obese men and women live in China
and the USA than in any other country. Figure 7.6
illustrates how waist circumference is also used as a
measure of obesity. Figure 7.7 demonstrates the
percentage growth for youth (2-19 years) and adults
(20-60+ years) identified as obese between 1999 and
2016.
Causes of Obesity: According to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (2016), obesity
originates from a complex set of contributing factors,
including one’s environment, behavior, and genetics. Societal factors include culture, education,
food marketing and promotion, the quality of food, and the physical activity environment
available. Behaviors leading to obesity include diet, the amount of physical activity, and
medication use. Lastly, there does not appear to be a single gene responsible for obesity. Rather,
research has identified variants in several genes that may contribute to obesity by increasing
hunger and food intake. Another genetic explanation is the mismatch between today’s
environment and "energy-thrifty genes" that multiplied in the distant past, when food sources
Source

252

were unpredictable. The genes that helped our ancestors survive occasional famines are now
being challenged by environments in which food is plentiful all the time. Overall, obesity most
likely results from complex interactions among the environment and multiple genes.

Obesity
Health Consequences: Obesity is considered to be one of the leading causes of death in
the United States and worldwide. Additionally, the medical care costs of obesity in the United
States were estimated to be $147 billion in 2008. According to the CDC (2016) compared to
those with a normal or healthy weight, people who are obese are at increased risk for many
serious diseases and health conditions including:

•

All-causes of death (mortality)
High blood pressure (Hypertension)
High LDL cholesterol, low HDL cholesterol, or high levels of triglycerides (Dyslipidemia)
Type 2 diabetes
Coronary heart disease
Stroke
Gallbladder disease
Osteoarthritis (a breakdown of cartilage and bone within a joint)
Sleep apnea and breathing problems
Some cancers (endometrial, breast, colon, kidney, gallbladder, and liver)

A Healthy, But Risky Time
Doctor’s visits are less frequent in early adulthood than for those in midlife and late adulthood
and are necessitated primarily by injury and pregnancy (Berger, 2005). However, the top five
causes of death in emerging and early adulthood are non-intentional injury (including motor
vehicle accidents), homicide, and suicide with cancer and heart disease completing the list
(Heron, & Smith, 2007). Rates of violent death (homicide, suicide, and accidents) are highest
among young adult males, and vary by race and ethnicity. Rates of violent death are higher in the
United States than in Canada, Mexico, Japan, and other selected countries. Males are 3 times
more likely to die in auto accidents than are females (Frieden, 2011).
Alcohol Abuse: A significant contributing factor to risky behavior is alcohol. According to the
2014 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and
Alcoholism (NIAAA), 2016) 88% of people ages 18 or older reported that they drank alcohol at
some point in their lifetime; 71% reported that they drank in the past year; and 57% reported
drinking in the past month. Additionally, 6.7% reported that they engaged in heavy drinking in
the past month. Heavy drinking is defined as drinking five or more drinks on the same occasion
on each of five or more days in the past 30 days. Nearly 88,000 people (approximately 62,000
men and 26,000 women) die from alcohol-related causes annually, making it the fourth leading
preventable cause of death in the United States. In 2014, alcohol-impaired driving fatalities
accounted for 9,967 deaths (31% of overall driving fatalities).
The NIAAA defines binge drinking when blood alcohol concentration levels reach 0.08 g/dL.
This typically occurs after four drinks for women and five drinks for men in approximately two
hours. In 2014, 25% of people ages 18 or older reported that they engaged in binge drinking in
the past month. According to the NIAAA (2015) “Binge drinking poses serious health and
safety risks, including car crashes, drunk-driving arrests, sexual assaults, and injuries. Over the
long term, frequent binge drinking can damage the liver and other organs,” (p. 1).
Alcohol and College Students: Results from the 2014 survey demonstrated a difference
between the amount of alcohol consumed by college students and those of the same age who are
not in college (NIAAA, 2016). Specifically, 60% of full-time college students’ ages 18–22
drank alcohol in the past month compared with 51.5% of other persons of the same age not in
college. In addition, 38% of college students’ ages 18–22 engaged in binge drinking; that is, five
or more drinks on one occasion in the past month, compared with 33.5% of other persons of the
same age. Lastly, 12% of college students’ (ages 18–22) engaged in heavy drinking; that is,
binge drinking on five or more occasions per month, in the past month. This compares with
9.5% of other emerging adults not in college.
The consequences for college drinking are staggering, and the NIAAA (2016) estimates that each
year the following occur:
•
•
•

1,825 college students between the ages of 18 and 24 die from alcohol-related
unintentional injuries, including motor-vehicle crashes.
696,000 students between the ages of 18 and 24 are assaulted by another student who has
been drinking.
Roughly 1 in 5 college students meet the criteria for an Alcohol Use Disorder.
254

•
•

About 1 in 4 college students report academic consequences from drinking, including
missing class, falling behind in class, doing poorly on exams or papers, and receiving
lower grades overall. (p. 1)
97,000 students between the ages of 18 and 24 report experiencing alcohol-related sexual
assault or date rape.

The role alcohol plays in predicting acquaintance rape on college campuses is of particular
concern. “Alcohol use in one the strongest predictors of rape and sexual assault on college
campuses,” (Carroll, 2016, p. 454). Krebs, Lindquist, Warner, Fisher and Martin (2009) found
that over 80% of sexual assaults on college campuses involved alcohol. Being intoxicated
increases a female’s risk of being the victim of date or acquaintance rape (Carroll,
2007). Females are more likely to blame themselves and to be blamed by others if they were
intoxicated when raped. College students view perpetrators who were drinking as less
responsible, and victims who were drinking as more responsible for the assaults (Untied,
Orchowski, Mastroleo, & Gidycz, 2012).
Factors Affecting College
Students’ Drinking: Several
factors associated with college life
affect a student’s involvement
with alcohol (NIAAA, 2015).
These include the pervasive
availability of alcohol,
inconsistent enforcement of
underage drinking laws,
unstructured time, coping with
stressors, and limited interactions
with parents and other adults.
Due to social pressures to conform
and expectations when entering
college, the first six weeks of
Source
freshman year are an especially
susceptible time for students. Additionally, more drinking occurs in colleges with active
Greek systems and athletic programs. Alcohol consumption is lowest among students living
with their families and commuting, while it is highest among those living in fraternities and
sororities.
Figure 7.8

College Strategies to Curb Drinking: Strategies to address college drinking involve the
individual-level and campus community as a whole. Identifying at-risk groups, such as first
year students, members of fraternities and sororities, and athletes has proven helpful in
changing students’ knowledge, attitudes, and behavior regarding alcohol (NIAAA, 2015).
Interventions include education and awareness programs, as well as intervention by health
professionals. At the college-level, reducing the availability of alcohol has proven effective by
decreasing both consumption and negative consequences.

255

Non-Alcohol Substance Use: Illicit drug use
Figure 7.9
peaks between the ages of 19 and 22 and then
begins to decline. Additionally, 25% of those
who smoke cigarettes, 33% of those who smoke
marijuana, and 70% of those who abuse cocaine
began using after age 17 (Volkow, 2004).
Emerging adults (18 to 25) are the largest
abusers of prescription opioid pain relievers,
anti-anxiety medications, and Attention Deficit
Hyperactivity Disorder medication (National
Institute on Drug Abuse, 2015). In 2016, opioid
misuse within the past 12 months was reported
by 3.6% of 12-17 year-olds and was twice as
Source
high among those 18-25 (Office of Adolescent
Health, 2019). In 2014 more than 1700 emerging
adults died from a prescription drug overdose. This is an increase of four times since 1999.
Additionally, for every death there were 119 emergency room visits.
Daily marijuana use is at the highest level in
three decades (National Institute on Drug
Abuse, 2015). For those in college, 2014 data
indicate that 6% of college students smoke
marijuana daily, while only 2% smoked daily
in 1994. For noncollege students of the same
age, the daily percentage is twice as high
(approximately 12%). Additionally,
according to a recent survey by the National
Institute of Drug Abuse (2018), daily cigarette
smoking is lower for those in college in
comparison to non-college groups (see Figure
7.10).

Figure 7.10

Rates of violent death are influenced by
substance use which peaks during emerging
Source
and early adulthood. Drugs impair judgment,
reduce inhibitions, and alter mood, all of
which can lead to dangerous behavior. Reckless driving, violent altercations, and forced sexual
encounters are some examples. Drug and alcohol use increase the risk of sexually transmitted
infections because people are more likely to engage in risky sexual behavior when under the
influence. This includes having sex with someone who has had multiple partners, having anal sex
without the use of a condom, having multiple partners, or having sex with someone whose
history is unknown. Lastly, as previously discussed, drugs and alcohol ingested during
pregnancy have a teratogenic effect on the developing embryo and fetus.

256

Gender
As previously discussed in chapter 4, gender is the cultural, social and psychological meanings
associated with masculinity and feminity. A person’s sense of self as a member of a particular
gender is known as gender identity. Because gender is considered a social construct, meaning
that it does not exist naturally, but is instead a concept that is created by cultural and societal
norms, there are cultural variations on how people express their gender identity. For example, in
American culture, it is considered feminine to wear a dress or skirt. However, in many Middle
Eastern, Asian, and African cultures, dresses or skirts (often referred to as sarongs, robes, or
gowns) can be considered masculine. Similarly, the kilt worn by a Scottish male does not make
him appear feminine in his culture.
For many adults, the drive to adhere to masculine and feminine gender roles, or the societal
expectations associated with being male or female, continues throughout life. In American
culture, masculine roles have traditionally been associated with strength, aggression, and
dominance, while feminine roles have traditionally been associated with passivity, nurturing, and
subordination. Men tend to outnumber women in professions such as law enforcement, the
military, and politics, while women tend to outnumber men in care-related occupations such as
childcare, healthcare, and social work. These occupational roles are examples of stereotypical
American male and female behavior, derived not from biology or genetics, but from our culture's
traditions. Adherence to these roles may demonstrate fulfillment of social expectations, however,
not necessarily personal preferences (Diamond, 2002).
Consequently, many adults are challenging gender labels and roles, and the long-standing
gender binary; that is, categorinzing humans as only female and male, has been undermined by
current psychological research (Hyde, Bigler, Joel, Tate, & van Anders, 2019). The term gender
now encompasses a wide range of possible identities, including cisgender, transgender, agender,
genderfluid, genderqueer, gender nonconforming, bigender, pangender, ambigender, nongendered, intergender, and Two-spirit which is a modern umbrella term used by some
indigenous North Americans to describe gender-variant individuals in their communities
(Carroll, 2016). Hyde et al. (2019) advocates for a conception of gender that stresses multiplicity
and diversity and uses multiple categories that are not mutually exclusive.
Gender Minority Discrimination: Gender
nonconforming people are much more likely to
experience harassment, bullying, and violence
based on their gender identity; they also
experience much higher rates of discrimination in
housing, employment, healthcare, and education
(Borgogna, McDermott, Aita, & Kridel, 2019;
National Center for Transgender Equality, 2015).
Transgender individuals of color face additional
financial, social, and interpersonal challenges, in
comparison to the transgender community as a
whole, as a result of structural racism. Black
transgender people reported the highest level of
257

Figure 7.11 Transgender Flag

discrimination among all transgender individuals of color. As members of several intersecting
minority groups, transgender people of color, and transgender women of color in particular, are
especially vulnerable to employment discrimination, poor health outcomes, harassment, and
violence. Consequently, they face even greater obstacles than white transgender individuals and
cisgender members of their own race.
Gender Minority Status and Mental Health: Using data from
over 43,000 college students, Borgona et al. (2019) examined
mental health differences among several gender groups,
including those identifying as cisgender, transgender and gender
nonconforming. Results indicated that participants who
identified as transgender and gender nonconforming had
significantly higher levels of anxiety and depression than those
identifying as cisgender. Bargona et al. explained the higher
rates of anxiety and depression using the minority stress model,
which states that an unaccepting social environment results in
both external and internal stress which contributes to poorer
mental health. External stressors include discrimination,
harassment, and prejudice, while internal stressors include
negative thoughts, feelings and emotions resulting from one’s
Source
identity. Borgona et al. recommends that mental health services
that are sensitive to both gender minority and sexual minority statatus be available.
Figure 7.12

The transgender children discussed in chapter 4 may, when they become an adult, alter their
bodies through medical interventions, such as surgery and hormonal therapy, so that their
physical being is better aligned with gender identity. However, not all transgender individuals
choose to alter their bodies or physically transition. Many will maintain their original anatomy
but may present themselves to society as a different gender, often by adopting the dress,
hairstyle, mannerisms, or other characteristics typically assigned to a certain gender. It is
important to note that people who cross-dress, or wear clothing that is traditionally assigned to
the opposite gender, such as transvestites, drag kings, and drag queens, do not necessarily
identify as transgender (though some do). People often confuse the term transvestite, which is
the practice of dressing and acting in a style or manner traditionally associated with another sex
(APA, 2013) with transgender. Cross-dressing is typically a form of self-expression,
entertainment, or personal style, and not necessarily an expression about one's gender identity.

Sexuality
Human sexuality refers to people's sexual interest in and attraction to others, as well as their
capacity to have erotic experiences and responses. Sexuality may be experienced and expressed
in a variety of ways, including thoughts, fantasies, desires, beliefs, attitudes, values, behaviors,
practices, roles, and relationships. These may manifest themselves in biological, physical,
emotional, social, or spiritual aspects. The biological and physical aspects of sexuality largely
concern the human reproductive functions, including the human sexual-response cycle and the
basic biological drive that exists in all species. Emotional aspects of sexuality include bonds
between individuals that are expressed through profound feelings or physical manifestations of
258

love, trust, and care. Social aspects deal with the effects of human society on one's sexuality,
while spirituality concerns an individual's spiritual connection with others through sexuality.
Sexuality also impacts, and is impacted by cultural, political, legal, philosophical, moral, ethical,
and religious aspects of life.
The Sexual Response Cycle: Sexual motivation, often referred to as libido, is a person's overall
sexual drive or desire for sexual activity. This motivation is determined by biological,
psychological, and social factors. In most mammalian species, sex hormones control the ability
to engage in sexual behaviors. However, sex hormones do not directly regulate the ability to
copulate in primates (including humans); rather, they are only one influence on the motivation to
engage in sexual behaviors. Social factors, such as work and family, also have an impact, as do
internal psychological factors like personality and stress. Sex drive may also be affected by
hormones, medical conditions, medications, lifestyle stress, pregnancy, and relationship issues.
The sexual response cycle is a model that describes the physiological responses that take place
during sexual activity. According to Kinsey, Pomeroy, and Martin (1948), the cycle consists of
four phases: excitement, plateau, orgasm, and resolution. The excitement phase is the phase in
which the intrinsic (inner) motivation to pursue sex arises. The plateau phase is the period of
sexual excitement with increased heart rate and circulation that sets the stage for orgasm.
Orgasm is the release of tension, and the resolution period is the unaroused state before the
cycle begins again.
The Brain and Sex: The brain is the structure that translates the nerve impulses from the skin
into pleasurable sensations. It controls nerves and muscles used during sexual behavior. The
brain regulates the release of hormones, which are believed to be the physiological origin of
sexual desire. The cerebral cortex, which is the outer layer of the brain that allows for thinking
and reasoning, is believed to be the origin of sexual thoughts and fantasies. Beneath the cortex is
the limbic system, which consists of the amygdala, hippocampus, cingulate gyrus, and septal
area. These structures are where emotions and feelings are believed to originate, and they are
important for sexual behavior.
The hypothalamus is the most important part of the brain for sexual functioning. This is the
small area at the base of the brain consisting of several groups of nerve-cell bodies that receives
input from the limbic system. Studies with lab animals have shown that destruction of certain
areas of the hypothalamus causes complete elimination of sexual behavior. One of the reasons
for the importance of the hypothalamus is that it controls the pituitary gland, which secretes
hormones that control the other glands of the body.

259

Figure 7.13

Hormones: Several important sexual hormones are secreted by the pituitary gland. Oxytocin,
also known as the hormone of love, is released during sexual intercourse when an orgasm is
achieved. Oxytocin is also released in females when they give birth or are breast feeding; it is
believed that oxytocin is involved with maintaining close relationships. Both prolactin and
oxytocin stimulate milk production in females. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is
responsible for ovulation in females by triggering egg maturity; it also stimulates sperm
production in males. Luteinizing hormone (LH) triggers the release of a mature egg in females
during the process of ovulation.
In males, testosterone appears to be a major contributing factor to sexual motivation.
Vasopressin is involved in the male arousal phase, and the increase of vasopressin during
erectile response may be directly associated with increased motivation to engage in sexual
behavior.
The relationship between hormones and female sexual motivation is not as well understood,
largely due to the overemphasis on male sexuality in Western research. Estrogen and
progesterone typically regulate motivation to engage in sexual behavior for females, with
estrogen increasing motivation and progesterone decreasing it. The levels of these hormones
rise and fall throughout a woman's menstrual cycle. Research suggests that testosterone,
oxytocin, and vasopressin are also implicated in female sexual motivation in similar ways as they
are in males, but more research is needed to understand these relationships.
Sexual Responsiveness Peak: Men and women tend to reach their peak of sexual
responsiveness at different ages. For men, sexual responsiveness tends to peak in the late teens
and early twenties. Sexual arousal can easily occur in response to physical stimulation or
fantasizing. Sexual responsiveness begins a slow decline in the late twenties and into the thirties,
260

although a man may continue to be sexually active. Through time, a man may require more
intense stimulation in order to become aroused. Women often find that they become more
sexually responsive throughout their 20s and 30s and may peak in the late 30s or early 40s. This
is likely due to greater self-confidence and reduced inhibitions about sexuality.
Sexually Transmitted Infections: Sexually transmitted infections (STIs), also referred to as
sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) or venereal diseases (VDs), are illnesses that have a
significant probability of transmission by means of sexual behavior, including vaginal
intercourse, anal sex, and oral sex. Some STIs can also be contracted by sharing intravenous
drug needles with an infected person, as well as through childbirth or breastfeeding.
Common STIs include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

chlamydia;
herpes (HSV-1 and HSV-2);
human papillomavirus (HPV);
gonorrhea;
syphilis;
trichomoniasis;
HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) and AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome).

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (2014), there was an
increase in the three most common types of STDs in 2014. These include 1.4 million cases of
chlamydia, 350,000 cases of gonorrhea, and 20,000 cases of syphilis. Those most affected by
STDS include those younger, gay/bisexual males, and females. The most effective way to
prevent transmission of STIs is to practice safe sex and avoid direct contact of skin or fluids
which can lead to transfer with an infected partner. Proper use of safe-sex supplies (such as male
condoms, female condoms, gloves, or dental dams) reduces contact and risk and can be effective
in limiting exposure; however, some disease transmission may occur even with these barriers.
Societal Views on Sexuality: Society's views on sexuality are influenced by everything from
religion to philosophy, and they have changed throughout history and are continuously evolving.
Historically, religion has been the greatest influence on sexual behavior in the United States;
however, in more recent years, peers and the media have emerged as two of the strongest
influences, particularly among American teens (Potard, Courtois, & Rusch, 2008).
Mass media in the form of television, magazines, movies, and music continues to shape what is
deemed appropriate or normal sexuality, targeting everything from body image to products
meant to enhance sex appeal. Media serves to perpetuate a number of social scripts about sexual
relationships and the sexual roles of men and women, many of which have been shown to have
both empowering and problematic effects on people's (especially women's) developing sexual
identities and sexual attitudes.
Cultural Differences: In the West, premarital sex is normative by the late teens, more than a
decade before most people enter marriage. In the United States and Canada, and in northern and
eastern Europe, cohabitation is also normative; most people have at least one cohabiting
261

partnership before marriage. In southern Europe, cohabiting is still taboo, but premarital sex is
tolerated in emerging adulthood. In contrast, both premarital sex and cohabitation remain rare
and forbidden throughout Asia. Even dating is discouraged until the late twenties, when it would
be a prelude to a serious relationship leading to marriage. In cross-cultural comparisons, about
three fourths of emerging adults in the United States and Europe report having had premarital
sexual relations by age 20, versus less than one fifth in Japan and South Korea (Hatfield &
Rapson, 2006).
Sexual Orientation: A person's sexual orientation is their emotional and sexual attraction to a
particular gender. It is a personal quality that inclines people to feel romantic or sexual attraction
(or a combination of these) to persons of a given sex or gender. According to the American
Psychological Association (APA) (2016), sexual orientation also refers to a person's sense of
identity based on those attractions, related behaviors, and membership in a community of others
who share those attractions. Sexual orientation is independent of gender; for example, a
transgender person may identify as heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, pansexual, polysexual,
asexual, or any other kind of sexuality, just like a cisgender person.
Sexual Orientation on a Continuum: Sexuality
researcher Alfred Kinsey was among the first to
conceptualize sexuality as a continuum rather than a
strict dichotomy of gay or straight. To classify this
continuum of heterosexuality and homosexuality,
Kinsey et al. (1948) created a seven-point rating scale
that ranged from exclusively heterosexual to
exclusively homosexual. Research done over several
decades has supported this idea that sexual orientation
ranges along a continuum, from exclusive attraction to
the opposite sex/gender to exclusive attraction to the
same sex/gender (Carroll, 2016).

Figure 7.14

However, sexual orientation now can be defined in
Source
many ways. Heterosexuality, which is often referred to
as being straight, is attraction to individuals of the
opposite sex/gender, while homosexuality, being gay
or lesbian, is attraction to individuals of one's own
sex/gender. Bisexuality was a term traditionally used
to refer to attraction to individuals of either male or
female sex, but it has recently been used in nonbinary
models of sex and gender (i.e., models that do not
Source
assume there are only two sexes or two genders) to
refer to attraction to any sex or gender. Alternative
terms such as pansexuality and polysexuality have also been developed, referring to attraction
to all sexes/genders and attraction to multiple sexes/genders, respectively (Carroll, 2016).
Asexuality refers to having no sexual attraction to any sex/gender. According to Bogaert (2015)
about one percent of the population is asexual. Being asexual is not due to any physical
262

problems, and the lack of interest in sex does not cause the individual any distress. Asexuality is
being researched as a distinct sexual orientation.
Development of Sexual Orientation: According to current scientific understanding, individuals
are usually aware of their sexual orientation between middle childhood and early adolescence.
However, this is not always the case, and some do not become aware of their sexual orientation
until much later in life. It is not necessary to participate in sexual activity to be aware of these
emotional, romantic, and physical attractions; people can be celibate and still recognize their
sexual orientation. Some researchers argue that sexual orientation is not static and inborn but is
instead fluid and changeable throughout the lifespan.
There is no scientific consensus regarding the exact reasons why an individual holds a particular
sexual orientation. Research has examined possible biological, developmental, social, and
cultural influences on sexual orientation, but there has been no evidence that links sexual
orientation to only one factor (APA, 2016). However, biological explanations, that include
genetics, birth order, and hormones will be explored further as many scientists support biological
processes occurring during the embryonic and and early postnatal life as playing the main role in
sexual orientation (Balthazart, 2018).
Figure 7.15

Source

Genetics: Using both twin and familial studies,
heredity provides one biological explanation for
same-sex orientation. Bailey and Pillard (1991)
studied pairs of male twins and found that the
concordance rate for identical twins was 52%,
while the rate for fraternal twins was only 22%.
Bailey, Pillard, Neale, and Agyei (1993) studied
female twins and found a similar difference with a
concordance rate of 48% for identical twins and
16% for fraternal twins. Schwartz, Kim,
Kolundzija, Rieger, & Sanders (2010) found that
gay men had more gay male relatives than straight
men, and sisters of gay men were more likely to be
lesbians than sisters of straight men.

Fraternal Birth Order: The fraternal birth order effect indicates that the probability of a boy
identifying as gay increases for each older brother born to the same mother (Balthazart, 2018;
Blanchard, 2001). According to Bogaret et al. “the increased incidence of homosexuality in
males with older brothers results from a progressive immunization of the mother against a male
specific cell-adhesion protein that plays a key role in cell-cell interactions, specifically in the
process of synapse formation,” (as cited in Balthazart, 2018, p. 234). A meta-analysis indicated
that the fraternal birth order effect explains the sexual orientation of between 15% and 29% of
gay men.
Hormones: Excess or deficient exposure to hormones during prenatal development has also
been theorized as an explanation for sexual orientation. One-third of females exposed to
abnormal amounts of prenatal androgens, a condition called congenital adrenal hyperplasia
(CAH), identify as bisexual or lesbian (Cohen-Bendahan, van de Beek, & Berenbaum, 2005). In
263

contrast, too little exposure to prenatal androgens may affect male sexual orientation by not
masculinizing the male brain (Carlson, 2011).
Sexual Orientation Discrimination: The United States is heteronormative, meaning that
society supports heterosexuality as the norm. Consider, for example, that homosexuals are often
asked, "When did you know you were gay?" but heterosexuals are rarely asked, "When did you
know you were straight?" (Ryle, 2011). Living in a culture that privileges heterosexuality has a
significant impact on the ways in which non-heterosexual people are able to develop and express
their sexuality.
Open identification of one's sexual
orientation may be hindered by
homophobia which encompasses
a range of negative attitudes and
feelings toward homosexuality or
people who are identified or
perceived as being lesbian, gay,
bisexual, or transgender (LGBT).
It can be expressed as antipathy,
contempt, prejudice, aversion, or
hatred; it may be based on
irrational fear and is sometimes
related to religious beliefs (Carroll,
2016). Homophobia is observable
in critical and hostile behavior,
such as discrimination and
violence on the basis of sexual
orientations that are nonheterosexual. Recognized types of
homophobia include
Source
institutionalized homophobia,
such as religious and state-sponsored homophobia, and internalized homophobia in which
people with same-sex attractions internalize, or believe, society's negative views and/or hatred of
themselves.
Figure 7.16

Sexual minorities regularly experience stigma, harassment, discrimination, and violence based
on their sexual orientation (Carroll, 2016). Research has shown that gay, lesbian, and bisexual
teenagers are at a higher risk of depression and suicide due to exclusion from social groups,
rejection from peers and family, and negative media portrayals of homosexuals (Bauermeister et
al., 2010). Discrimination can occur in the workplace, in housing, at schools, and in numerous
public settings. Much of this discrimination is based on stereotypes and misinformation. Major
policies to prevent discrimination based on sexual orientation have only come into effect in the
United States in the last few years.
The majority of empirical and clinical research on LGBT populations are done with largely
white, middle-class, well-educated samples. This demographic limits our understanding of more
264

marginalized sub-populations that are also affected by racism, classism, and other forms of
oppression. In the United States, non-Caucasian LGBT individuals may find themselves in a
double minority, in which they are not fully accepted or understood by Caucasian LGBT
communities and are also not accepted by their own ethnic group (Tye, 2006). Many people
experience racism in the dominant LGBT community where racial stereotypes merge with
gender stereotypes.

Beyond Formal Operational Thought: Postformal Thought
As mentioned in chapter 6, according to Piaget’s theory adolescents acquire formal operational
thought. The hallmark of this type of thinking is the ability to think abstractly or to consider
possibilities and ideas about circumstances never directly experienced. Thinking abstractly is
only one characteristic of adult thought, however. If you compare a 15 year-old with someone in
their late 30s, you would probably find that the latter considers not only what is possible, but also
what is likely. Why the change? The adult has gained experience and understands why
possibilities do not always become realities. They learn to base decisions on what is realistic and
practical, not idealistic, and can make adaptive choices. Adults are also not as influenced by
what others think. This advanced type of thinking is referred to as Postformal Thought
(Sinnott, 1998).
Dialectical Thought: In addition to moving toward more practical considerations, thinking in
early adulthood may also become more flexible and balanced. Abstract ideas that the adolescent
believes in firmly may become standards by which the adult evaluates reality. Adolescents tend
to think in dichotomies; ideas are true or false; good or bad; and there is no middle
ground. However, with experience, the adult comes to recognize that there is some right and
some wrong in each position, some good or some bad in a policy or approach, some truth and
some falsity in a particular idea. This ability to bring together salient aspects of two opposing
viewpoints or positions is referred to as dialectical thought and is considered one of the most
advanced aspects of postformal thinking (Basseches, 1984). Such thinking is more realistic
because very few positions, ideas, situations, or people are completely right or wrong. So, for
example, parents who were considered angels or devils by the adolescent eventually become just
people with strengths and weaknesses, endearing qualities, and faults to the adult.

265

Does everyone reach postformal or even formal operational thought? Formal operational
thought involves being able to think abstractly; however, this ability does not apply to all
situations or all adults. Formal operational thought is influenced by experience and
education. Some adults lead lives in which they are not challenged to think abstractly about their
world. Many adults do not receive any formal education and are not taught to think abstractly
about situations they have never experienced. Further, they are also not exposed to conceptual
tools used to formally analyze hypothetical situations. Those who do think abstractly may be
able to do so more easily in some subjects than others. For example, psychology majors may be
able to think abstractly about psychology but be unable to use abstract reasoning in physics or
chemistry. Abstract reasoning in a particular field requires a knowledge base we might not have
in all areas. Consequently, our ability to think abstractly often depends on our experiences.

Education
According to the National Center for Higher Education Management Systems (NCHEMS)
(2016a, 2016b, 2016c, 2016d), in the United States:
• 84% of 18 to 24 year olds and 88% of those 25 and older have a high school diploma or
its equivalent
• 36% of 18 to 24 year olds and 7% of 25 to 49 year olds attend college
• 59% of those 25 and older have completed some college
• 32.5% of those 25 and older have a bachelor’s degree or higher, with slightly more
women (33%) than men (32%) holding a college degree (Ryan & Bauman, 2016).
The rate of college attainment has grown more slowly in the United States than in a number of
other nations in recent years (OCED, 2014). This may be due to fact that the cost of attaining a
degree is higher in the U.S. than in many other nations.
In 2017, 65% of college seniors who graduated from private and public nonprofit colleges had
student loan debt, and nationally owed an average of $28,650, a 1% decline from 2016 (The
Institute for College Access & Success (TICAS), 2018). See Figure 7.17 for yearly comparisons.

Figure 7.17 Average Debt Borrowed of Graduating Seniors

Adapted from TICAS, 2018

266

According to the most recent TICAS annual report, the rate of debt varied widely across states,
as well as between colleges. The after graduation debt ranged from 18,850 in Utah to $38,500 in
Connecticut. Low-debt states are mainly in the West, and high-debt states in the Northeast. In
recent years there has been a concern about students carrying more debt and being more likely to
default when attending for-profit institutions. In 2016, students at for-profit schools borrowed an
average of $39,900, which was 41% higher than students at non-profit schools that year. In
addition, 30% of students attending for-profit colleges default on their federal student loans. In
contrast, the default level of those who attended public institutions is only 4% (TICAS, 2018).

College student debt has become
a key issue at both the state and
federal political level, and some
states have been taking steps to
increase spending and grants to
help students with the cost of
college. However, 15% of the
Class of 2017’s college debt was
owed to private lenders (TICAS,
2018). Such debt has less
consumer protection, fewer
options for repayment, and is
typically negotiated at a higher
interest rate. See Table 7.1 for a
debt comparison of 6 U.S. States.

Graduate School: Larger amounts of student debt actually occur at the graduate level
(Kreighbaum, 2019). In 2019, the highest average debts were concentrated in the medical fields.
Average median debt for graduate programs included:
• $42,335 for a master’s degree
• $95,715 for a doctoral degree
• $141,000 for a professional degree
Worldwide, over 80% of college educated adults are employed, compared with just over 70% of
those with a high school or equivalent diploma, and only 60% of those with no high school
diploma (OECD, 2015). Those with a college degree will earn more over the course of their life
time. Moreover, the benefits of college education go beyond employment and finances. The
OECD found that around the world, adults with higher educational attainment were more likely
to volunteer, felt they had more control over their lives, and thus were more interested in the
world around them. Studies of U.S. college students find that they gain a more distinct identity
and become more socially competent, less dogmatic and ethnocentric compared to those not in
college (Pascarella, 2006).
Is college worth the time and investment? College is certainly a substantial investment each
year, with the financial burden falling on students and their families in the U.S., and mainly by
the government in many other nations. Nonetheless, the benefits both to the individual and the
society outweighs the initial costs. As can be seen in Figure 7.18, those in America with the most
advanced degrees earn the highest income and have the lowest unemployment.

Career Development and Employment
Work plays a significant role in the lives of people, and emerging and early adulthood is the time
when most of us make choices that will establish our careers. Career development has a number
of stages:
•
•
•

•

Stage One: As children we may select careers based on what appears glamorous or
exciting to us (Patton & McMahon, 1999). There is little regard in this stage for whether
we are suited for our occupational choices.
Stage Two: In the second stage, teens include their abilities and limitations, in addition to
the glamour of the occupation when narrowing their choices.
Stage Three: Older teens and emerging adults narrow their choices further and begin to
weigh more objectively the requirements, rewards, and downsides to careers, along with
comparing possible careers with their own interests, values, and future goals (Patton &
McMahon, 1999). However, some young people in this stage “fall-into” careers simply
because these were what were available at the time, because of family pressures to pursue
particular paths, or because these were high paying jobs, rather than from an intrinsic
interest in that career path (Patton & McMahon, 1999).
Stage Four: Super (1980) suggests that by our mid to late thirties, many adults settle in
their careers. Even though they might change companies or move up in their position,
there is a sense of continuity and forward motion in their career. However, some people
268

at this point in their working life may feel trapped, especially if there is little opportunity
for advancement in a more dead-end job.
How have things changed for Millennials compared with previous generations of early
adults? In recent years, young adults are more likely to find themselves job-hopping, and
periodically returning to school for further education and retraining than in prior generations.
However, researchers find that occupational interests remain fairly stable. Thus, despite the
more frequent change in jobs, most people are generally seeking jobs with similar interests rather
than entirely new careers (Rottinghaus, Coon, Gaffey & Zytowski, 2007). As of 2016,
millennials became the largest generation in the labor force (Fry, 2018) (See Figure 7.19).
Figure 7.19

Recent research also suggests that Millennials are looking for something different in their place
of employment. According to a recent Gallup poll report (2016), Millennials want more than a
paycheck, they want a purpose. Unfortunately, only 29% of Millennials surveyed by Gallup
reported that they were “engaged” at work. In fact, they report being less engaged than Gen
Xers and Baby Boomers; with 55% of Millennials saying they are not engaged at all with their
job. This indifference to their workplace may explain the greater tendency to switch jobs. With
their current job giving them little reason to stay, they are more likely to take any new
opportunity to move on. Only half of Millennials saw themselves working at the same company
a year later. Gallup estimates that this employment turnover and lack of engagement costs
businesses $30.5 billion a year.
NEETs: Around the world, teens and young adults were some of the hardest hit by the
economic downturn in recent years (Desilver, 2016). Consequently, a number of young people
have become NEETs, neither employed nor in education or training. While the number of
young people who are NEETs has declined more recently, there is concern that “without
assistance, economically inactive young people won’t gain critical job skills and will never fully
integrate into the wider economy or achieve their full earning potential” (Desilver, 2016, para.
3). In parts of the world where the rates of NEETs are persistently high, there is also concern that
269

having such large numbers of young adults with little opportunity may increase the chances of
social unrest.

In the United States, in 2017 over 13% of
15 to 29 year-olds were neither employed
nor in school, (Organisation for Economic
Cooperation and Development, (OECD),
2019). This is down from 2013, when
approximately 18.5% of this age group fit
the category (Desilver, 2016). More young
women than men in the United States find
themselves unemployed and not in school
or training for a job. Additionally, most
NEETs have high school or less education,
and Asians are less likely to be NEETs than
any other ethnic group in the US (Desilver,
2016).
The rate of NEETs varies around the world,
with higher rates found in nations that have
been the hardest hit by economic
recessions, and government austerity
measures. The number of NEETs also
varies widely between the genders,
although females are more likely to be
NEETs in all nations (see Table 7.2).

Adapted from OCED 2019

What role does gender play on career and employment? Gender also has an impact on career
choices. Despite the rise in the number of women who work outside of the home, there are some
career fields that are still pursued more by men than women. Jobs held by women still tend to
cluster in the service sector, such as education, nursing, and child-care worker. While in more
technical and scientific careers, women are greatly outnumbered by men. Jobs that have been
traditionally held by women tend to have lower status, pay, benefits, and job security (Bosson, et
al., 2019). In recent years, women have made inroads into fields once dominated by males, and
today women are almost as likely as men to become medical doctors or lawyers. Despite these
changes, women are more likely to have lower-status, and thus less pay than men in these
professions. For instance, women are more likely to be a family practice doctor than a surgeon or
are less likely to make partner in a law firm (Ceci & Williams, 2007).

Sexism
Sexism or gender discrimination is prejudice or discrimination based on a person's sex or
gender (Bosson, Vandello, & Buckner, 2019). Sexism can affect any sex that is marginalized or
oppressed in a society; however, it is particularly documented as affecting females. It has been
linked to stereotypes and gender roles and includes the belief that males are intrinsically superior
to other sexes and genders. Extreme sexism may foster sexual harassment, rape, and other forms
of sexual violence.
270

Sexism can exist on a societal level, such as in hiring, employment opportunities, and education.
In the United States, women are less likely to be hired or promoted in male-dominated
professions, such as engineering, aviation, and construction (Blau, Ferber, & Winkler, 2010;
Ceci & Williams, 2011). In many areas of the world, young girls are not given the same access to
nutrition, healthcare, and education as boys. Sexism also includes people’s expectations of how
members of a gender group should behave. For example, women are expected to be friendly,
passive, and nurturing; when a woman behaves in an unfriendly or assertive manner, she may be
disliked or perceived as aggressive because she has violated a gender role (Rudman, 1998). In
contrast, a man behaving in a similarly unfriendly or assertive way might be perceived as strong
or even gain respect in some circumstances.
Occupational sexism involves discriminatory
practices, statements, or actions, based on a person's
sex, that occur in the workplace. One form of
occupational sexism is wage discrimination. In 2008,
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) found that while female
employment rates have expanded, and gender
employment and wage gaps have narrowed nearly
everywhere, on average women still have a 20
percent less chance to have a job. The Council of
Economic Advisors (2015) found that despite
women holding 49.3% of the jobs, they are paid only
78 cents for every $1.00 a man earns. It also found
Source
that despite the fact that many countries, including
the U.S., have established anti-discrimination laws,
these laws are difficult to enforce. A recent example of significant wage inequality occurred
among athletes.
Figure 7.20

2019 Women’s World Cup: The world witnessed the tremendous athleticism and soccer skills
demonstrated by female players from 24 different countries during the 2019 Women’s World
Cup. Amid the cheering at the end of the final match between the United States and the
Netherlands, were chants of “equal pay” (Channick, 2019). Throughout the tournament,
attention was focused on the discrepancy between what male soccer players earned compared to
the female players. In winning the World Cup, the American women’s team earned $4 million as
part of a $30 million prize pool (Peterson, 2019). In contrast, the French men’s team, who won
the Men’s World Cup in 2018, earned $38 million as part of the $400 million prize pool. The
Federation of Association Football (FIFA) promised to double the prize money to $60 million for
the 2023 Women’s World Cup, but that still lags far behind the $440 million that will be given
out for the Men’s World Cup in 2022. In the United States, the women’s soccer team generates
more revenue and receives higher TV ratings than the men’s team, yet the women get paid

271

Figure 7.21 Megan Rapinoe and

States Women’s Soccer Team

significantly less. By winning the 2019 Women’s World
Cup, each woman should receive $200,000, yet if the
American men had won the 2018 Men’s World Cup, each
would have received $1.1 million (Hess, 2019). Because of
this discrepancy, in March 2019, 28 members of the
women’s team filed a lawsuit against the United States
Soccer Federation for gender discrimination and unequal
pay (Channick, 2019).

Factors Affecting Wage Inequality: There are many
possible explanations for the wage gap. It has been argued
in the past that education may account for the wage gap.
However, the wage gap exists at every of education level
(Bosson et al., 2019). Men with less than high school to
men with graduate degree earn more than women with the
same level of education. In addition, women now attain
more associates, bachelor’s, and master’s degrees than men,
and very similar levels of professional degrees and

doctorates, according to a recent Census survey (U.S.
Census Bureau, 2019). As the wage gap still exists in most
occupations it cannot be the explanation. Instead, occupational segregation is a likely contributor
to the overall wage gap, as women tend to work in very different occupations than men, and
those jobs tend to have lower wages. In addition, the entry of women into a field tends to reduce
the wages and prestige of the job. Mandel (2013) found that jobs typically held by men who saw
the biggest influx of women into those careers, also saw the biggest drop in wages.

women paid more than men on average; stock clerk. Men are not only being paid more in more
masculine jobs, but also in jobs typically held by women.

Other factors include that more than half of men report having negotiated their salary when being
hired, compared with 12% of women (Babcock, Gelfand, Small, & Stayn, 2006). However,
people perceive women who negotiate more negatively then they do men, as assertive women,
but not men, are more likely to be penalized. Women are also more likely to have interruptions
in their careers either through the birth of children, or relocation due to a change in their
partner’s job. Women are also less likely to relocate for the sake of their families when a better
job offer comes along, and employers know this. It has been suggested that one reason why
males may be offered more money is to keep them from leaving (Baldridge, Eddleston, & Vega,
2006). Aditionally, men are more likely to work overtime.
Barriers to Positions of Power: There are a few barriers to women achieving positions of
power. The glass ceiling is the invisible barrier that keeps women and minorities from rising to
higher positions regardless of their qualifications (Bosson et al., 2019). Women hold only 4.5%
of CEO positions and 14% of top executive positions around the world (Noland, Moran, &
Kotschwar, 2016). In addition, Noland and colleagues found that in a study of nearly 22,000
companies worldwide, in 77% of those firms only 30% of women held an executive position or
board seat. There were only 11 companies, or 0.05% of all the firms studied, where women held
all the executive positions and board seats. Some researchers see the root cause of this situation
in the tacit discrimination based on gender, conducted by current top executives and corporate
directors, who are primarily male.
Often the barriers to achieving one’s goals are not obvious. For instance, some argue that the
gender role stereotypes cast managerial positions as “masculine”. Unfortunately, when women
do rise to positions of power it is often at a time when a company or country is faced with a
major crisis. This is called the glass cliff, and it refers to women and minorities being placed in
leadership positions when the risk of failure is high. For instance, female lawyers are more likely
than their male counterparts to lead a high-risk cases, and female politicians are more likely to be
recommended to run in unwinnable seats (Bruckmuller, Ryan, Floor, & Haslam, 2014).
Worldwide Gender Parity: The World Economic Forum (2017) introduced The Global Gender
Gap Report in 2006 as way of tracking gender based disparities between men and women in the
world. The most recent report in 2017 analyzed 144 countries on gender equality in the areas of:
economic participation and opportunity, educational attainment, health and survival, and political
empowerment. Countries are then ranked to create global awareness of the challenges posed by
gender gaps in different areas of the world. A parity rating of 100% would mean that females and
males achieved equality on these measures. Results indicated:
• 68% gender parity was found worldwide across the four areas. Specifically, there was
96% parity in health outcomes, 95% parity in educational attainment, 58% parity in
economic participation, and only 23% parity in political empowerment.
• The top spots were held by smaller Western European countries, particularly the Nordic
countries as Iceland (88% parity), Norway (83% parity) and Finland (82% parity)
occupied the top three positions.
• The United States ranked 49th with 72% gender parity.
• Following the current trends, it will take 100 years for global gender parity.
• Improving gender parity is expected to provide significant economic gains for a country
and closing the occupational gender gaps would be one way to achieve this.

Temperament and Personality in Adulthood
If you remember from chapter 3, temperament is defined as the innate characteristics of the
infant, including mood, activity level, and emotional reactivity, noticeable soon after birth. Does
one’s temperament remain stable through the lifespan? Do shy and inhibited babies grow up to
be shy adults, while the sociable child continues to be the life of the party? Like most
developmental research the answer is more complicated than a simple yes or no. Chess and
Thomas (1987), who identified children as easy, difficult, slow-to-warm-up or blended, found
that children identified as easy grew up to became well-adjusted adults, while those who
exhibited a difficult temperament were not as well-adjusted as adults. Kagan (2002) studied the
temperamental category of inhibition to the unfamiliar in children. Infants exposed to
unfamiliarity reacted strongly to the stimuli and cried loudly, pumped their limbs, and had an
increased heart rate. Research has indicated that these highly reactive children show
temperamental stability into early childhood, and Bohlin and Hagekull (2009) found that shyness
in infancy was linked to social anxiety in adulthood.
An important aspect of this research on inhibition was looking at the response of the amygdala,
which is important for fear and anxiety, especially when confronted with possible threatening
events in the environment. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRIs) young adults
identified as strongly inhibited toddlers showed heightened activation of the amygdala when
compared to those identified as uninhibited toddlers (Davidson & Begley, 2012).
The research does seem to indicate that temperamental stability holds for many individuals
through the lifespan, yet we know that one’s environment can also have a significant impact.
Recall from our discussion on epigenesis or how environmental factors are thought to change
gene expression by switching genes on and off. Many cultural and environmental factors can
affect one’s temperament, including supportive versus abusive child-rearing, socioeconomic
status, stable homes, illnesses, teratogens, etc. Additionally, individuals often choose
environments that support their temperament, which in turn further strengthens them (Cain,
2012). In summary, because temperament is genetically driven, genes appear to be the major
274

reason why temperament remains stable into adulthood. In contrast, the environment appears
mainly responsible for any change in temperament (Clark & Watson, 1999).
Everybody has their own unique personality; that is, their characteristic manner of thinking,
feeling, behaving, and relating to others (John, Robins, & Pervin, 2008). Personality traits refer
to these characteristic, routine ways of thinking, feeling, and relating to others. Personality
integrates one’s temperament with cultural and environmental influences. Consequently, there
are signs or indicators of these traits in childhood, but they become particularly evident when the
person is an adult. Personality traits are integral to each person’s sense of self, as they involve
what people value, how they think and feel about things, what they like to do, and, basically,
what they are like most every day throughout much of their lives.

Table 7.4 Descriptions of the Big Five Personality Traits
Dimension

Description

Examples of behaviors predicted by the trait

Openness to
experience

A general appreciation for art,
emotion, adventure, unusual ideas,
imagination, curiosity, and variety
of experience

Individuals who are highly open to experience tend to have
distinctive and unconventional decorations in their home.
They are also likely to have books on a wide variety of
topics, a diverse music collection, and works of art on
display.

Conscientiousness A tendency to show selfdiscipline, act dutifully, and aim
for achievement

Individuals who are conscientious have a preference for
planned rather than spontaneous behavior.

Extraversion

The tendency to experience
positive emotions and to seek out
stimulation and the company of
others

Extroverts enjoy being with people. In groups they like to
talk, assert themselves, and draw attention to themselves.

Agreeableness

A tendency to be compassionate
and cooperative rather than
suspicious and antagonistic toward
others; reflects individual
differences in general concern for
social harmony

Agreeable individuals value getting along with others.
They are generally considerate, friendly, generous, helpful,
and willing to compromise their interests with those of
others.

Neuroticism

The tendency to experience
negative emotions, such as anger,
anxiety, or depression; sometimes
called “emotional instability”

Those who score high in neuroticism are more likely to
interpret ordinary situations as threatening and minor
frustrations as hopelessly difficult. They may have trouble
thinking clearly, making decisions, and coping effectively
with stress.

Adapted from John, Naumann, and Soto (2008)

Five-Factor Model: There are hundreds of different personality traits, and all of these traits can
be organized into the broad dimensions referred to as the Five-Factor Model (John, Naumann, &
275

Soto, 2008). These five broad domains include: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion,
Agreeableness, and Neuroticism (Think OCEAN to remember). This applies to traits that you
may use to describe yourself. Table 7.4 provides illustrative traits for low and high scores on the
five domains of this model of personality.
Does personality change throughout adulthood? Previously the answer was no, but
contemporary research shows that although some people’s personalities are relatively stable over
time, others’ are not (Lucas & Donnellan, 2011; Roberts & Mroczek, 2008). Longitudinal studies
reveal average changes during adulthood in the expression of some traits (e.g., neuroticism and
openness decrease with age and conscientiousness increases) and individual differences in these
patterns due to idiosyncratic life events (e.g., divorce, illness). Longitudinal research also
suggests that adult personality traits, such as conscientiousness, predict important life outcomes
including job success, health, and longevity (Friedman et al., 1993; Roberts, Kuncel, Shiner,
Caspi, & Goldberg, 2007).
The Harvard Health Letter (2012) identifies research correlations between conscientiousness and
lower blood pressure, lower rates of diabetes and stroke, fewer joint problems, being less likely
to engage in harmful behaviors, being more likely to stick to healthy behaviors, and more likely
to avoid stressful situations. Conscientiousness also appears related to career choices,
friendships, and stability of marriage. Lastly, a person possessing both self-control and
organizational skills, both related to conscientiousness, may withstand the effects of aging better
and have stronger cognitive skills than one who does not possess these qualities.

Attachment in Young Adulthood
Table 7.5
Which of the following best describes you in your romantic relationships?

Secure
Avoidant

Anxious/Ambivalent

I find it relatively easy to get close to others and am comfortable
depending on them and having them depend on me. I don’t often worry
about being abandoned or about someone getting too close to me.
I am somewhat uncomfortable being close to others; I find it difficult to
trust them completely, difficult to allow myself to depend on them. I am
nervous when anyone gets too close, and often, love partners want me to
be more intimate than I feel comfortable being.
I find that others are reluctant to get as close as I would like. I often
worry that my partner doesn’t really love me or won’t stay with me. I
want to merge completely with another person, and this sometimes scares
people away.

Source

Hazan and Shaver (1987) described the attachment styles of adults, using the same three general
categories proposed by Ainsworth’s research on young children: secure, avoidant, and
anxious/ambivalent. Hazan and Shaver developed three brief paragraphs describing the three
adult attachment styles. Adults were then asked to think about romantic relationships they were
in and select the paragraph that best described the way they felt, thought, and behaved in these
relationships (See Table 7.5).
276

Bartholomew (1990) challenged the categorical view of attachment in adults and suggested that
adult attachment was best described as varying along two dimensions; attachment related-anxiety
and attachment-related avoidance. Attachment-related anxiety refers to the extent to which an
adult worries about whether their partner really loves them. Those who score high on this
dimension fear that their partner will reject or abandon them (Fraley, Hudson, Heffernan, &
Segal, 2015). Attachment-related avoidance refers to whether an adult can open up to others,
and whether they trust and feel they can depend on others. Those who score high on attachmentrelated avoidance are uncomfortable with opening up and may fear that such dependency may
limit their sense of autonomy (Fraley et al., 2015). According to Bartholomew (1990) this would
yield four possible attachment styles in adults; secure, dismissing, preoccupied, and fearfulavoidant (see Figure 7.22)
Securely attached adults score
lower on both dimensions. They
are comfortable trusting their
partners and do not worry
excessively about their partner’s
love for them. Adults with a
dismissing style score low on
attachment-related anxiety, but
higher on attachment-related
avoidance. Such adults dismiss
the importance of relationships.
They trust themselves, but do
not trust others, thus do not
share their dreams, goals, and
fears with others. They do not
depend on other people and feel
uncomfortable when they have
to do so.

Those with a preoccupied attachment are low in attachment-related avoidance, but high in
attachment-related anxiety. Such adults are often prone to jealousy and worry that their partner
does not love them as much as they need to be loved. Adults whose attachment style is fearfulavoidant score high on both attachment-related avoidance and attachment-related anxiety. These
adults want close relationships, but do not feel comfortable getting emotionally close to others.
They have trust issues with others and often do not trust their own social skills in maintaining
relationships.
Research on attachment in adulthood has found that:
•

•

Adults with insecure attachments report lower satisfaction in their relationships (Butzer,
& Campbell, 2008; Holland, Fraley, & Roisman, 2012).
Those high in attachment-related anxiety report more daily conflict in their relationships
(Campbell, Simpson, Boldry, & Kashy, 2005).
Those with avoidant attachment exhibit less support to their partners (Simpson, Rholes,
Oriña, & Grich, 2002).

Young adults show greater attachment-related anxiety than do middle-aged or older
adults (Chopik, Edelstein, & Fraley, 2013).
Some studies report that young adults show more attachment-related avoidance
(Schindler, Fagundes, & Murdock, 2010), while other studies find that middle-aged
adults show higher avoidance than younger or older adults (Chopik et al., 2013).
Young adults with more secure and positive relationships with their parents make the
transition to adulthood more easily than do those with more insecure attachments (Fraley,
2013).
Young adults with secure attachments and authoritative parents were less likely to be
depressed than those with authoritarian or permissive parents or who experienced an
avoidant or ambivalent attachment (Ebrahimi, Amiri, Mohamadlou, & Rezapur, 2017).

Do people with certain attachment styles attract those with similar styles? When people are
asked what kinds of psychological or behavioral qualities they are seeking in a romantic partner,
a large majority of people indicate that they are seeking someone who is kind, caring,
trustworthy, and understanding, that is the kinds of attributes that characterize a “secure”
caregiver (Chappell & Davis, 1998). However, we know that people do not always end up with
others who meet their ideals. Are secure people more likely to end up with secure partners, and,
vice versa, are insecure people more likely to end up with insecure partners? The majority of the
research that has been conducted to date suggests that the answer is “yes.” Frazier, Byer, Fischer,
Wright, and DeBord (1996) studied the attachment patterns of more than 83 heterosexual couples
and found that, if the man was relatively secure, the woman was also likely to be secure.
One important question is whether these findings exist because (a) secure people are more likely
to be attracted to other secure people, (b) secure people are likely to create security in their
partners over time, or (c) some combination of these possibilities. Existing empirical research
strongly supports the first alternative. For example, when people have the opportunity to interact
with individuals who vary in security in a speed-dating context, they express a greater interest in
those who are higher in security than those who are more insecure (McClure, Lydon, Baccus, &
Baldwin, 2010). However, there is also some evidence that people’s attachment styles mutually
shape one another in close relationships. For example, in a longitudinal study, Hudson, Fraley,
Vicary, and Brumbaugh (2012) found that, if one person in a relationship experienced a change
in security, his or her partner was likely to experience a change in the same direction.
Figure 7.23

Do early experiences as children shape adult
attachment? The majority of research on this issue is
retrospective; that is, it relies on adults’ reports of what
they recall about their childhood experiences. This kind of
work suggests that secure adults are more likely to
describe their early childhood experiences with their
parents as being supportive, loving, and kind (Hazan &
Shaver, 1987). A number of longitudinal studies are
emerging that demonstrate prospective associations
between early attachment experiences and adult
attachment styles and/or interpersonal functioning in
adulthood. For example, Fraley, Roisman, Booth278

LaForce, Owen, and Holland (2013) found in a sample of more than 700 individuals studied
from infancy to adulthood that maternal sensitivity across development prospectively predicted
security at age 18. Simpson, Collins, Tran, and Haydon (2007) found that attachment security,
assessed in infancy in the strange situation, predicted peer competence in grades one to three,
which, in turn, predicted the quality of friendship relationships at age 16, which, in turn,
predicted the expression of positive and negative emotions in their adult romantic relationships at
ages 20 to 23.
It is easy to come away from such findings with the mistaken assumption that early experiences
“determine” later outcomes. To be clear, attachment theorists assume that the relationship
between early experiences and subsequent outcomes is probabilistic, not deterministic. Having
supportive and responsive experiences with caregivers early in life is assumed to set the stage for
positive social development, but that does not mean that attachment patterns are set in stone. In
short, even if an individual has far from optimal experiences in early life, attachment theory
suggests that it is possible for that individual to develop well-functioning adult relationships
through a number of corrective experiences, including relationships with siblings, other family
members, teachers, and close friends. Security is best viewed as a culmination of a person’s
attachment history rather than a reflection of his or her early experiences alone. Those early
experiences are considered important, not because they determine a person’s fate, but because
they provide the foundation for subsequent experiences.

Relationships with Parents and Siblings
In early adulthood the parent-child relationship has to transition toward a relationship between
two adults. This involves a reappraisal of the relationship by both parents and young adults.
One of the biggest challenges for parents, especially during emerging adulthood, is coming to
terms with the adult status of their children. Aquilino (2006) suggests that parents who are
reluctant or unable to do so may hinder young adults’ identity development. This problem
becomes more pronounced when young adults still reside with their parents. Arnett (2004)
reported that leaving home often helped promote psychological growth and independence in
early adulthood.
Sibling relationships are one of the longest-lasting bonds in people’s lives. Yet, there is little
research on the nature of sibling relationships in adulthood (Aquilino, 2006). What is known is
that the nature of these relationships change, as adults have a choice as to whether they will
maintain a close bond and continue to be a part of the life of a sibling. Siblings must make the
same reappraisal of each other as adults, as parents have to with their adult children. Research
has shown a decline in the frequency of interactions between siblings during early adulthood, as
presumably peers, romantic relationships, and children become more central to the lives of
young adults. Aquilino (2006) suggests that the task in early adulthood may be to maintain
enough of a bond so that there will be a foundation for this relationship in later life. Those who
are successful can often move away from the “older-younger” sibling conflicts of childhood,
toward a more equal relationship between two adults. Siblings that were close to each other in
childhood are typically close in adulthood (Dunn, 1984, 2007), and in fact, it is unusual for
siblings to develop closeness for the first time in adulthood. Overall, the majority of adult sibling
relationships are close (Cicirelli, 2009).
279

Erikson: Intimacy vs. Isolation
Erikson’s (1950, 1968) sixth stage focuses on establishing intimate relationships or risking social
isolation. Intimate relationships are more difficult if one is still struggling with identity.
Achieving a sense of identity is a life-long process, as there are periods of identity crisis and
stability. However, once identity is established intimate relationships can be pursued. These
intimate relationships include acquaintanceships and friendships, but also the more important
close relationships, which are the long-term romantic relationships that we develop with another
person, for instance, in a marriage (Hendrick & Hendrick, 2000).

Factors influencing Attraction
Figure 7.24 Birds of a
Feather Flock Together

Because most of us enter into a close relationship at some point, it
is useful to know what psychologists have learned about the
principles of liking and loving. A major interest of psychologists
is the study of interpersonal attraction, or what makes people
like, and even love, each other.
Similarity: One important factor in attraction is a perceived
similarity in values and beliefs between the partners (Davis &
Rusbult, 2001). Similarity is important for relationships because it
is more convenient if both partners like the same activities and
because similarity supports one’s values. We can feel better about
ourselves and our choice of activities if we see that our partner
also enjoys doing the same things that we do. Having others like
and believe in the same things we do makes us feel validated in
our beliefs. This is referred to as consensual validation and is an
important aspect of why we are attracted to others.

Source:

Self-Disclosure: Liking is also enhanced by self-disclosure, the tendency to communicate
frequently, without fear of reprisal, and in an accepting and empathetic manner. Friends are
friends because we can talk to them openly about our needs and goals and because they listen
and respond to our needs (Reis & Aron, 2008). However, self-disclosure must be balanced. If we
open up about our concerns that are important to us, we expect our partner to do the same in
return. If the self-disclosure is not reciprocal, the relationship may not last.
Proximity: Another important determinant of liking is proximity, or the extent to which people
are physically near us. Research has found that we are more likely to develop friendships with
people who are nearby, for instance, those who live in the same dorm that we do, and even with
people who just happen to sit nearer to us in our classes (Back, Schmukle, & Egloff, 2008).
Proximity has its effect on liking through the principle of mere exposure, which is the tendency
to prefer stimuli (including, but not limited to people) that we have seen more frequently. The
effect of mere exposure is powerful and occurs in a wide variety of situations. Infants tend to
smile at a photograph of someone they have seen before more than they smile at a photograph of
280

someone they are seeing for the first time (Brooks-Gunn & Lewis, 1981), and people prefer sideto-side reversed images of their own faces over their normal (nonreversed) face, whereas their
friends prefer their normal face over the reversed one (Mita, Dermer, & Knight, 1977). This is
expected on the basis of mere exposure, since people see their own faces primarily in mirrors,
and thus are exposed to the reversed face more often.
Mere exposure may well have an evolutionary basis. We have an initial fear of the unknown, but
as things become familiar, they seem more similar and safer, and thus produce more positive
affect and seem less threatening and dangerous (Harmon-Jones & Allen, 2001; Freitas, Azizian,
Travers, & Berry, 2005). When the stimuli are people, there may well be an added effect. Familiar
people become more likely to be seen as part of the ingroup rather than the outgroup, and this
may lead us to like them more. Zebrowitz and her colleagues found that we like people of our
own race in part because they are perceived as similar to us (Zebrowitz, Bornstad, & Lee, 2007).

Friendships
In our twenties, intimacy needs may be met in friendships rather than with partners. This is
especially true in the United States today as many young adults postpone making long-term
commitments to partners, either in marriage or in cohabitation. The kinds of friendships shared
by women tend to differ from those shared by men (Tannen, 1990). Friendships between men are
more likely to involve sharing information, providing solutions, or focusing on activities rather
than discussion problems or emotions. Men tend to discuss opinions or factual information or
spend time together in an activity of mutual interest. Friendships between women are more likely
to focus on sharing weaknesses, emotions, or problems. Women talk about difficulties they are
having in other relationships and express their sadness, frustrations, and joys. These differences
in approaches lead to problems when men and women come together. She may want to vent
about a problem she is having; he may want to provide a solution and move on to some
activity. But when he offers a solution, she thinks he does not care. Friendships between men and
women become more difficult because of the unspoken question about whether the friendships
will lead to a romantic involvement. Consequently, friendships may diminish once a person has a
partner or single friends may be replaced with couple friends.

Love

Figure 7.25

Sternberg (1988) suggests that there are three
main components of love: Passion, intimacy, and
commitment (see Figure 7.25). Love relationships
vary depending on the presence or absence of
each of these components. Passion refers to the
intense, physical attraction partners feel toward
one another. Intimacy involves the ability the
share feelings, psychological closeness and
personal thoughts with the other. Commitment is
the conscious decision to stay together. Passion
can be found in the early stages of a relationship,
but intimacy takes time to develop because it is
281

Sternberg’s Triarchic Theory of Love

Source

based on knowledge of the partner. Once intimacy has been established, partners may resolve to
stay in the relationship. Although many would agree that all three components are important to a
relationship, many love relationships do not consist of all three. Let's look at other possibilities.
Liking: In this relationship, intimacy or knowledge of the other and a sense of closeness is
present. Passion and commitment, however, are not. Partners feel free to be themselves and
disclose personal information. They may feel that the other person knows them well and can be
honest with them and let them know if they think the person is wrong. These partners are
friends. However, being told that your partner “thinks of you as a friend” can be a devastating
blow if you are attracted to them and seeking a romantic involvement.
Infatuation: Perhaps, this is Sternberg's version of "love at first sight". Infatuation consists of an
immediate, intense physical attraction to someone. A person who is infatuated finds it hard to
think of anything but the other person. Brief encounters are played over and over in one's head; it
may be difficult to eat and there may be a rather constant state of arousal. Infatuation is rather
short-lived, however, lasting perhaps only a matter of months or as long as a year or so. It tends
to be based on physical attraction and an image of what one “thinks” the other is all about.
Fatuous Love: However, some people who have a strong physical attraction push for
commitment early in the relationship. Passion and commitment are aspects of fatuous
love. There is no intimacy and the commitment is premature. Partners rarely talk seriously or
share their ideas. They focus on their intense physical attraction and yet one, or both, is also
talking of making a lasting commitment. Sometimes this is out of a sense of insecurity and a
desire to make sure the partner is locked into the relationship.
Empty Love: This type of love may be found later in a relationship or in a relationship that was
formed to meet needs other than intimacy or passion, including financial needs, childrearing
assistance, or attaining/maintaining status. Here the partners are committed to staying in the
relationship for the children, because of a religious conviction, or because there are no
alternatives. However, they do not share ideas or feelings with each other and have no physical
attraction for one another.
Romantic Love: Intimacy and passion are components of romantic love, but there is no
commitment. The partners spend much time with one another and enjoy their closeness, but have
not made plans to continue. This may be true because they are not in a position to make such
commitments or because they are looking for passion and closeness and are afraid it will die out
if they commit to one another and start to focus on other kinds of obligations.
Companionate Love: Intimacy and commitment are the hallmarks of companionate love.
Partners love and respect one-another and they are committed to staying together. However, their
physical attraction may have never been strong or may have just died out over
time. Nevertheless, partners are good friends and committed to one another.
Consummate Love: Intimacy, passion, and commitment are present in consummate love. This is
often perceived by western cultures as “the ideal” type of love. The couple shares passion; the
spark has not died, and the closeness is there. They feel like best friends, as well as lovers, and
they are committed to staying together.

282

Adult Lifestyles
Singlehood: Being single is the most common lifestyle for people in their early 20s, and there
has been an increase in the number of adults staying single. In 1960, only about 1 in 10 adults
age 25 or older had never been married, in 2012 that had risen to 1 in 5 (Wang & Parker, 2014).
While just over half (53%) of unmarried adults say they would eventually like to get married, 32
percent are not sure, and 13 percent do not want to get married. It is projected that by the time
current young adults reach their mid-40s and 50s, almost 25% of them may not have married.
The U.S. is not the only country to see a rise in the number of single adults.
Table 7.6 lists some of the reasons young
adults give for staying single. In addition,

be reflected by changes in attitudes about
the importance of marriage. In a recent Pew Research survey of Americans, respondents were
asked to indicate which of the following statements came closer to their own views:
•
•

“Society is better off if people make marriage and having children a priority”
“Society is just as well off if people have priorities other than marriage and children”

Slightly more adults endorsed the second statement (50%) than those who chose the first (46%),
with the remainder either selecting neither, both equally, or not responding (Wang & Parker,
2014). Young adults age 18-29 were more likely to endorse this view than adults age 30 to 49;
67 percent and 53 percent respectively. In contrast, those age 50 or older were more likely to
endorse the first statement (53 percent).

Hooking Up: United States demographic changes have
significantly affected the romantic relationships among
emerging and early adults. As previously described, the
age for puberty has declined, while the times for one’s
first marriage and first child have been pushed to older
ages. This results in a “historically unprecedented time
gap where young adults are physiologically able to
reproduce, but not psychologically or socially ready to
settle down and begin a family and child rearing,”
(Garcia, Reiber, Massey, & Merriwether, 2012, p.
172). Consequently, according to Bogle (2007, 2008)
traditional forms of dating have shifted to more casual
hookups that involve uncommitted sexual encounters.

283

Even though most research on hooking up involves college students, 70% of sexually active 1221 year olds reported having had uncommitted sex during the past year (Grello, Welsh, Harper,
& Dickson, 2003). Additionally, Manning, Giordano and Longmore (2006) found that 61% of
sexually active seventh, ninth, and eleventh graders reported being involved in a sexual
encounter outside of a dating relationship.
Friends with Benefits: Hookups are different than those relationships that involve continued
mutual exchange. These relationships are often referred to as Friends with Benefits (FWB) or
“Booty Calls.” These relationships involve friends having casual sex without commitment.
Hookups do not include a friendship relationship. Bisson and Levine (2009) found that 60% of
125 undergraduates reported a FWB relationship. The concern with FWB is that one partner
may feel more romantically invested than the other (Garcia et al., 2012).
Hooking up Gender Differences: When asked about their motivation for hooking up, both
males and females indicated physical gratification, emotional gratification, and a desire to initiate
a romantic relationship as reasons (Garcia & Reiber, 2008). Although males and females are
more similar than different in their sexual behaviors, a consistent finding among the research is
that males demonstrate a greater permissiveness to casual sex (Oliver & Hyde, 1993). In another
study involving 16,288 individuals across 52 nations, males reported a greater desire of sexual
partner variety than females, regardless of relationship status or sexual orientation (Schmitt et al.,
2003). This difference can be attributed to gender role expectations for both males and females
regarding sexual promiscuity. Additionally, the risks of sexual behavior are higher for females
and include unplanned pregnancy, increased sexually transmitted diseases, and susceptibility to
sexual violence (Garcia et al., 2012).
Although hooking up relationships have become normalized for emerging adults, some research
indicates that the majority of both sexes would prefer a more traditional romantic relationship
(Garcia et al., 2012). Additionally, Owen and Fincham (2011) surveyed 500 college students
with experience with hookups, and 65% of women and 45% of men reported that they hoped
their hookup encounter would turn into a committed relationship. Further, 51% of women and
42% of men reported that they tried to discuss the possibility of starting a relationship with their
hookup partner. Casual sex has also been reported to be the norm among gay men, but they too
indicate a desire for romantic and companionate relationships (Clarke & Nichols, 1972).
Emotional Consequences of Hooking up: Concerns regarding hooking up behavior certainly
are evident in the research literature. One significant finding is the high comorbidity of hooking
up and substance use. Those engaging in non-monogamous sex are more likely to have used
marijuana, cocaine, and alcohol, and the overall risks of sexual activity are drastically increased
with the addition of alcohol and drugs (Garcia et al., 2012). Regret has also been expressed, and
those who had the most regret after hooking up also had more symptoms of depression (Welsh,
Grello, & Harper, 2006). Hook ups were also found to lower self-esteem, increase guilt, and
foster feelings of using someone or feeling used. Females displayed more negative reactions
than males, and this may be due to females identifying more emotional involvement in sexual
encounters than males.
Hooking up can best be explained by a biological, psychological, and social perspective.
Research indicates that emerging adults feel it is necessary to engage in hooking up behavior as
part of the sexual script depicted in the culture and media. Additionally, they desire sexual
284

gratification. However, they also want a more committed romantic relationship and may feel
regret with uncommitted sex.
Online Dating: The ways people are finding love has changed with the advent of the Internet.
Nearly 50 million Americans have tried an online dating website or mobile app (Bryant &
Sheldon, 2017). Online dating has also increased dramatically among those age 18 to 24.
Today, one in five emerging adults report using a mobile dating app, while in 2013 only 5% did,
and 27% report having used online dating, almost triple the rate in 2013 (Smith & Anderson,
2016).
Figure 7.27

According to a recent survey of couples who met online versus offline (Brown, 2019), those who
met online tended to have slightly different levels of education, and political views from their
partners, but, the biggest difference was that they were much more likely to come from different
racial and ethnic backgrounds (see Figure 7.27). This is not surprising as the average age of the
couples who met online was 36, while the average age of couple who met offline was 51. Young
adults are more likely to a relationship with people who are different from them, regardless of
how they met.
As Finkel, Burnette, and Scissors (2007) found, social networking sites and the Internet perform
three important tasks. Specifically, sites provide individuals with access to a database of other
individuals who are interested in meeting someone. Dating sites generally reduce issues of
proximity, as individuals do not have to be close in proximity to meet. Also, they provide a
medium in which individuals can communicate with others. Finally, some Internet dating
websites advertise special matching strategies, based on factors such as personality, hobbies, and
285

interests, to identify the “perfect match” for people looking for love online. Social networking
sites have provided opportunities for meeting others you would not have normally met.
However, social networking sites can also be forums for unsuspecting people to be duped, as the
person may not be who he or she says.
Online communication differs from face-to-face interaction in a number of ways. In face-to-face
meetings, people have many cues upon which to base their first impressions. A person’s looks,
voice, mannerisms, dress, scent, and surroundings all provide information in face-to-face
meetings, but in computer-mediated meetings, written messages are the only cues
provided. Fantasy is used to conjure up images of voice, physical appearance, mannerisms, and
so forth. The anonymity of online involvement makes it easier to become intimate without fear
of interdependence. When online, people tend to disclose more intimate details about themselves
more quickly. A shy person can open up without worrying about whether or not the partner is
frowning or looking away. Someone who has been abused may feel safer in virtual relationships.
It is easier to tell one’s secrets because there is little fear of loss. One can find a virtual partner
who is warm, accepting, and undemanding (Gwinnell, 1998), and exchanges can be focused
more on emotional attraction than physical appearance.
To evaluate what individuals are looking for online, Menkin, Robles, Wiley and Gonzaga (2015)
reviewed data from an eHarmony.com relationship questionnaire completed by a cross-sectional
representation of 5,434 new users. Their results indicated that users consistently valued
communication and characteristics, such as personality and kindness over sexual attraction.
Females valued communication over sexual attraction, even more when compared to males, and
older users rated sexual attraction as less important than younger users. Alterovitz and
Mendelsohn (2011) analyzed 600 Internet personal ads across the lifespan and found that men
sought physical attractiveness and offered status related information more than women, while
women were more selective than men and sought status more than men. These findings were
consistent with previous research on gender differences regarding the importance of
physical/sexual attraction.
Catfishing and other forms of scamming is an increasing concern for those who use dating and
social media sites and apps. Catfishing refers to “a deceptive activity involving the creation of a
fake online profile for deceptive purposes” (Smith, Smith, & Blazka, 2017, p. 33). Notre Dame
University linebacker Manti Ta’o fell victim to a catfishing scam. The young woman “Kekua”
who he had struck up an online relationship with was a hoax, and he was not the first person to
have been scammed by this fictitious woman. A number of US states have passed legislation to
address online impersonation, from stealing the information and creating a fake account of a real
person to the creation of a fictitious persona with the intent to defraud or harm others (National
Conference of State Legislatures, 2017).
Cohabitation: In American society, as well as in a number of other cultures, cohabitation has
become increasingly commonplace (Gurrentz, 2018). For many emerging adults, cohabitation
has become more commonplace than marriage, as can be seen in Figures 7.28. While marriage
is still a more common living arrangement for those 25-34, cohabitation has increased, while
marriage has declined, as can be seen in Figure 7.29. Gurrentz also found that cohabitation varies
by socioeconomic status. Those who are married tend to have higher levels of education, and
thus higher earnings, or earning potential.
286

Copen, Daniels, and
Mosher (2013) found that
from 1995 to 2010 the
median length of the
cohabitation relationship
had increased regardless
of whether the
relationship resulted in
marriage, remained intact,
or had since dissolved.

Based on Data from Copen et al., 2013.

Three explanations have been given for the rise of
cohabitation in Western cultures. The first notes
that the increase in individualism and secularism,
and the resulting decline in religious observance,
has led to greater acceptance and adoption of
cohabitation (Lesthaeghe & Surkyn, 1988).
Moreover, the more people view cohabitating
couples, the more normal this relationship
becomes, and the more couples who will then
cohabitate. Thus, cohabitation is both a cause and
the effect of greater cohabitation.

A second explanation focuses on the economic changes. The growth of industry and the
modernization of many cultures has improved women’s social status, leading to greater gender
287

equality and sexual freedom, with marriage no longer being the only long-term relationship
option (Bumpass, 1990). A final explanation suggests that the change in employment
requirements, with many jobs now requiring more advanced education, has led to a competition
between marriage and pursuing post-secondary education (Yu & Xie, 2015). This might account
for the increase in the age of first marriage in many nations. Taken together, the greater
acceptance of premarital sex, and the economic and educational changes would lead to a
transition in relationships. Overall, cohabitation may become a step in the courtship process or
may, for some, replace marriage altogether.
Similar increases in cohabitation have also occurred in other industrialized countries. For
example, rates are high in Great Britain, Australia, Sweden, Denmark, and Finland. In fact, more
children in Sweden are born to cohabiting couples than to married couples. The lowest rates of
cohabitation in industrialized countries are in Ireland, Italy, and Japan (Benokraitis, 2005).
Cohabitation in Non-Western Cultures, The Philippines and China: Similar to other nations,
young people in the Philippines are more likely to delay marriage, to cohabitate, and to engage in
premarital sex as compared to previous generations (Williams, Kabamalan, & Ogena, 2007).
Despite these changes, many young people are still not in favor of these practices. Moreover,
there is still a persistence of traditional gender norms as there are stark differences in the
acceptance of sexual behavior out of wedlock for men and women in Philippine society. Young
men are given greater freedom. In China, young adults are cohabitating in higher numbers than
in the past (Yu & Xie, 2015). Unlike many Western cultures, in China adults with higher, rather
than lower, levels of education are more likely to cohabitate. Yu and Xie suggest this may be
due to seeing cohabitation as being a more “innovative” behavior and that those who are more
highly educated may have had more exposure to Western culture.
Marriage Worldwide: Cohen (2013) reviewed data assessing most of the world’s countries and
found that marriage has declined universally during the last several decades. This decline has
occurred in both poor and rich countries, however, the countries with the biggest drops in
marriage were mostly rich: France, Italy, Germany, Japan and the U.S. Cohen states that the
decline is not only due to individuals delaying marriage, but also because of high rates of nonmarital cohabitation. Delayed or reduced marriage is associated with higher income and lower
fertility rates that are reflected worldwide.
Marriage in the United States: In 1960, 72% of adults age 18 or older were married, in 2010
this had dropped to barely half (Wang & Taylor, 2011). At the same time, the age of first
marriage has been increasing for both men and women. In 1960, the average age for first
marriage was 20 for women and 23 for men. By 2010 this had increased to 26.5 for women and
nearly 29 for men (see Figure 7.30). Many of the explanations for increases in singlehood and
cohabitation previously given can also account for the drop and delay in marriage.

Same-Sex Marriage: In June 26, 2015, the United
States Supreme Court ruled that the Constitution
guarantees same-sex marriage. The decision indicated
that limiting marriage to only heterosexual couples
violated the 14th amendment’s guarantee of equal
protection under the law. This ruling occurred 11 years
after same-sex marriage was first made legal in
Massachusetts, and at the time of the high court
decision, 36 states and the District of Columbia had
legalized same sex marriage. Worldwide, 29 countries
currently have national laws allowing gays and lesbians

to marry (Pew Research Center, 2019). As can be seen
in Table 7.8, these countries are located mostly in Europe and the Americas.

Cultural Influences on Marriage: Many cultures have both explicit and unstated rules that
specify who is an appropriate mate. Consequently, mate selection is not completely left to the
individual. Rules of endogamy indicate the groups we should marry within and those we should
not marry in (Witt, 2009). For example, many cultures specify that people marry within their
own race, social class, age group, or religion. Endogamy reinforces the cohesiveness of the
group. Additionally, these rules encourage homogamy or marriage between people who share
social characteristics. The majority of marriages in the U. S. are homogamous with respect to
race, social class, age and to a lesser extent, religion. Homogamy is also seen in couples with
similar personalities and interests.
Arranged Marriages and Elopement: Historically, marriage was not a personal choice, but one
made by one’s family. Arranged marriages often ensured proper transference of a family’s
wealth and the support of ethnic and religious customs. Such marriages were a marriage of
families rather than of individuals. In Western Europe, starting in the 18th century the notion of
personal choice in a marital partner slowly became the norm. Arranged marriages were seen as
“traditional” and marriages based on love “modern”. Many of these early “love” marriages were
obtained by eloping (Thornton, 2005).
Around the world, more and more young couples are choosing their partners, even in nations
where arranged marriages are still the norm, such as India and Pakistan. Desai and Andrist
(2010) found that only 5% of the women they surveyed, aged 25-49, had a primary role in
choosing their partner. Only 22% knew their partner for more than one month before they were
married. However, the younger cohort of women was more likely to have been consulted by their
families before their partner was chosen than were the older cohort, suggesting that family views
are changing about personal choice. Allendorf (2013) reports that this 5% figure may also
underestimate young people’s choice, as only women were surveyed. Many families in India are
increasingly allowing sons veto power over the parents’ choice of his future spouse, and some
families give daughters the same say.
Marital Arrangements in India: As the number of arranged marriages in India is declining,
elopement is increasing. Allendorf’s (2013) study of a rural village in India, describes the
elopement process. In many cases the female leaves her family home and goes to the male’s
home, where she stays with him and his parents. After a few days, a member of his family will
inform her family of her whereabouts and gain consent for the marriage. In other cases, where
the couple anticipate some degree of opposition to the union, the couple may run away without
the knowledge of either family, often going to a relative of the male. After a few days, the couple
comes back to the home of his parents, where at that point consent is sought from both families.
Although, in some cases families may sever all ties with their child or encourage him or her to
abandon the relationship, typically, they agree to the union as the couple have spent time
together overnight. Once consent has been given, the couple lives with his family and are
considered married. A more formal ceremony takes place a few weeks or months later.
Arranged marriages are less common in the more urban regions of India than they are outside of
the cities. In rural regions, often the family farm is the young person’s only means of
employment. Thus, going against family choices may carry bigger consequences. Young people
who live in urban centers have more employment options. As a result, they are often less
economically dependent on their families, and may feel freer to make their own choices.
Thornton (2005) suggests these changes are also being driven by mass media, international
290

travel, and general Westernization of ideas. Besides India, China, Nepal, and several nations in
Southeast Asia have seen a decline in the number of arranged marriages, and an increase in
elopement or couples choosing their own partners with their families’ blessings (Allendorf,
2013).
Predictors of Marital Harmony: Advice on how to improve one’s marriage is centuries
old. One of today’s experts on marital communication is John Gottman. Gottman (1999) differs
from many marriage counselors in his belief that having a good marriage does not depend on
compatibility. Rather, the way that partners communicate to one another is crucial. At the
University of Washington in Seattle, Gottman has measured the physiological responses of
thousands of couples as they discuss issues of disagreement. Fidgeting in one’s chair, leaning
closer to or further away from the partner while speaking, and increases in respiration and heart
rate are all recorded and analyzed along with videotaped recordings of the partners’
exchanges. Gottman believes he can accurately predict whether or not a couple will stay together
by analyzing their communication. In marriages destined to fail, partners engage in the “marriage
killers”: Contempt, criticism, defensiveness, and stonewalling. Each of these undermines the
politeness and respect that healthy marriages require. Stonewalling, or shutting someone out, is
the strongest sign that a relationship is destined to fail.
Gottman, Carrere, Buehlman, Coan, and Ruckstuhl (2000) researched the perceptions newlyweds
had about their partner and marriage. The Oral History Interview used in the study, which looks
at eight variables in marriage including: Fondness/affection, we-ness, expansiveness/
expressiveness, negativity, disappointment, and three aspects of conflict resolution (chaos,
volatility, glorifying the struggle), was able to predict the stability of the marriage with 87%
accuracy at the four to six year-point and 81% accuracy at the seven to nine year-point. Gottman
(1999) developed workshops for couples to strengthen their marriages based on the results of the
Oral History Interview. Interventions include increasing the positive regard for each other,
strengthening their friendship, and improving communication and conflict resolution patterns.
Accumulated Positive Deposits: When there is a positive balance of relationship deposits this
can help the overall relationship in times of conflict. For instance, some research indicates that a
husband’s level of enthusiasm in everyday marital interactions was related to a wife’s affection
in the midst of conflict (Driver & Gottman, 2004), showing that being pleasant and making
deposits can change the nature of conflict. Also, Gottman and Levenson (1992) found that
couples rated as having more pleasant interactions, compared with couples with less pleasant
interactions, reported marital problems as less severe, higher marital satisfaction, better physical
health, and less risk for divorce. Finally, Janicki, Kamarck, Shiffman, and Gwaltney (2006)
showed that the intensity of conflict with a spouse predicted marital satisfaction, unless there was
a record of positive partner interactions, in which case the conflict did not matter as much.
Again, it seems as though having a positive balance through prior positive deposits helps to keep
relationships strong even in the midst of conflict.

Intimate Partner Abuse
Violence in romantic relationships is a significant concern for women in early adulthood as
females aged 18 to 34 generally experience the highest rates of intimate partner violence.
291

According to the most recent Violence Policy Center (2018) study, more than 1,800 women were
murdered by men in 2016. The study found that nationwide, 93% of women killed by men were
murdered by someone they knew, and guns were the most common weapon used. The national
rate of women murdered by men in single victim/single offender incidents dropped 24%, from
1.57 per 100,000 in 1996 to 1.20 per 100,000 in 2016. However, since reaching a low of 1.08 per
100,000 women in 2014, the 2016 rate increased 11%.
Intimate partner violence is often divided into situational couple violence, which is the violence
that results when heated conflict escalates, and intimate terrorism, in which one partner
consistently uses fear and violence to dominate the other (Bosson, et al., 2019). Men and women
equally use and experience situational couple violence, while men are more likely to use intimate
terrorism than are women. Consistent with this, a national survey described below, found that
female victims of intimate partner violence experience different patterns of violence, such as
rape, severe physical violence, and stalking than male victims, who most often experienced more
slapping, shoving, and pushing.
The last National Intimate Partner and Sexual
Violence Survey (NISVS) was conducted in 2015
(Smith et al., 2018). The NISVS examines the
prevalence of intimate partner violence, sexual
violence, and stalking among women and men in the
United States over the respondent's lifetime and
during the 12 months before the interview. A total
of 5,758 women and 4,323 men completed the
survey. Based on the results, women are
disproportionately affected by intimate partner
violence, sexual violence, and stalking. Results
included:

Nearly 1 in 3 women and 1 in 6 men experienced some form of contact sexual violence
during their lifetime.
Nearly 1 in 5 women and 1 in 39 men have been raped in their lifetime.
Approximately 1 in 6 women and 1 in 10 men experienced sexual coercion (e.g., sexual
pressure from someone in authority, or being worn down by requests for sex).
Almost 1 in 5 women have been the victim of severe physical violence by an intimate
partner, while 1 in 7 men have experienced the same.
1 in 6 women have been stalked during their lifetime, compared to 1 in 19 men.
More than 1 in 4 women and more than 1 in 10 men have experienced contact sexual
violence, physical violence, or stalking by an intimate partner and reported significant
short- or long-term impacts, such as post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms and injury.
An estimated 1 in 3 women experienced at least one act of psychological aggression by
an intimate partner during their lifetime.
Men and women who experienced these forms of violence were more likely to report
frequent headaches, chronic pain, difficulty with sleeping, activity limitations, poor
physical health, and poor mental health than men and women who did not experience
these forms of violence.

Parenthood
Parenthood is undergoing changes in the United States and elsewhere in the world. Children are
less likely to be living with both parents, and women in the United States have fewer children
than they did previously. The average fertility rate of women in the United States was about
seven children in the early 1900s and has remained relatively stable at 2.1 since the 1970s
(Hamilton, Martin, & Ventura, 2011; Martinez, Daniels, & Chandra, 2012). Not only are parents
having fewer children, the context of parenthood has also changed. Parenting outside of marriage
has increased dramatically among most socioeconomic, racial, and ethnic groups, although
college-educated women are substantially more likely to be married at the birth of a child than
are mothers with less education (Dye, 2010).
People are having children at older ages, too. This is not
surprising given that many of the age markers for adulthood
have been delayed, including marriage, completing education,
establishing oneself at work, and gaining financial
independence. In 2014 the average age for American first-time
mothers was 26.3 years (CDC, 2015a). The birth rate for
women in their early 20s has declined in recent years, while
the birth rate for women in their late 30s has risen. In 2011,
40% of births were to women ages 30 and older. For Canadian
women, birth rates are even higher for women in their late 30s
than in their early 20s. In 2011, 52% of births were to women
ages 30 and older, and the average first-time Canadian mother
was 28.5 years old (Cohn, 2013). Improved birth control
methods have also enabled women to postpone motherhood.
Despite the fact that young people are more often delaying
Source
childbearing, most 18- to 29-year-olds want to have children
and say that being a good parent is one of the most important things in life (Wang & Taylor,
2011).
Figure 7.33

Influences on Parenting: Parenting is a complex process in which parents and children
influence on another. There are many reasons that parents behave the way they do. The multiple
influences on parenting are still being explored. Proposed influences on parenting include:
Parent characteristics, child characteristics, and contextual can sociocultural characteristics.
(Belsky, 1984; Demick, 1999).
Parent Characteristics: Parents bring unique traits and qualities to the parenting relationship
that affect their decisions as parents. These characteristics include the age of the parent, gender,
beliefs, personality, developmental history, knowledge about parenting and child development,
and mental and physical health. Parents’ personalities affect parenting behaviors. Mothers and
fathers who are more agreeable, conscientious, and outgoing are warmer and provide more
structure to their children. Parents who are more agreeable, less anxious, and less negative also
support their children’s autonomy more than parents who are anxious and less agreeable (Prinzie,
Stams, Dekovic, Reijntes, & Belsky, 2009). Parents who have these personality traits appear to
be better able to respond to their children positively and provide a more consistent, structured
environment for their children.
293

Parents’ developmental histories, or their
experiences as children, also affect their
parenting strategies. Parents may learn parenting
practices from their own parents. Fathers whose
own parents provided monitoring, consistent and
age-appropriate discipline, and warmth were
more likely to provide this constructive
parenting to their own children (Kerr, Capaldi,
Pears, & Owen, 2009). Patterns of negative
parenting and ineffective discipline also appear
from one generation to the next. However,
parents who are dissatisfied with their own
parents’ approach may be more likely to change
their parenting methods with their own children.

Figure 7.34

Child Characteristics: Parenting is bidirectional. Not only do parents affect their children,
children influence their parents. Child characteristics, such as gender, birth order, temperament,
and health status, affect parenting behaviors and roles. For example, an infant with an easy
temperament may enable parents to feel more effective, as they are easily able to soothe the child
and elicit smiling and cooing. On the other hand, a cranky or fussy infant elicits fewer positive
reactions from his or her parents and may result in parents feeling less effective in the parenting
role (Eisenberg et al., 2008). Over time, parents of more difficult children may become more
punitive and less patient with their children (Clark, Kochanska, & Ready, 2000; Eisenberg et al.,
1999; Kiff, Lengua, & Zalewski, 2011). Parents who have a fussy, difficult child are less
satisfied with their marriages and have greater challenges in balancing work and family roles
(Hyde, Else-Quest, & Goldsmith, 2004). Thus, child temperament, as previously discussed in
chapter 3, is one of the child characteristics that influences how parents behave with their
children.
Another child characteristic is the gender of the child. Parents respond differently to boys and
girls. Parents often assign different household chores to their sons and daughters. Girls are more
often responsible for caring for younger siblings and household chores, whereas boys are more
likely to be asked to perform chores outside the home, such as mowing the lawn (Grusec,
goodnow, & Cohen, 1996). Parents also talk differently with their sons and daughters, providing
more scientific explanations to their sons and using more emotion words with their daughters
(Crowley, Callanan, Tenenbaum, & Allen, 2001).
Contextual Factors and Sociocultural Characteristics: The parent–child relationship does not
occur in isolation. Sociocultural characteristics, including economic hardship, religion, politics,
neighborhoods, schools, and social support, also influence parenting. Parents who experience
economic hardship are more easily frustrated, depressed, and sad, and these emotional
characteristics affect their parenting skills (Conger & Conger, 2002). Culture also influences
parenting behaviors in fundamental ways. Although promoting the development of skills
necessary to function effectively in one’s community is a universal goal of parenting, the specific
skills necessary vary widely from culture to culture. Thus, parents have different goals for their
294

children that partially depend on their culture (Tamis-LeMonda et al., 2008). Parents vary in
how much they emphasize goals for independence and individual achievements, maintaining
harmonious relationships, and being embedded in a strong network of social relationships. Other
important contextual characteristics, such as the neighborhood, school, and social networks, also
affect parenting, even though these settings do not always include both the child and the parent
(Brofenbrenner, 1989). Culture is also a contributing contextual factor, as discussed previously
in chapter four. For example, Latina mothers who perceived their neighborhood as more
dangerous showed less warmth with their children, perhaps because of the greater stress
associated with living a threatening environment (Gonzales et al., 2011). The different influences
are shown in Figure 7.35.

Chapter 8: Middle Adulthood
Middle adulthood, or midlife, refers to the period of the lifespan between early adulthood and
late adulthood. Although ages and tasks are culturally defined, the most common age definition
is from 40-45 to 60-65. This may be the least studied time of the lifespan, and research on this
developmental period is relatively new as many aspects of midlife are still being explored. In the
United States, the large Baby Boom cohort (those born between 1946 and 1964) are now midlife
adults (and some even late adults) and this has led to increased interest in this developmental
stage. We do know that this stage reflects both developmental gains and losses and that there are
considerable individual differences, but there is still much to learn about this age group.

Each person experiences age-related physical changes based on many factors: biological factors,
such as molecular and cellular changes, and oxidative damage are called primary aging, while
aging that occurs due to controllable factors, such as an unhealthy lifestyle including lack of
physical exercise and poor diet, is called secondary aging (Busse, 1969). These factors are
shown in Figure 8.1
Getting out of shape is not an
inevitable part of aging; it is
probably due to the fact that middleaged adults become less physically
active and have experienced greater
stress. Smoking tobacco, drinking
alcohol, poor diet, stress, physical
inactivity, and chronic disease, such
as diabetes or arthritis, reduce
overall health. However, there are
things can be done to combat many
of these changes by adopting
healthier lifestyles.

Physical Changes
Hair: When asked to imagine someone in middle adulthood, we often picture someone with the
beginnings of wrinkles and gray or thinning hair. What accounts for these physical changes?
Hair color is due to a pigment called melanin which is produced by hair follicles (Martin, 2014).
With aging, the hair follicles produce less melanin, and this causes the hair to become gray. Hair
color typically starts turning lighter at the temples, but eventually all the hair will become white.
For many, graying begins in the 30s, but it is largely determined by your genes. Gray hair occurs
earlier in white people and later in Asians.
Genes also determine how much hair remains on
Figure 8.2 Andre Agassi
your head. Almost everyone has some hair loss with
aging, and the rate of hair growth slows with aging.
Many hair follicles stop producing new hairs and
hair strands become smaller. Men begin showing
signs of balding by 30 and some are nearly bald by
60. Male-pattern baldness is related to testosterone
and is identified by a receding hairline followed by
hair loss at the top of the head. Figure 8.2 shows
tennis champion Andre Agassi’s characteristic malepatterned baldness. Women can also develop femalepatterned baldness as their hair becomes less dense
and the scalp becomes visible (Martin, 2014).
Sudden hair loss, however, can be a symptom of a
health problem.

Skin: Skin continues to dry out and is prone to more wrinkling, particularly on the sensitive face
area. Wrinkles, or creases in the skin, are a normal part of aging. As we get older, our skin dries
and loses the underlying layer of fat, so our face no longer appears smooth. Loss of muscle tone
and thinning skin can make the face appear flabby or drooping. Although wrinkles are a natural
part of aging and genetics plays a role, frequent sun exposure and smoking will cause wrinkles to
appear sooner. Dark spots and blotchy skin also occur as one ages and are due to exposure to
sunlight (Moskowitz, 2014). Blood vessels become more apparent as the skin continues to dry
and get thinner.
Sarcopenia: The loss of muscle mass and strength that occurs with aging is referred to as
sarcopenia (Morley, Baumgartner, Roubenoff, Mayer, & Nair, 2001). Sarcopenia is thought to
be a significant factor in the frailty and functional impairment that occurs when older. The
decline of growth and anabolic hormones, especially testosterone, and decreased physical
activity have been implicated as causes of sarcopenia (Proctor, Balagopal, & Nair, 1998). This
decline in muscle mass can occur as early as 40 years of age and contributes significantly to a
decrease in life quality, increase in health care costs, and early death in older adults (Karakelides
& Nair, 2005). Exercise is certainly important to increase strength, aerobic capacity, and muscle
protein synthesis, but unfortunately it does not reverse all the age-related changes that occur. The
308

muscle-to-fat ratio for both men and women also changes throughout middle adulthood, with an
accumulation of fat in the stomach area.
Lungs: The lungs serve two functions: Supply oxygen and remove carbon dioxide. Thinning of
the bones with age can change the shape of the rib cage and result in a loss of lung expansion.
Age related changes in muscles, such as the weakening of the diaphragm, can also reduce lung
capacity. Both of these changes will lower oxygen levels in the blood and increase the levels of
carbon dioxide. Experiencing shortness of breath and feeling tired can result (NIH, 2014b). In
middle adulthood, these changes and their effects are often minimal, especially in people who are
non-smokers and physically active. However, in those with chronic bronchitis, or who have
experienced frequent pneumonia, asthma other lung related disorders, or who are smokers, the
effects of these normal age changes can be more pronounced.

Sensory Changes
Vision: A normal change of the eye due
to age is presbyopia, which is Latin for
“old vision.” It refers to a loss of
elasticity in the lens of the eye that
makes it harder for the eye to focus on
objects that are closer to the person.
When we look at something far away,
the lens flattens out; when looking at
nearby objects tiny muscle fibers around
the lens enable the eye to bend the lens.
With age these muscles weaken and can
no longer accommodate the lens to focus
the light. Anyone over the age of 35 is
at risk for developing presbyopia.
According to the National Eye Institute
(NEI) (2016), signs that someone may
have presbyopia include:
•

Another common eye problem people experience as they age are floaters, little spots or
“cobwebs” that float around the field of vision. They are most noticeable if you are looking at
the sky on a sunny day, or at a lighted blank screen. Floaters occur when the vitreous, a gel-like
substance in the interior of the eye, slowly shrinks. As it shrinks, it becomes somewhat stringy,
and these strands can cast tiny shadows on the retina. In most cases, floaters are harmless, more
of an annoyance than a sign of eye problems. However, floaters that appear suddenly, or that
darken and obscure vision can be a sign of more serious eye problems, such a retinal tearing,
309

infection, or inflammation. People who are very nearsighted (myopic), have diabetes, or who
have had cataract surgery are also more likely to have floaters (NEI, 2009).
During midlife, adults may begin to notice a drop in scotopic sensitivity, the ability to see in
dimmer light. By age 60, the retina receives only one third as much light as it did at age 20,
making working in dimmer light more difficult (Jackson & Owsley, 2000). Night vision is also
affected as the pupil loses some of its ability to open and close to accommodate drastic changes
in light. Eyes become more sensitive to glare from headlights and street lights making it difficult
to see people and cars, and movements outside of our direct line of sight (NIH, 2016c).
Finally, some people experience dry eye syndrome, which occurs when the eye does not
produce tears properly, or when the tears evaporate too quickly because they are not the correct
consistency (NEI, 2013). While dry eye can affect people at any age, nearly 5 million Americans
over the age of 50 experience dry eye. It affects women more than men, especially after
menopause. Women who experienced an early menopause may be more likely to experience dry
eye, which can cause surface damage to the eye.

younger adults (Füllgrabe, Moore, & Stone,
2015; Neidleman, Wambacq, Besing,
Spitzer, & Koehnke, 2015). As we age we also lose the ability to hear higher frequencies
(Humes, Kewley-Port, Fogerty, & Kinney, 2010). Hearing changes are more common among
men than women, but males may underestimate their hearing problems (Uchida, Nakashima,
Ando, Niino, & Shimokata, 2003). For many adults, hearing loss accumulates after years of
being exposed to intense noise levels. Men are more likely to work in noisy occupations. Hearing
loss is also exacerbated by cigarette smoking, high blood pressure, diabetes, and stroke. Most
hearing loss could be prevented by guarding against being exposed to extremely noisy
environments.

Health Concerns
Heart Disease: According to the most recent National Vital Statistics Reports (Kochanek,
Murphy, Xu, & Arias, 2019) heart disease continues to be the number one cause of death for
Americans as it claimed 23% of those who died in 2017. It is also the number one cause of death
worldwide (World Health Organization, 2018). Heart disease develops slowly over time and
typically appears in midlife (Hooker & Pressman, 2016).
Heart disease can include heart defects and heart rhythm problems, as well as narrowed, blocked,
or stiffened blood vessels referred to as cardiovascular disease. The blocked blood vessels
prevent the body and heart from receiving adequate blood. Atherosclerosis, or a buildup of fatty
plaque in the arteries, is the most common cause of cardiovascular disease. The plaque buildup
thickens the artery walls and restricts the blood flow to organs and tissues. Cardiovascular
disease can lead to a heart attack, chest pain (angina), or stroke (Mayo Clinic, 2014a). Figure 8.5
illustrates atherosclerosis.
Symptoms of cardiovascular
disease differ for men and
women. Males are more likely
to suffer chest pain, while
women are more likely to
demonstrate shortness of
breath, nausea, and extreme
fatigue. Symptoms can also
include pain in the arms, legs,
neck, jaw, throat, abdomen or
back (Mayo Clinic, 2014a).

Figure 8.5 Atherosclerosis

According to the Mayo Clinic
(2014a) there are many risk
factors for developing heart
disease, including medical
conditions, such as high blood
pressure, high cholesterol,
diabetes, and obesity. Other
risk factors include:

disease before age 55 or female parent or sister developed heart disease before age 65.
Smoking-nicotine constricts blood vessels and carbon monoxide damages the inner
lining.
Poor Diet-a diet high in fat, salt, sugar, and cholesterol.
311

•
•
•

Excessive Alcohol Consumption-alcohol can raise the level of bad fats in the blood and
increase blood pressure
Stress-unrelieved stress can damage arteries and worsen other risk factors.
Poor Hygiene-establishing good hygiene habits can prevent viral or bacterial infections
that can affect the heart. Poor dental care can also contribute to heart disease.

Complications of heart disease can include heart failure, when the heart cannot pump enough
blood to the meet the body’s needs, and a heart attack, such as when a blood clot blocks the
blood flow to the heart. This blockage can damage or destroy a part of the heart muscle, and
atherosclerosis is a factor in a heart attack. Treatment for heart disease includes medication,
surgery, and lifestyle changes including exercise, healthy diet, and refraining from smoking.
Sudden cardiac arrest is the unexpected loss of heart functioning, breathing, and consciousness,
often caused by an arrhythmia or abnormal heartbeat. The heart beat may be too quick, too slow,
or irregular. With a healthy heart, it is unlikely for a fatal arrhythmia to develop without an
outside factor, such as an electric shock or illegal drugs. If not treated immediately, sudden
cardiac arrest can be fatal and result in sudden cardiac death.
Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is a serious health problem that occurs when the blood
flows with a greater force than normal. One in three American adults (70 million people) have
hypertension and only half have it under control (Nwankwo, Yoon, Burt, & Gu, 2013). It can
strain the heart, increase the risk of heart attack and stroke, or damage the kidneys (CDC, 2014a).
Uncontrolled high blood pressure in early and middle adulthood can also damage the brain’s
white matter (axons) and may be linked to cognitive problems later in life (Maillard et al., 2012).
Normal blood pressure is under 120/80 (see Table 8.1). The first number is the systolic
pressure, which is the pressure in the blood vessels when the heart beats. The second number is
the diastolic pressure, which is the pressure in the blood vessels when the heart is at rest. High
blood pressure is sometimes referred to as the silent killer, as most people with hypertension
experience no symptoms. Making positive lifestyle changes can often reduce blood pressure.

Cancer: After heart disease, cancer was the second leading cause of death for Americans in
2017 as it accounted for 21.3% of all deaths (Kochanek et al., 2016). According to the National
Institutes of Health (2015), cancer is the name given to a collection of related diseases in which
the body’s cells begin to divide without stopping and spread into surrounding tissues. These
extra cells can divide, and form growths called tumors, which are typically masses of tissue.
Cancerous tumors are malignant, which means they can invade nearby tissues. When removed
malignant tumors may grow back. Unlike malignant tumors, benign tumors do not invade nearby
tissues. Benign tumors can sometimes be quite large, and when removed usually do not grow
back. Although benign tumors in the body are not cancerous, benign brain tumors can be life
threatening.
Cancer cells can prompt nearby normal cells to form blood vessels that supply the tumors with
oxygen and nutrients, which allows them to grow. These blood vessels also remove waste
products from the tumors. Cancer cells can also hide from the immune system, a network of
organs, tissues, and specialized cells that protects the body from infections and other conditions.
Lastly, cancer cells can metastasize, which means they can break from where they first formed,
called the primary cancer, and travel through the lymph system or blood to form new tumors in
other parts of the body. This new metastatic tumor is the same type as the primary tumor
(National Institutes of Health, 2015). Figure 8.6 illustrates how cancers can metastasize.
Cancer can start almost anywhere
in the human body. While normal
cells mature into very distinct cell
types with specific functions,
cancer cells do not and continue to
divide without stopping. Further,
cancer cells are able to ignore the
signals that normally tell cells to
stop dividing or to begin a process
known as programmed cell death
which the body uses to get rid of
unneeded cells. With the growth
of cancer cells, normal cells are
crowded out and the body is
unable to work the way it is
supposed to. For example, the
cancer cells in lung cancer form
tumors which interfere with the
functioning of the lungs and how
oxygen is transported to the rest of
the body.

There are more than 100 types of cancer. The American Cancer Society assemblies a list of the
most common types of cancers in the United States. To qualify for the 2016 list, the estimated
annual incidence had to be 40, 000 cases or more. The most common type of cancer on the list is
breast cancer, with more than 249,000 new cases expected in 2016. The next most common

Cholesterol is a waxy fatty substance carried by lipoprotein molecules in the blood. It is created
by the body to create hormones and digest fatty foods and is also found in many foods. Your
body needs cholesterol, but too much can cause heart disease and stroke. Two important kinds
of cholesterol are low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). A third
type of fat is called triglycerides. Your total cholesterol score is based on all three types of lipids
(see Table 8.3). Total cholesterol is calculated by adding HDL plus LDL plus 20% of the
Triglycerides.

stroke. Triglycerides are a type of fat in
the blood used for energy. High levels of triglycerides can also increase your risk for heart
disease and stroke when coupled with high LDL and low HDL. All adults 20 or older should
have their cholesterol checked. In early adulthood, doctors may check every few years if the
numbers have previously been normal, and there are no other signs of heart disease. In middle
adulthood, this may become part of the annual check-up (CDC, 2015).
Table 8.3 Normal Levels of Cholesterol

Risk factors for high cholesterol include: A family history for high cholesterol, diabetes, a diet
high in saturated fats, trans fat, and cholesterol, physical inactivity, and obesity. Almost 32% of
American adults have high LDL cholesterol levels, and the majority do not have it under control,
nor have they made lifestyle changes (CDC, 2015).
Diabetes (Diabetes Mellitus) is a disease in which the body does not control the amount of
glucose in the blood. This disease occurs when the body
Figure 8.7
does not make enough insulin or does not use it the way
it should (NIH, 2016a). Insulin is a type of hormone that
helps glucose in the blood enter cells to give them
energy. In adults, 90% to 95% of all diagnosed cases of
diabetes are type 2 (American Diabetes Association
(ADA), 2016). Type 2 diabetes usually begins with
insulin resistance, a disorder in which the cells in the
muscles, liver, and fat tissue do not use insulin properly
(CDC, 2014d). As the need for insulin increases, cells
Source (CDC, 2014d).
in the pancreas gradually lose the ability to produce
enough insulin. In some Type 2 diabetics, pancreatic
beta cells will cease functioning, and the need for insulin injections will become necessary.
Some people with diabetes experience insulin resistance with only minor dysfunction of the beta
cell secretion of insulin. Other diabetics experience only slight insulin resistance, with the
primary cause being a lack of insulin secretion (CDC, 2014d).
One in three adults are estimated to have prediabetes, and 9 in 10 of them do not know.
According to the CDC (2014d) without intervention, 15% to 30% of those with prediabetes will
develop diabetes within 5 years. In 2015, 30.2 million people (9.4% of the population) were
living with diabetes in America, mostly adults age 18 and up (CDC, 2017). Table 8.4 shows the
numbers in millions and percentage of adults, by age and gender, with both diagnosed and
undiagnosed diabetes. The median age of diagnosis is 54 (CDC, 2014d). During middle
adulthood, the number of people with diabetes dramatically increases; with 4.3 million living
with diabetes prior to age 45, to over 13 million between the ages of 45 to 64; a four-fold
increase. Men are slightly more likely to experience diabetes than are women.

Figure 8.8 Ethnic Differences in Diabetes Diagnosis

Diabetes also affects ethnic and racial groups differently. Non-Hispanic Whites are less likely to
be diagnosed with diabetes than are Asian Americans, Hispanics, non-Hispanic Blacks, and
American Indians/Alaskan Natives. However, these general figures hide the variations within
these groups. For instance, the rate of diabetes was less for Central, South, and Cuban
Americans than for Mexican Americans and Puerto Ricans, and less for Alaskan Natives than the
American Indians of southern Arizona (CDC, 2017). Additionally, educational attainment,
which is linked to one’s economic level, is correlated with diabetes. Percentages includes: Less
than a high shool degree (21.6%), high school degree (9.5%), and more than a high school
degree (7.2%).

more likely to have cardiovascular disease, 1.8 times more likely to experience a heart attack,
and 1.5 times more likely to experience stroke than adults without diabetes. Diabetes can cause
blindness and other eye problems. Between 40%-45% of Americans with diabetes have some
degree of diabetic retinopathy, which is damage to the small blood vessels in the retina that
may lead to loss of vision (NEI, 2015). More than 4% showed advanced diabetic retinopathy.
Diabetes is linked as the primary cause of almost half (44%) of new cases of kidney failure each
year. About 60% of non-traumatic limb amputations occur in people with diabetes. Diabetes
has been linked to hearing loss, tinnitus (ringing in the ears), gum disease, and neuropathy (nerve
disease) (CDC, 2014d).
316

Typical tests for diabetes include a fasting glucose test and the A1C (See Table 8.5). Fasting
glucose levels should be under 100mg/dl (ADA, 2016). The A1C provides information about the
average levels of blood glucose over the last 3 months (NIH, 2014a). The A1C should be under
5.7, where a 5.0 = 97mg/dl and a 6.0 = 126 mg/dl (ADA, 2016).

Metabolic Syndrome is a cluster of several cardiometabolic risk factors, including large waist
circumference, high blood pressure, and elevated triglycerides, LDL, and blood glucose levels,
which can lead to diabetes and heart disease (Crist et al., 2012). The prevalence of metabolic
syndrome in the U.S. is approximately 34% and is especially high among Hispanics and African
Americans (Ford, Li, & Zhao, 2010). Prevalence increases with age, peaking in one’s 60s (Ford
et al., 2010). Metabolic syndrome increases morbidity from cardiovascular disease and diabetes
(Hu et al., 2004; Malik, 2004). Hu and colleagues found that even having one or two of the risk
factors for metabolic syndrome increased the risk of mortality. Crist et al. (2012) found that
increasing aerobic activity and reducing weight led to a drop in many of the risk factors of
metabolic syndrome, including a reduction in waist circumference and blood pressure, and an
increase in HDL cholesterol.
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory disease that causes pain, swelling, stiffness, and
loss of function in the joints (NIH, 2016b). RA occurs when the immune system attacks the
membrane lining the joints (see Figure 8.8). RA is the second most common form of arthritis
after osteoarthritis, which is the normal wear and tear on the joints discussed in chapter 9. Unlike
osteoarthritis, RA is symmetric in its attack of the body, thus, if one shoulder is affected so is the

other. In addition, those with RA may experience fatigue and fever. Below are the common
features of RA (NIH, 2016b).

Variability of symptoms among people with the disease.

About 1.5 million people (approximately 0.6%) of Americans experience rheumatoid arthritis. It
occurs across all races and age groups, although the disease often begins in middle adulthood and
occurs with increased frequency in older people. Like some other forms of arthritis, rheumatoid
arthritis occurs much more frequently in women than in men. About two to three times as many
women as men have the disease (NIH, 2016b). The lifetime risk for RA for women is 3.6% and
1.7% for men (Crowson, et al., 2011).
Genes play a role in the development of RA. However, individual genes by themselves confer
only a small risk of developing the disease, as some people who have these particular genes
never develop RA. Scientists think that something must occur to trigger the disease process in
people whose genetic makeup makes them susceptible to rheumatoid arthritis. For instance, some
scientists also think hormonal factors may be involved. In women who experience RA, the
symptoms may improve during pregnancy and flare after pregnancy. Women who use oral
contraceptives may increase their likelihood of developing RA. This suggests hormones, or
possibly deficiencies or changes in certain hormones, may increase the risk of developing RA in
a genetically susceptible person (NIH, 2016b).
Rheumatoid arthritis can affect virtually every area of a person’s life, and it can interfere with the
joys and responsibilities of work and family life. Fortunately, current treatment strategies allow
most people with RA to lead active and productive lives. Pain-relieving drugs and medications
can slow joint damage and establishing a balance between rest and exercise can also lessen the
symptoms of RA (NIH, 2016b).
Fatty liver disease (hepatic steatosis) refers to the accumulation of fat in the liver. The liver
normally contains little fat, and anything below 5% of liver weight is considered normal. This
disease is present in 33% of American adults. In the past the main cause of fat accumulation in
the liver was due to excessive alcohol consumption, often eventually leading to cirrhosis and
liver failure. Today, increased caloric intake, especially resulting in obesity, and little physical
activity are the main causes. Mild to moderate levels of hepatic steatosis can be reversed through
healthy lifestyle changes (Nassir, Rector, Hammoud, & Ibdah, 2015).

318

Digestive Issues
Heartburn, also called acid indigestion or pyrosis, is a
common digestive problem in adults and is the result of
stomach acid backing up into the esophagus. Prolonged
contact with the digestive juices injures the lining of the
esophagus and causes discomfort. Heartburn that occurs
more frequently may be due to gastroesophageal reflux
disease or GERD. Normally the lower sphincter muscle in
the esophagus keeps the acid in the stomach from entering
the esophagus. In GERD this muscle relaxes too frequently
and the stomach acid flows into the esophagus. In the U.S.,
60 million people experience heartburn at least once a
month, and 15 million experience it every day. Prolonged
problems with heartburn can lead to more serious
complications, including esophageal cancer, one of the most
lethal forms of cancer in the U.S. Problems with heartburn
can be linked to eating fatty or spicy foods, caffeine,
smoking, and eating before bedtime (American College of
Gastroenterology, 2016a).

Gallstones are hard particles, including fatty materials, bile
pigments, and calcium deposits, that can develop in the gallbladder. Ranging in size from a grain
of sand to a golf ball, they typically take years to develop, but in some people have developed
over the course of a few months. About 75% of gallstones do not create any symptoms, but those
that do may cause sporadic upper abdominal pain when stones block bile or pancreatic ducts. If
stones become lodged in the ducts, it may necessitate surgery or other medical intervention as it
could become life-threatening if left untreated (American College of Gastroenterology, 2016b).
Gallstones are present in about 20% of women and 10% of men over the age of 55 (American
College of Gastroenterology, 2016b). Risk factors include a family history of gallstones, diets
high in calories and refined carbohydrates (such as, white bread and rice), diabetes, metabolic
syndrome, Crohn’s disease, and obesity, which increases the cholesterol in the bile and thus
increases the risk of developing gallstones (NIH, 2013).

Sleep
According to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (Kasper, 2015) adults require at least 7
hours of sleep per night to avoid the health risks associated with chronic sleep deprivation. Less
than 6 hours and more than 10 hours is also not recommended for those in middle adulthood
(National Sleep Foundation, 2015). Not surprisingly, many Americans do not receive the 7-9
hours of sleep recommended. In 2013, only 59% of U.S. adults met that standard, while in 1942,
84% did (Jones, 2013). This means 41% of Americans receive less than the recommended
amount of nightly sleep. Additional results included that in 1993, 67% of Americans felt they
were getting enough sleep, but in 2013 only 56% felt they received as much sleep as needed.
Additionally, 43% of Americans in 2013 believed they would feel better with more sleep.
319

Sleep problems: According to the Sleep in America poll (National Sleep Foundation, 2015), 9%
of Americans report being diagnosed with a sleep disorder, and of those 71% have sleep apnea
and 24% suffer from insomnia. Pain is also a contributing factor in the difference between the
amount of sleep Americans say they need and the amount they are getting. An average of 42
minutes of sleep debt occur for those with chronic pain, and 14 minutes for those who have
suffered from acute pain in the past week. Stress and overall poor health are also key
components of shorter sleep durations and worse sleep quality. Those in midlife with lower life
satisfaction experienced greater delay in the onset of sleep than those with higher life
satisfaction. Delayed onset of sleep could be the result of worry and anxiety during midlife, and
improvements in those areas should improve sleep. Lastly, menopause can affect a woman’s
sleep duration and quality (National Sleep Foundation, 2016).

Children in the home and
sleep: As expected, having
children at home affects the
amount of sleep one receives.
According to a 2016 National
Center for Health Statistics
analysis (CDC, 2016) having
children decreases the amount
of sleep an individual receives,
however, having a partner can
improve the amount of sleep
for both males and females.
Table 8.6 illustrates the
percentage of individuals not
receiving seven hours of sleep
per night based on parental
role.

Negative consequences of insufficient sleep:
Figure 8.11 The Importance of Sleep
There are many consequences of too little sleep,
and they include physical, cognitive, and
emotional changes. Sleep deprivation suppresses
immune responses that fight off infection, and
can lead to obesity, memory impairment, and
hypertension (Ferrie et al., 2007; Kushida,
2005). Insufficient sleep is linked to an
increased risk for colon cancer, breast cancer,
heart disease and type 2 diabetes (Pattison,
2015). A lack of sleep can increase stress as
cortisol (a stress hormone) remains elevated
Source
which keeps the body in a state of alertness and
hyperarousal which increases blood pressure.
Sleep is also associated with longevity. Dew et al. (2003) found that older adults who had better
sleep patterns also lived longer. During deep sleep a growth hormone is released which
stimulates protein synthesis, breaks down fat that supplies energy, and stimulates cell division.
320

Consequently, a decrease in deep sleep contributes to less growth hormone being released and
subsequent physical decline seen in aging (Pattison, 2015).
Sleep disturbances can also impair glucose functioning in middle adulthood. Caucasian, African
American, and Chinese non-shift-working women aged 48–58 years who were not taking
insulin-related medications, participated in the Study of Women's Health across the Nation
(SWAN) Sleep Study and were subsequently examined approximately 5 years later (Taylor et
al., 2016). Body mass index (BMI) and insulin resistance were measured at two time points.
Results indicated that irregular sleep schedules, including highly variable bedtimes and staying
up much later than usual, are associated in midlife women with insulin resistance, which is an
important indicator of metabolic health, including diabetes risk. Diabetes risk increases in
midlife women, and irregular sleep schedules may be an important reason because irregular
bedtime schedules expose the body to varying levels of light, which is the most important timing
cue for the body’s circadian clock. By disrupting circadian timing, bedtime variability may
impair glucose metabolism and energy homeostasis.

Exercise, Nutrition, and Weight
The impact of exercise: Exercise is a powerful way to combat the changes we associate with
aging. Exercise builds muscle, increases metabolism, helps control blood sugar, increases bone
density, and relieves stress. Unfortunately, fewer than half of midlife adults exercise and only
about 20 percent exercise frequently and strenuously enough to achieve health benefits. Many
stop exercising soon after they begin an exercise program, particularly those who are very
overweight. The best exercise programs are those that are engaged in regularly, regardless of the
activity. A well-rounded program that is easy to follow includes walking and weight
training. Having a safe, enjoyable place to walk can make the difference in whether or not
someone walks regularly. Weight lifting and stretching exercises at home can also be part of an
effective program. Exercise is particularly helpful in reducing stress in midlife. Walking,
jogging, cycling, or swimming can release the tension caused by stressors. Learning relaxation
techniques can also have healthful benefits. Exercise can be thought of as preventative health
care. Promoting exercise for the 78 million "baby boomers" may be one of the best ways to
reduce health care costs and improve quality of life (Shure & Cahan, 1998).
According to the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (2008), the following are
exercise guidelines for adults:
•
•

•
•

Adults should avoid being inactive. Any activity will result in some health benefits.
For substantial health benefits, adults should engage in at least 150 minutes per week of
moderate intensity exercise OR at least 75 minutes of vigorous intensity aerobic activity.
Aerobic activity should occur for at least 10 minutes and preferably spread throughout
the week.
For more extensive health benefits, adults can increase their aerobic activity to 300
minutes per week of moderate intensity OR 150 minutes per week of vigorous intensity
aerobic activity.
Adults should also participate in muscle-strengthening activities that are moderate or
high intensity and involve all major muscle groups on two or more days per week.
321

Nutritional concerns: Aging brings about a reduction in the number of calories a person
requires (see Table 8.7 for estimated caloric needs in middle-aged adults). Many Americans
respond to weight gain by dieting. However, eating less does not typically mean eating right and
people often suffer vitamin and mineral deficiencies as a result. All adults need to be especially
cognizant of the amount of sodium, sugar, and fat they are ingesting.

Excess Sodium: According to dietary guidelines, adults should consume less than 2,300mg (1
teaspoon) per day of sodium. The American Heart Association (2016) reports that the average
sodium intake among Americans is 3440mg per day. Processed foods are the main culprits of
excess sodium. High sodium levels in the diet is correlated with increased blood pressure, and its
reduction does show corresponding drops in blood pressure. Adults with high blood pressure are
strongly encouraged to reduce their sodium intake to 1500mg (U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services & U.S. Department of Agriculture (USHHS & USDA), 2015).
Excess Fat: Dietary guidelines also suggests that adults should consume less than 10 percent of
calories per day from saturated fats. The American Heart Association (2016) says optimally we
should aim for a dietary pattern that achieves 5% to 6% of calories from saturated fat. In a 2000
calorie diet that is about 120 calories from saturated fat. In the average American diet about
34.3% of the diet comes from fat, with 15.0% from saturated fat (Berglund et al., 1999). Diets
high in fat not only contribute to weight gain, but have been linked to heart disease, stroke, and
high cholesterol.
Added Sugar: According to the recent Dietary Guidelines for Americans (USHHS & USDA,
2015) eating healthy means adults should consume less than 10 percent of calories per day from
added sugars. Yet, currently about 15% of the calories in the American adult diet come from
added sugars, or about 22 teaspoons of sugar per day (NIH, 2014c). Excess sugar not only
contributes to weight gain, but diabetes and other health problems.
322

Metabolism and Weight Gain: One of the common complaints of midlife adults is weight gain,
especially the accumulation of fat in the abdomen, which is often referred to as the middle-aged
spread (Lachman, 2004). Men tend to gain fat on their upper abdomen and back, while women
tend to gain more fat on their
waist and upper arms. Many
Figure 8.12 Exercise is Very Important in Middle Age
adults are surprised at this
weight gain because their
diets have not changed,
however, their metabolism
has slowed during midlife.
Metabolism is the process by
which the body converts food
and drink into energy. The
calories consumed are
combined with oxygen to
release the energy needed to
function (Mayo Clinic,
2014b). People who have
more muscle burn more
calories, even at rest, and thus
Source
have a higher metabolism.

However, as you get older, the amount of muscle decreases. Consequently, fat accounts for
more of one’s weight in midlife. and fat slows down the number of calories burned. To
compensate, midlife adults have to increase their level of exercise, eat less, and watch their
nutrition to maintain their earlier physique.
Obesity: As discussed in the early adulthood chapter, obesity is a significant health concern for
adults throughout the world, and especially America. Obesity rates continue to increase and the
current rate for those 40-59 is 42.8%, which is the highest percentage per age group (CDC,
2017). Being overweight is associated with a myriad of health conditions including diabetes,
high blood pressure, and heart disease. New research is now linking obesity to Alzheimer’s
disease. Chang et al. (2016) found that being overweight in midlife was associated with earlier
onset of Alzheimer’s disease. The study looked at 1,394 men and women who were part of the
Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. Their average age was around 60, and they were
followed for 14 years. Results indicated that people with the highest body mass index, or BMI,
at age 50 were more likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease. In fact, each one-point increase in
BMI was associated with getting Alzheimer’s six to seven months earlier. Those with the highest
BMIs also had more brain changes typical of Alzheimer’s, even if they did not have symptoms
of the disease. Scientists speculate that fat cells may produce harmful chemicals that promote
inflammation in blood vessels throughout the body, including in the brain. The conclusion of the
study was that a healthy BMI at midlife may delay the onset of Alzheimer’s disease.
Concluding Thoughts: Many of the changes that occur in midlife can be easily compensated
for, such as buying glasses, exercising, and watching what one eats. However, the percentage of
323

middle adults who have a significant health concern has increased in the past 15 years.
According to the 2016 United Health Foundation’s America’s Health Rankings Senior Report,
the next generation of seniors will be less healthy than the current seniors (United Health
Foundation, 2016). The study compared the health of middle-aged Americans (50-64 years of
age) in 2014 to middle-aged Americans in 1999. Results indicated that in the past 15 years the
prevalence of diabetes has increased by 55% and the prevalence of obesity has increased by
25%. At the state level, Massachusetts ranked first for healthy seniors, while Louisiana ranked
last. Illinois ranked 36th, while Wisconsin scored higher at 13th.
What can we conclude from this information? Lifestyle has a strong impact on the health status
of midlife adults, and it becomes important for midlife adults to take preventative measures to
enhance physical well-being. Those midlife adults who have a strong sense of mastery and
control over their lives, who engage in challenging physical and mental activity, who engage in
weight bearing exercise, monitor their nutrition, receive adequate sleep, and make use of social
resources are most likely to enjoy a plateau of good health through these years (Lachman, 2004).

Climacteric
The climacteric, or the midlife transition when fertility declines, is biologically based but
impacted by the environment. During midlife, men may experience a reduction in their ability to
reproduce. Women, however, lose their ability to reproduce once they reach menopause.
Female Sexual and Reproductive Health: Perimenopause refers to a period of transition in
which a woman's ovaries stop releasing eggs and the level of estrogen and progesterone
production decreases. Menopause is defined as 12 months without menstruation. The average
age of menopause is approximately 51, however, many women begin experiencing symptoms in
their 40s. These symptoms occur during perimenopause, which can occur 2 to 8 years before
menopause (Huang, 2007). A woman may first begin to notice that her periods are more or less
frequent than before. After a year without menstruation, a woman is considered menopausal
and no longer capable of reproduction.
Symptoms: The symptoms that occur during perimenopause and menopause are typically
caused by the decreased production of estrogen and progesterone (North American Menopause
Society, 2016). The shifting hormones can contribute to the inability to fall asleep. Additionally,
the declining levels of estrogen may make a woman more susceptible to environmental factors
and stressors which disrupt sleep. A hot flash is a surge of adrenaline that can awaken the brain
from sleep. It often produces sweat and a change of temperature that can be disruptive to sleep
and comfort levels. Unfortunately, it may take time for adrenaline to recede and allow sleep to
occur again (National Sleep Foundation, 2016).
The loss of estrogen also affects vaginal lubrication which diminishes and becomes waterier and
can contribute to pain during intercourse. The vaginal wall also becomes thinner, and less
elastic. Estrogen is also important for bone formation and growth, and decreased estrogen can
cause osteoporosis resulting in decreased bone mass. Depression, irritability, and weight gain
are often associated with menopause, but they are not menopausal (Avis, Stellato & Crawford,
2001; Rossi, 2004). Weight gain can occur due to an increase in intra-abdominal fat followed by
a loss of lean body mass after menopause (Morita et al., 2006). Consequently, women may need
324

to change their lifestyle to
counter any weight gain.
Depression and mood swings are
more common during menopause
in women who have prior
histories of these conditions
rather than those who have not.
Additionally, the incidence of
depression and mood swings is
not greater among menopausal
women than non-menopausal
women. Figure 8.12 identifies
symptoms experienced by
women during menopause,
however, women vary greatly in
the extent to which these
symptoms are experienced. Most
American women go through
menopause with few problems
(Carroll, 2016). Overall,
menopause is not seen as
universally distressing (Lachman,
2004).

Figure 8.13

Hormone Replacement Therapy: Concerns about the effects of hormone replacement has
changed the frequency with which estrogen replacement and hormone replacement therapies
have been prescribed for menopausal women. Estrogen replacement therapy was once commonly
used to treat menopausal symptoms. However, more recently, hormone replacement therapy has
been associated with breast cancer, stroke, and the development of blood clots (NIH,
2007). Most women do not have symptoms severe enough to warrant estrogen or hormone
replacement therapy. If so, they can be treated with lower doses of estrogen and monitored with
more frequent breast and pelvic exams. There are also some other ways to reduce
symptoms. These include avoiding caffeine and alcohol, eating soy, remaining sexually active,
practicing relaxation techniques, and using water-based lubricants during intercourse.
Menopause and Ethnicity: In a review of studies that mentioned menopause, symptoms varied
greatly across countries, geographic regions, and even across ethnic groups within the same
region (Palacios, Henderson, & Siseles, 2010). For example, the Study of Women's Health
across the Nation (SWAN) examined 14,906 white, African American, Hispanic, Japanese
American, and Chinese American women's menopausal experiences (Avis et al., 2001). After
controlling for age, educational level, general health status, and economic stressors, white
women were more likely to disclose symptoms of depression, irritability, forgetfulness, and
headaches compared to women in the other racial/ethnic groups. African American women
experienced more night sweats, but this varied across research sites. Finally, Chinese American
and Japanese American reported fewer menopausal symptoms when compared to the women in
the other groups. Overall, the Chinese and Japanese group reported the fewest symptoms, while
325

white women reported more mental health symptoms and African American women reported
more physical symptoms.
Cultural Differences: Cultural influences seem to also
play a role in the way menopause is experienced. Further,
the prevalence of language specific to menopause is an
important indicator of the occurrence of menopausal
symptoms in a culture. Hmong tribal women living in
Australia and Mayan women report that there is no word for
"hot flashes" and both groups did not experience these
symptoms (Yick-Flanagan, 2013). When asked about
physical changes during menopause, the Hmong women
reported lighter or no periods. They also reported no
emotional symptoms and found the concept of emotional
difficulties caused by menopause amusing (Thurston &
Vissandjee, 2005). Similarly, a study with First Nation
Source
women in Canada found there was no single word for
"menopause" in the Oji-Cree or Ojibway languages, with
women referring to menopause only as "that time when periods stop" (Madden, St Pierre-Hansen
& Kelly, 2010).
Figure 8.14

While some women focus on menopause as a loss of youth, womanhood, and physical
attractiveness, career-oriented women tend to think of menopause as a liberating experience.
Japanese women perceive menopause as a transition from motherhood to a more whole person,
and they no longer feel obligated to fulfill certain expected social roles, such as the duty to be a
mother (Kagawa-Singer, Wu, & Kawanishi, 2002). In India, 94% of women said they welcomed
menopause. Aging women gain status and prestige and no longer have to go through selfimposed menstrual restrictions, which may contribute to Indian women’s experiences (Kaur,
Walia, & Singh, 2004). Overall, menopause signifies many different things to women around
the world and there is no typical experience. Further, normalizing rather than pathologizing
menopause is supported by research and women’s experiences.
Male Sexual and Reproductive Health: Although males can continue to father children
throughout middle adulthood, erectile dysfunction (ED) becomes more common. Erectile
dysfunction refers to the inability to achieve an erection or an inconsistent ability to achieve an
erection (Swierzewski, 2015). Intermittent ED affects as many as 50% of men between the ages
of 40 and 70. About 30 million men in the United States experience chronic ED, and the
percentages increase with age. Approximately 4% of men in their 40s, 17% of men in their 60s,
and 47% of men older than 75 experience chronic ED.
Causes for ED are primarily due to medical conditions, including diabetes, kidney disease,
alcoholism, and atherosclerosis (build-up of plaque in the arteries). Plaque is made up of fat,
cholesterol, calcium and other substances found in the blood. Over time plaque builds up,
hardens, and restricts the blood flow in the arteries (NIH, 2014d). This build-up limits the flow
of oxygenated blood to organs and the penis. Overall, diseases account for 70% of chronic ED,
while psychological factors, such as stress, depression and anxiety account for 10%-20% of all
cases. Many of these causes are treatable, and ED is not an inevitable result of aging.
326

Figure 8.15 Medical Check-ups are Important for Men

Men during middle adulthood may also experience prostate enlargement, which can interfere
with urination, and deficient testosterone levels which decline throughout adulthood, but
especially after age 50. If testosterone levels decline significantly, it is referred to as
andropause or late-onset hypogonadism. Identifying whether testosterone levels are low is
difficult because individual blood levels vary greatly. Low testosterone is not a concern unless it
accompanied by negative symptoms such as low sex drive, ED, fatigue, loss of muscle, loss of
body hair, or breast enlargement. Low testosterone is also associated with medical conditions,
such as diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure, and testicular cancer. The effectiveness of
supplemental testosterone is mixed, and long term testosterone replacement therapy for men can
increase the risk of prostate cancer, blood clots, heart attack and stroke (WebMD, 2016). Most
men with low testosterone do not have related problems (Berkeley Wellness, 2011).

The Climacteric and Sexuality
Sexuality is an important
part of people's lives at any
age, and many older adults
are very interested in staying
sexually active (Dimah &
Dimah, 2004). According to
the National Survey of
Sexual Health and Behavior
(NSSHB) (Center for Sexual
Health Promotion, 2010),
74% of males and 70% of
females aged 40-49 engaged
in vaginal intercourse during
the previous year, while
58% of males and 51% of
females aged 50-59 did so.

Figure 8.16

327

Despite these percentages indicating that middle adults are sexually active, age-related physical
changes can affect sexual functioning. For women, decreased sexual desire and pain during
vaginal intercourse because of menopausal changes have been identified (Schick et al., 2010). A
woman may also notice less vaginal lubrication during arousal which can affect overall pleasure
(Carroll, 2016). Men may require more direct stimulation for an erection and the erection may be
delayed or less firm (Carroll, 2016). As previously discussed men may experience erectile
dysfunction or experience a medical conditions (such as diabetes or heart disease) that impact
sexual functioning. Couples can continue to enjoy physical intimacy and may engage in more
foreplay, oral sex, and other forms of sexual expression rather than focusing as much on sexual
intercourse.
Risk of pregnancy continues until a woman has been without menstruation for at least 12
months, however, and couples should continue to use contraception. People continue to be at risk
of contracting sexually transmitted infections, such as genital herpes, chlamydia, and genital
warts. In 2014, 16.7% of the country’s new HIV diagnoses (7,391 of 44,071) were among people
50 and older, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2014e). This was an
increase from 15.4% in 2005. Practicing safe sex is important at any age, but unfortunately
adults over the age of 40 have the lowest rates of condom use (Center for Sexual Health
Promotion, 2010). This low rate of condom use suggests the need to enhance education efforts
for older individuals regarding STI risks and prevention. Hopefully, when partners understand
how aging affects sexual expression, they will be less likely to misinterpret these changes as a
lack of sexual interest or displeasure in the partner and more able to continue to have satisfying
and safe sexual relationships.

Brain Functioning
The brain at midlife has been shown to not only maintain many of the abilities of young adults,
but also gain new ones. Some individuals in middle age actually have improved cognitive
functioning (Phillips, 2011). The brain continues to demonstrate plasticity and rewires itself in
middle age based on experiences. Research has demonstrated that older adults use more of their
brains than younger adults. In fact, older adults who perform the best on tasks are more likely to
demonstrate bilateralization than those who perform worst. Additionally, the amount of white
matter in the brain, which is responsible for forming connections among neurons, increases into
the 50s before it declines.
Emotionally, the middle aged brain is calmer, less neurotic, more capable of managing emotions,
and better able to negotiate social situations (Phillips, 2011). Older adults tend to focus more on
positive information and less on negative information than those younger. In fact, they also
remember positive images better than those younger. Additionally, the older adult’s amygdala
responds less to negative stimuli. Lastly, adults in middle adulthood make better financial
decisions, which seems to peak at age 53, and show better economic understanding. Although
greater cognitive variability occurs among middle adults when compared to those both younger
and older, those in midlife with cognitive improvements tend to be more physically, cognitively,
and socially active.

Crystalized versus Fluid Intelligence
Intelligence is influenced by heredity, culture, social contexts, personal choices, and certainly
age. One distinction in specific intelligences noted in adulthood, is between fluid intelligence,
which refers to the capacity to learn new ways of solving problems and performing activities
quickly and abstractly, and crystallized intelligence, which refers to the accumulated knowledge
of the world we have acquired throughout our lives (Salthouse, 2004). These intelligences are
distinct, and crystallized intelligence increases with age, while fluid intelligence tends to decrease
with age (Horn, Donaldson, & Engstrom, 1981; Salthouse, 2004).
Research demonstrates that older adults have more crystallized intelligence as reflected in
semantic knowledge, vocabulary, and language. As a result, adults generally outperform younger
people on measures of history, geography, and even on crossword puzzles, where this
information is useful (Salthouse, 2004). It is this superior knowledge, combined with a slower and
more complete processing style, along with a more sophisticated understanding of the workings
Figure 8.17

Adapted from Horn, Donaldson and Engstrom (1981)

329

of the world around them, that gives older adults the advantage of “wisdom” over the advantages
of fluid intelligence which favor the young (Baltes, Staudinger, & Lindenberger, 1999; Scheibe,
Kunzmann, & Baltes, 2009).
The differential changes in crystallized versus fluid intelligence help explain why older adults do
not necessarily show poorer performance on tasks that also require experience (i.e., crystallized
intelligence), although they show poorer memory overall. A young chess player may think more
quickly, for instance, but a more experienced chess player has more knowledge to draw on.
Seattle Longitudinal Study: The Seattle Longitudinal Study has tracked the cognitive abilities
of adults since 1956. Every seven years the current participants are evaluated, and new
individuals are also added. Approximately 6000 people have participated thus far, and 26 people
from the original group are still in the study today. Current results demonstrate that middle-aged
adults perform better on four out of six cognitive tasks than those same individuals did when
they were young adults. Verbal memory, spatial skills, inductive reasoning (generalizing from
particular examples), and vocabulary increase with age until one’s 70s (Schaie, 2005; Willis &
Shaie, 1999). However, numerical computation and perceptual speed decline in middle and late
adulthood (see Figure 8.18).
Figure 8.18 Seattle Longitudinal Study ages 25 to 88

Cognitive skills in the aging brain have been studied extensively in pilots, and similar to the
Seattle Longitudinal Study results, older pilots show declines in processing speed and memory
capacity, but their overall performance seems to remain intact. According to Phillips (2011)
researchers tested pilots age 40 to 69 as they performed on flight simulators. Older pilots took
longer to learn to use the simulators but performed better than younger pilots at avoiding
collisions.

330

Flow is the mental state of being completely present and fully absorbed in a task
(Csikszentmihalyi, 1990). When in a state of flow, the individual is able to block outside
distractions and the mind is fully open to producing. Additionally, the person is achieving great
joy or intellectual satisfaction from the activity and accomplishing a goal. Further, when in a
state of flow, the individual is not concerned with extrinsic rewards. Csikszentmihalyi (1996)
used his theory of flow to research how some people exhibit high levels of creativity as he
believed that a state of flow is an important factor to creativity (Kaufman & Gregoire, 2016).
Other characteristics of creative people identified by Csikszentmihalyi (1996) include curiosity
and drive, a value for intellectual endeavors, and an ability to lose our sense of self and feel a
part of something greater. In addition, he believed that the tortured creative person was a myth
and that creative people were very happy with their lives. According to Nakamura and
Csikszentmihalyi (2002) people describe flow as the height of enjoyment. The more they
experience it, the more they judge their lives to be gratifying. The qualities that allow for flow
are well-developed in middle adulthood.
Tacit knowledge is knowledge that is pragmatic or practical and learned through experience
rather than explicitly taught, and it also increases with age (Hedlund, Antonakis, & Sternberg,
2002). Tacit knowledge might be thought of as "know-how" or "professional instinct." It is
referred to as tacit because it cannot be codified or written down. It does not involve
academic knowledge, rather it involves being able to use skills and to problem-solve in practical
ways. Tacit knowledge can be understood in the workplace and used by blue collar workers,
such as carpenters, chefs, and hair dressers.

Middle Adults Returning to Education
Midlife adults in the
United States often find
themselves in college
classrooms. In fact, the rate
of enrollment for older
Americans entering
college, often part-time or
in the evenings, is rising
faster than traditionally
aged students. Students
over age 35, accounted for
17% of all college and
graduate students in 2009,
and are expected to
comprise 19% of that total
by 2020 (Holland, 2014).
In some cases, older
students are developing
Source
skills and expertise in
order to launch a second
career, or to take their career in a new direction. Whether they enroll in school to sharpen
particular skills, to retool and reenter the workplace, or to pursue interests that have previously
Figure 8.19 Middle Adults in College

331

been neglected, older students tend to approach the learning process differently than younger
college students (Knowles, Holton, & Swanson, 1998).
The mechanics of cognition, such as working memory and speed of processing, gradually decline
with age. However, they can be easily compensated for through the use of higher order cognitive
skills, such as forming strategies to enhance memory or summarizing and comparing ideas rather
than relying on rote memorization (Lachman, 2004). Although older students may take a bit
longer to learn material, they are less likely to forget it quickly. Adult learners tend to look for
relevance and meaning when learning information. Older adults have the hardest time learning
material that is meaningless or unfamiliar. They are more likely to ask themselves, "Why is this
important?" when being introduced to information or when trying to memorize concepts or
facts. Older adults are more task-oriented learners and want to organize their activity around
problem-solving.
Rubin et al. (2018) surveyed university students aged 17-70 regarding their satisfaction and
approach to learning in college. Results indicated that older students were more independent,
inquisitive, and motivated intrinsically compared to younger students. Additionally, older
women processed information at a deeper learning level and expressed more satisfaction with
their education.
To address the educational needs of those over 50, The American Association of Community
Colleges (2016) developed the Plus 50 Initiative that assists community college in creating or
expanding programs that focus on workforce training and new careers for the plus-50
population. Since 2008 the program has provided grants for programs to 138 community
colleges affecting over 37, 000 students. The participating colleges offer workforce training
programs that prepare 50 plus adults for careers in such fields as early childhood educators,
certified nursing assistants, substance abuse counselors, adult basic education instructors, and
human resources specialists. These training programs are especially beneficial as 80% of people
over the age of 50 say they will retire later in life than their parents or continue to work in
retirement, including in a new field.

Gaining Expertise: The Novice and the Expert
Expertise refers to specialized skills and knowledge that pertain to a particular topic or activity.
In contrast, a novice is someone who has limited experiences with a particular task. Everyone
develops some level of “selective” expertise in things that are personally meaningful to them,
such as making bread, quilting, computer programming, or diagnosing illness. Expert thought is
often characterized as intuitive, automatic, strategic, and flexible.
•

Intuitive: Novices follow particular steps and rules when problem solving, whereas
experts can call upon a vast amount of knowledge and past experience. As a result, their
actions appear more intuitive than formulaic. Novice cooks may slavishly follow the
recipe step by step, while chefs may glance at recipes for ideas and then follow their own
procedure.

•

Automatic: Complex thoughts and actions become more routine for experts. Their
reactions appear instinctive over time, and this is because expertise allows us to process
332

information faster and more effectively (Crawford & Channon, 2002).
•

Strategic: Experts have more effective strategies than non-experts. For instance, while
both skilled and novice doctors generate several hypotheses within minutes of an
encounter with a patient, the more skilled clinicians’ conclusions are likely to be more
accurate. In other words, they generate better hypotheses than the novice. This is because
they are able to discount misleading symptoms and other distractors and hone in on the
most likely problem the patient is experiencing (Norman, 2005). Consider how your note
taking skills may have changed after being in school over a number of years. Chances
are you do not write down everything the instructor says, but the more central ideas. You
may have even come up with your own short forms for commonly mentioned words in a
course, allowing you to take down notes faster and more efficiently than someone who
may be a novice academic note taker.

•

Flexible: Experts in all fields are more curious and creative; they enjoy a challenge and
experiment with new ideas or procedures. The only way for experts to grow in their
knowledge is to take on more challenging, rather than routine tasks.

Expertise takes time. It is a long-process resulting from experience and practice (Ericsson,
Feltovich, & Prietula, 2006). Middle-aged adults, with their store of knowledge and experience,
are likely to find that when faced with a problem they have likely faced something similar
before. This allows them to ignore the irrelevant and focus on the important aspects of the issue.
Expertise is one reason why many people often reach the top of their career in middle adulthood.
However, expertise cannot fully make-up for all losses in general cognitive functioning as we
age. The superior performance of older adults in comparison to younger novices appears to be
task specific (Charness & Krampe, 2006). As we age, we also need to be more deliberate in our
practice of skills in order to maintain them. Charness and Krampe (2006) in their review of the
literature on aging and expertise, also note that the rate of return for our effort diminishes as we
age. In other words, increasing practice does not recoup the same advances in older adults as
similar efforts do at younger ages.

Work at Midlife
Who is the U.S. workforce? The civilian, non-institutionalized workforce; the population of
those aged 16 and older, who are employed has steadily declined since it reached its peak in the
late 1990s, when 67% of the civilian workforce population was employed. In 2012 the rate had
dropped to 64% and by 2019 it declined to 62.9% (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2019). The U.S.
population is expected to grow more slowly based on census projections for the next few years.
Those new entrants to the labor force, adults age 16 to 24, are the only population of adults that
will shrink in size over the next few years by nearly half a percent, while those age 55 and up
will grow by 2.3% over current rates, and those age 65 to 74 will grow by nearly 4% (Monthly
Labor Review (MLR), 2013). In 1992, 26% of the population was 55+, by 2022 it is projected to
be 38%. Table 8.8 shows the rates of employment by age. In 2002, baby boomers were between
the ages of 38 to 56, the prime employment group. In 2012, the youngest baby boomers were 48
and the oldest had just retired (age 66). These changes might explain some of the steady decline
in work participation as this large population cohort ages out of the workforce.
333

In 2012, 53% of the workforce was male. For both genders and for most age groups the rate of
participation in the labor force has declined from 2002 to 2012, and it is projected to decline
further by 2022. The exception is among the older middle-age groups (the baby boomers), and
especially for women 55 and older.

Hispanic males have the highest rate of participation in the labor force. In 2012, 76% of
Hispanic males, compared with 71% of White, 72% of Asian, and 64% of Black men ages 16 or
older were employed. Among women, Black women were more likely to be participating in the
workforce (58%) compared with almost 57% of Hispanic and Asian, and 55% of White females.
The rates for all racial and ethnic groups are expected to decline by 2022 (MLR, 2013).
Climate in the Workplace for Middle-aged Adults: A number of studies have found that job
satisfaction tends to peak in middle adulthood (Besen, Matz-Costa, Brown, Smyer, & PittCatsouphers, 2013; Easterlin, 2006). This satisfaction stems from not only higher wages, but
often greater involvement in decisions that affect the workplace as they move from worker to
supervisor or manager. Job satisfaction is also influenced by being able to do the job well, and
after years of experience at a job many people are more effective and productive. Another
reason for this peak in job satisfaction is that at midlife many adults lower their expectations and
goals (Tangri, Thomas, & Mednick, 2003). Middle-aged employees may realize they have
reached the highest they are likely to in their career. This satisfaction at work translates into
lower absenteeism, greater productivity, and less job hopping in comparison to younger adults
(Easterlin, 2006).
However, not all middle-aged adults are happy in the work place. Women may find themselves
up against the glass ceiling. This may explain why females employed at large corporations are
twice as likely to quit their jobs as are men (Barreto, Ryan, & Schmitt, 2009). Another problem
older workers may encounter is job burnout, defined as unsuccessfully managed work place
stress (World Health Organization, 2019). Burnout consists of:
•
•
•

Feelings of energy depletion or exhaustion
Increased mental distance from one’s job, or feelings of job negativism or cynicism
Reduced professional efficacy
334

American workers may
experience more burnout than
do workers in many other
developed nations, because
most developed nations
guarantee by law a set number
of paid vacation days
(International Labour
Organization, ILO, 2011), the
United States does not (U.S.
Department of Labor, 2016).

Hours
considered that the 40-hour
work week is a myth for most Americans. Only 4 in 10 U.S. workers work the typical 40-hour
work week. The average work week for many is almost a full day longer (47 hours), with 39%
working 50 or more hours per week (Saad, 2014). In comparision to workers in many other
developed nations, American workers work more hours per year (Organisation for Economic
Cooperation and Development, OECD, 2016). As can be seen in Figure 8.20, Americans work
more hours than most European nations, especially western and northern Europe, althouigh they
work less hours than workers in other nations, especially Mexico.
Challenges in the Workplace for Middleaged Adults: In recent years middle aged
adults have been challenged by economic
downturns, starting in 2001, and again in
2008. Fifty-five percent of adults reported
some problems in the workplace, such as
fewer hours, pay-cuts, having to switch to
part-time, etc., during the most recent
economic recession (see Figure 8.21, Pew
Research Center, 2010a). While young
adults took the biggest hit in terms of levels
of unemployment, middle-aged adults also
saw their overall financial resources suffer
as their retirement nest eggs disappeared and
house values shrank, while foreclosures
increased (Pew Research Center, 2010b).
Not surprisingly this age group reported that
the recession hit them worse than did other
age groups, especially those age 50-64.
Middle aged adults who find themselves
unemployed are likely to remain
unemployed longer than those in early

Figure 8.21

335

adulthood (U.S. Government Accountability Office, 2012). In the eyes of employers, it may be
more cost effective to hire a young adult, despite their limited experience, as they would be
starting out at lower levels of the pay scale. In addition, hiring someone who is 25 and has many
years of work ahead of them versus someone who is 55 and will likely retire in 10 years may
also be part of the decision to hire a younger worker (Lachman, 2004). American workers are
also competing with global markets and changes in technology. Those who are able to keep up
with all these changes or are willing to uproot and move around the country or even the world
have a better chance of finding work. The decision to move may be easier for people who are
younger and have fewer obligations to others.

Leisure
As most developed nations restrict the number of hours an employer can demand that an
employee work per week, and require employers to offer paid vacation time, what do middle
aged adults do with their time off from work and duties, referred to as leisure? Around the world
the most common leisure activity in both early and middle adulthood is watching television
(Marketing Charts Staff, 2014). On average, middle aged adults spend 2-3 hours per day
watching TV (Gripsrud, 2007) and watching TV accounts for more than half of all the leisure
time (see Figure 8.22).
Figure 8.22

In the United States, men spend about 5 hours more per week in leisure activities, especially on
weekends, than do women (Drake, 2013; U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2016). The leisure gap
336

between mothers and fathers is slightly smaller, about 3 hours a week, than among those without
children under age 18 (Drake, 2013). Those age 35-44 spend less time on leisure activities than
any other age group, 15 or older (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2016). This is not surprising as
this age group are more likely to be parents and still working up the ladder of their career, so
they may feel they have less time for leisure.
Americans have less leisure time than people in many other developed nations. As you read
earlier, there are no laws in many job sectors guaranteeing paid vacation time in the United
States (see Figure 8.23). Ray, Sanes and Schmitt (2013) report that several other nations also
provide additional time off for young and older workers and for shift workers. In the United
States, those in higher paying jobs and jobs covered by a union contract are more likely to have
paid vacation time and holidays (Ray & Schmitt, 2007).
Figure 8.23 Legally Mandated Time Off

But do U.S. workers take their time off? According to Project Time-Off (2016), 55% of U.S.
workers in 2015 did not take all of their paid vacation and holiday leave. A large percentage of
this leave is lost. It cannot be rolled-over into the next year or paid out. A total of 658 million
vacation days, or an average of 2 vacation days per worker was lost in 2015. The reasons most
often given for not taking time off was worry that there would be a mountain of work to return to
(40%), concern that no one else could do the job (35%), not being able to afford a vacation
(33%), feeling it was harder to take time away when you have or are moving up in the company
(33%), and not wanting to seem replaceable (22%). Since 2000, more American workers are
willing to work for free rather than take the time that is allowed to them. A lack of support from
their boss and even their colleagues to take a vacation is often a driving force in deciding to
337

forgo time off. In fact, 80% of the respondents to the survey above said they would take time
away if they felt they had support from their boss. Two-thirds reported that they hear nothing,
mixed messages, or discouraging remarks about taking their time off. Almost a third (31%) feel
they should contact their workplace, even while on vacation.
The benefits of taking time away from work: Several studies have noted the benefits of taking
time away from work. It reduces job stress burnout (Nimrod, Kleiber, & Berdychevesky, 2012),
improves both mental health (Qian, Yarnal, & Almeida, 2013) and physical health (Stern &
Konno, 2009), especially if that leisure time also includes moderate physical activity (Lee et al.,
2015). Leisure activities can also improve productivity and job satisfaction (Kühnel &
Sonnentag, 2011) and help adults deal with balancing family and work obligations (Lee, et al.,
2015).

There are many socioemotional changes that occur in how middle-aged adults perceive
themselves. While people in their early 20s may emphasize how old they are to gain respect or to
be viewed as experienced, by the time people reach their 40s they tend to emphasize how young
they are. For instance, few 40 year olds cut each other down for being so young stating: "You're
only 43? I'm 48!” A previous focus on the future gives way to an emphasis on the present.
Neugarten (1968) notes that in midlife, people no longer think of their lives in terms of how long
they have lived. Rather, life is thought of in terms of how many years are left.

Midlife Crisis?
In 1978 Daniel Levinson published a book entitled The Seasons of a Man’s Life in which he
presented a theory of development in adulthood. Levinson’s work was based on in-depth
interviews with 40 men between the ages of 35-45. Levinson (1978) indicated that adults go
through stages and have an image of the future that motivates them. This image is called “the
dream” and for the men interviewed, it was a dream of how their career paths would progress
and where they would be at midlife. According to Levinson the midlife transition (40-45) was a
338

time of reevaluating previous commitments; making dramatic changes if necessary; giving
expression to previously ignored talents or aspirations; and feeling more of a sense of urgency
about life and its meaning. By the time the men entered middle adulthood (45-50), they believed
they committed to the new choices made and placed one’s energies into these commitments.
Levinson believed that a midlife crisis was a normal part of development as the person is more
aware of how much time has gone by and how much time is left. The future focus of early
adulthood gives way to an emphasis on the present in midlife, and the men interviewed had
difficulty reconciling the “dream” they held about the future with the reality they experienced.
Consequently, they felt impatient and were no longer willing to postpone the things they had
always wanted to do. Although Levinson believed his research demonstrated the existence of a
midlife crisis, his study has been criticized for his research methods, including small sample size,
similar ages, and concerns about a cohort effect. In fact, other research does not support his
theory of the midlife crisis.
Vaillant (2012) believed that it was the cross-sectional design of Levinson’s study that led to the
erroneous conclusion of an inevitable midlife crisis. Instead, he believed that longitudinal
studies of an individual’s entire life was needed to determine the factors associated with
optimum health and potential. Vaillant was one of the main researchers in the 75 year-old
Harvard Study of Adult Development, and he considered a midlife crisis to be a rare occurrence
among the participants (Vaillant, 1977). Additional findings of this longitudinal study will be
discussed in the next chapter on late adulthood.
Most research suggests that most people in the United States today do not experience a midlife
crisis. Results of a 10-year study conducted by the MacArthur Foundation Research Network on
Successful Midlife Development, based on telephone interviews with over 3,000 midlife adults,
suggest that the years between 40 and 60 are ones marked by a sense of well-being. Only 23% of
their participants reported experiencing a midlife crisis. The crisis tended to occur among the
highly educated and was triggered by a major life event rather than out of a fear of aging
(Research Network on Successful Midlife Development, 2007).

Stress
Figure 8.24 Are you Stressed?

Stress

We all know that stress plays a major role in our mental
and physical health, but what exactly is stress? The
term stress is defined as a pattern of physical and
psychological responses in an organism after it
perceives a threatening event that disturbs its
homeostasis and taxes its abilities to cope with the
event (Hooker & Pressman, 2016). Stress was originally
derived from the field of mechanics where it is used to
describe materials under pressure. The word was first
used in a psychological manner by researcher Hans
Selye, who was examining the effect of an ovarian
hormone that he thought caused sickness in a sample of
rats. Surprisingly, he noticed that almost any injected
339

hormone produced this same sickness. He smartly realized that it was not the hormone under
investigation that was causing these problems, but instead the aversive experience of being
handled and injected by researchers led to high physiological arousal, and eventually to health
problems like ulcers.
Selye (1946) coined the term
stressor to label a stimulus that
had this effect on the body (that
is, causing stress). He
developed a model of the stress
response called the General
Adaptation Syndrome, which
is a three-phase model of
stress, which includes a
mobilization of physiological
resources phase, a coping
phase, and an exhaustion phase
(i.e., when an organism fails to
cope with the stress adequately
and depletes its resources).

General Adaptation Syndrome.

Psychologists have studied stress in a myriad of ways, and it is not just major life stressor (e.g., a
family death, a natural disaster) that increase the likelihood of getting sick. Stress can result from
negative events, chronically difficult situations, a biological fight-or-flight response, and as
clinical illness, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Even small daily hassles, like
getting stuck in traffic or fighting with your friend, can raise your blood pressure, alter your
stress hormones, and even suppress your immune system function (DeLongis, Folkman, &
Lazarus, 1988; Twisk, Snel, Kemper, & van Machelen, 1999). Stress continues to be one of the
most important and well-studied psychological correlates of illness, because excessive stress
causes potentially damaging wear and tear on the body and can influence almost any disease
process.
Dispositions and Stress: Negative dispositions and personality traits have been strongly tied to
an array of health risks. One of the earliest negative trait-to-health connections was discovered in
the 1950s by two cardiologists. They made the interesting discovery that there were common
behavioral and psychological patterns among their heart patients that were not present in other
patient samples. This pattern included being competitive, impatient, hostile, and time urgent.
They labeled it Type A Behavior. Importantly, it was found to be associated with double the
risk of heart disease as compared with Type B Behavior (absence of Type A behaviors)
(Friedman & Rosenman, 1959). Since the 1950s, researchers have discovered that it is the
hostility and competitiveness components of Type A that are especially harmful to heart health
340

(Iribarren et al., 2000; Matthews, Glass, Rosenman, & Bortner, 1977; Miller, Smith, Turner,
Guijarro, & Hallet, 1996). Hostile individuals are quick to get upset, and this angry arousal can
damage the arteries of the heart. In addition, given their negative personality style, hostile people
often lack a heath-protective supportive social network.
Social Relationships and Stress: Research has shown that
the impact of social isolation on our risk for disease and death
is similar in magnitude to the risk associated with smoking
regularly (Holt-Lunstad, Smith, & Layton, 2010; House,
Landis, & Umberson, 1988). In fact, the importance of social
relationships for our health is so significant that some
scientists believe our body has developed a physiological
system that encourages us to seek out our relationships,
especially in times of stress (Taylor et al., 2000). Social
integration is the concept used to describe the number of
social roles that you have (Cohen & Willis, 1985). For
example, you might be a daughter, a basketball team member,
a Humane Society volunteer, a coworker, and a student.
Maintaining these different roles can improve your health via
encouragement from those around you to maintain a healthy
lifestyle. Those in your social network might also provide
you with social support (e.g., when you are under stress).
This support might include emotional help (e.g., a hug when
you need it), tangible help (e.g., lending you money), or
Source
advice. By helping to improve health behaviors and reduce
stress, social relationships can have a powerful, protective impact on health, and in some cases,
might even help people with serious illnesses stay alive longer (Spiegel, Kraemer, Bloom, &
Gottheil, 1989).

Caregiving and Stress: A disabled child, spouse, parent, or other family member is part of the
lives of some midlife adults. According to the National Alliance for Caregiving (2015), 40
million Americans provide unpaid caregiving. The typical caregiver is a 49 year-old female
currently caring for a 69 year-old female who needs care because of a long-term physical
condition. Looking more closely at the age of the recipient of caregiving, the typical caregiver
for those 18-49 years of age is a female (61%) caring mostly for her own child (32%) followed
by a spouse or partner (17%). When looking at older recipients (50+) who receive care, the
typical caregiver is female (60%) caring for a parent (47%) or spouse (10%).
Caregiving places enormous stress on the caregiver. Caregiving for a young or adult child with
special needs was associated with poorer global health and more physical symptoms among both
fathers and mothers (Seltzer, Floyd, Song, Greenberg, & Hong, 2011). Marital relationships are
also a factor in how the caring affects stress and chronic conditions. Fathers who were
caregivers identified more chronic health conditions than non-caregiving fathers, regardless of
marital quality. In contrast, caregiving mothers reported higher levels of chronic conditions
when they reported a high level of marital strain (Kang & Marks, 2014). Age can also make a
341

difference in how one is affected by the stress of caring for a child with special needs. Using data
from the Study of Midlife in the Unites States, Ha, Hong, Seltzer and Greenberg (2008) found
that older parents were significantly less likely to experience the negative effects of having a
disabled child than younger parents. They concluded that an age-related weakening of the stress
occurred over time. This follows with the greater emotional stability noted at midlife.
Currently 25% of adult children, mainly baby boomers, provide personal or financial care to a
parent (Metlife, 2011). Daughters are more likely to provide basic care and sons are more likely
to provide financial assistance. Adult children 50+ who work and provide care to a parent are
more likely to have fair or poor health when compared to those who do not provide care. Some
adult children choose to leave the work force, however, the cost of leaving the work force early
to care for a parent is high. For females, lost wages and social security benefits equals $324,044,
while for men it equals $283,716 (Metlife, 2011). This loss can jeopardize the adult child’s
financial future. Consequently, there is a need for greater workplace flexibility for working
caregivers.
Spousal Care: Certainly, caring for a disabled spouse would be a difficult experience that could
negatively affect one’s health. However, research indicates that there can be positive health
effect for caring for a disabled spouse. Beach, Schulz, Yee and Jackson (2000) evaluated health
related outcomes in four groups: Spouses with no caregiving needed (Group 1), living with a
disabled spouse but not providing care (Group 2), living with a disabled spouse and providing
care (Group 3), and helping a disabled spouse while reporting caregiver strain, including
elevated levels of emotional and physical stress (Group 4). Not surprisingly, the participants in
Group 4 were the least healthy and identified poorer perceived health, an increase in health-risk
behaviors, and an increase in anxiety and depression symptoms. However, those in Group 3 who
provided care for a spouse, but did not identify caregiver strain, actually identified decreased
levels of anxiety and depression compared to Group 2 and were actually similar to those in
Group 1. It appears that greater caregiving involvement was related to better mental health as
long as the caregiving spouse did not feel strain. The beneficial effects of helping identified by
the participants were consistent with previous research (Krause, Herzog, & Baker, 1992; Schulz
et al., 1997).
When caring for a disabled spouse, gender differences
Figure 8.27 Caregiving for females
have also been identified. Female caregivers of a
is associated with greater stress
spouse with dementia experienced more burden, had
poorer mental and physical health, exhibited increased
depressive symptomatology, took part in fewer healthpromoting activities, and received fewer hours of help
than male caregivers (Gibbons et al., 2014). This
study was consistent with previous research findings
that women experience more caregiving burden than
men, despite similar caregiving situations (Torti,
Gwyther, Reed, Friedman, & Schulman, 2004;
Yeager, Hyer, Hobbs, & Coyne, 2010). Explanations
Source
for why women do not use more external support,
which may alleviate some of the burden, include
women’s expectations that they should assume caregiving roles (Torti et al, 2004) and their
342

concerns with the opinions of others (Arai, Sugiura, Miura, Washio, & Kudo, 2000). Also
contributing to women’s poorer caregiving outcomes is that disabled males are more aggressive
than females, especially males with dementia who display more physical and sexual aggression
toward their caregivers (Eastley & Wilcock, 1997; Zuidema, de Jonghe, Verhey, & Koopmans,
2009). Female caregivers are certainly at risk for negative consequences of caregiving, and
greater support needs to be available to them.
Stress Management: On a scale from 1 to 10, those Americans aged 39-52 rated their stress at
5.3, and those aged 53-71 rated their stress at 3.9 (American Psychological Association, 2017).
The most common sources of stress included the future of our nation, money, work, current
political climate, and violence and crime. Given that these sources of our stress are often difficult
to change, a number of interventions have been designed to help reduce the aversive responses to
duress, especially related to health. For example, relaxation activities and forms of meditation are
techniques that allow individuals to reduce their stress via breathing exercises, muscle relaxation,
and mental imagery. Physiological arousal from stress can also be reduced via biofeedback, a
technique where the individual is shown bodily information that is not normally available to
them (e.g., heart rate), and then taught strategies to alter this signal. This type of intervention
has even shown promise in reducing heart and hypertension risk, as well as other serious
conditions (Moravec, 2008; Patel, Marmot, & Terry, 1981). Reducing stress does not have to be
complicated. For example, exercise is a great stress reduction activity (Salmon, 2001) that has a
myriad of health benefits.
Coping Strategies: Coping is often classified into
Figure 8.28 How do you cope with
two categories: Problem-focused coping or
stress when stuck in traffic?
emotion-focused coping (Carver, Scheier, &
Weintraub, 1989). Problem-focused coping is
thought of as actively addressing the event that is
causing stress in an effort to solve the issue at
hand. For example, say you have an important
exam coming up next week. A problem-focused
strategy might be to spend additional time over the
weekend studying to make sure you understand all
of the material. Emotion-focused coping, on the
other hand, regulates the emotions that come with
Source
stress. In the above examination example, this
might mean watching a funny movie to take your
mind off the anxiety you are feeling. In the short term, emotion-focused coping might reduce
feelings of stress, but problem-focused coping seems to have the greatest impact on mental
wellness (Billings & Moos, 1981; Herman-Stabl, Stemmler, & Petersen, 1995). That being said,
when events are uncontrollable (e.g., the death of a loved one), emotion-focused coping directed
at managing your feelings, at first, might be the better strategy. Therefore, it is always important
to consider the match of the stressor to the coping strategy when evaluating its plausible benefits.

Erikson: Generativity vs Stagnation
According to Erikson (1950, 1982) generativity encompasses procreativity, productivity, and
creativity. This stage includes the generation of new beings, new products, and new ideas, as
well as self-generation concerned with further identity development. Erikson believed that the
stage of generativity, during which one established a family and career, was the longest of all the
stages. Individuals at midlife are primarily concerned with leaving a positive legacy of
themselves, and parenthood is the primary generative type. Erikson understood that work and
family relationships may be in conflict due to the obligations and responsibilities of each, but he
believed it was overall a positive developmental time. In addition to being parents and working,
Erikson also described individuals being involved in the community during this stage. A sense
of stagnation occurs when one is not active in generative matters, however, stagnation can
motive a person to redirect energies into more meaningful activities.
Erikson identified “virtues” for each of his eight stages, and the virtue emerging when one
achieves generativity is “Care”. Erikson believed that those in middle adulthood should “take
care of the persons, the products, and the ideas one has learned to care for” (Erikson, 1982, p.
67). Further, Erikson believed that the strengths gained from the six earlier stages are essential
for the generational task of cultivating strength in the next generation. Erikson further argued
that generativity occurred best after the individual had resolved issues of identity and intimacy
(Peterson & Duncan, 2007).
Research has demonstrated that generative adults
Figure 8.29 Generativity at Midlife
possess many positive characteristics, including
good cultural knowledge and healthy adaptation to
the world (Peterson & Duncan, 2007). Using the
Big 5 personality traits, generative women and men
scored high on conscientiousness, extraversion,
agreeableness, openness to experience, and low on
neuroticism (de St. Aubin & McAdams, 1995;
Peterson, Smirles, & Wentworth, 1997).
Additionally, women scoring high in generativity at
age 52, were rated high in positive personality
characteristics, satisfaction with marriage and
Source
motherhood, and successful aging at age 62
(Peterson & Duncan, 2007). Similarly, men rated higher in generativity at midlife were
associated with stronger global cognitive functioning (e.g., memory, attention, calculation),
stronger executive functioning (e.g., response inhibition, abstract thinking, cognitive flexibility),
and lower levels of depression in late adulthood (Malone, Liu, Vaillant, Rentz, & Waldinger,
2016).
Erikson (1982) indicated that at the end of this demanding stage, individuals may withdraw as
generativity is no longer expected in late adulthood. This releases elders from the task of care
taking or working. However, not feeling needed or challenged may result in stagnation, and
consequently one should not fully withdraw from generative tasks as they enter Erikson’s last
stage in late adulthood.

Midlife Relationships
The sandwich generation refers to adults who have at least one parent age 65 or older and are
either raising their own children or providing support for their grown children. According to a
recent Pew Research survey, 47% of
Figure 8.30
middle-aged adults are part of this
sandwich generation (Parker & Patten,
2013). In addition, 15% of middle-aged
adults are providing financial support to
an older parent while raising or
supporting their own children (see Figure
8.30). According to the same survey,
almost half (48%) of middle-aged adults,
have supported their adult children in the
past year, and 27% are the primary source
of support for their grown children.
Seventy-one percent of the sandwich
generation is age 40-59, 19% were
younger than 40, and 10% were 60 or
older. Hispanics are more likely to find themselves supporting two generations; 31% have
parents 65 or older and a dependent child, compared with 24% of whites and 21% of blacks
(Parker & Patten, 2013). Women are more likely to take on the role of care provider for older
parents in the U.S. and Germany (Pew Research, 2015). About 20% of women say they have
helped with personal care, such as getting dressed or bathing, of aging parents in the past year,
compared with 8% of men in the U.S. and 4% in Germany. In contrast, in Italy men are just as
likely (25%) as women (26%) to have provided personal care.
The Pew survey found that almost 33% of the
sandwich-generation adults were more likely
to say they always feel rushed, while only
23% of other adults said this. However, the
survey suggests that those who were
supporting both parents and children reported
being just as happy as those middle-aged
adults who did not find themselves in the
sandwich generation (Parker & Patten, 2013).
Adults who are supporting both parents and
children did report greater financial strain
(see Figure 8.31). Only 28% reported that
they were living comfortably versus 41% of
those who were not also supporting their
parents. Almost 33% were just making ends
meet, compared with 17% of those who did
not have the additional financial burden of
aging parents.

Figure 8.31

345

Kinkeeping: At midlife adults may find themselves as a kinkeeper. In all families there is a
person or persons who keep the family connected and who promote solidarity and continuity in
the family (Brown & DeRycke, 2010). Who in your own family do you count on to organize
family gatherings? Who knows the history of your family? Who do people turn to in your family
for advice and support? Who works to strengthen the bonds between members of your family?
These are your family’s kinkeepers, and they are usually women (Leach & Braithwaite, 1996;
Brown & DeRycke, 2010). Leach and Braithwaite found that 86% of their respondents named a
woman as their family’s kinkeeper, and Brown and DeRycke found that mothers, maternal
grandmothers, and paternal grandmothers were more likely to be a family’s kinkeeper than were
fathers, young adult children, and grandfathers combined. Brown and DeRycke also found that
among young adults, women were more likely to be a kinkeeper than were young adult men.
Kinkeeping can be a source of distress when it interferes with other obligations (Gerstel &
Gallagher, 1993). Gerstel and Gallagher found that on average, kinkeepers provide almost a full
week of work each month to kinkeeping (almost 34 hours). They also found that the more
activities the kinkeeper took on, and the more kin they helped the more stress and higher the
levels of depression a kinkeeper experienced. However, unlike other studies on kinkeeping,
Gerstel and Gallagher also included a number of activities that would be considered more
“caregiving,” such as providing transportation, making repairs, providing meals, etc. in addition
to the usual activities of kinkeeping.
Empty nest: The empty nest, or post-parental period refers to the time period when children are
grown up and have left home (Dennerstein, Dudley & Guthrie, 2002). For most parents this
occurs during midlife. This time is recognized as a “normative event” as parents are aware that
their children will become adults and eventually leave home (Mitchell & Lovegreen, 2009). The
empty nest creates complex emotions, both positive and negative, for many parents. Some
theorists suggest this is a time of role loss for parents, others suggest it is one of role strain relief
(Bouchard, 2013).
The role loss hypothesis predicts that when people lose an important role in their life they
experience a decrease in emotional well-being. It is from this perspective that the concept of the
empty nest syndrome emerged, which refers to great emotional distress experienced by
parents, typically mothers, after children have left home. The empty nest syndrome is linked to
the absence of alternative roles for the parent in which they could establish their identity
(Borland, 1982). In Bouchard’s (2013) review of the research, she found that few parents
reported loneliness or a big sense of loss once all their children had left home.
In contrast, the role stress relief hypothesis suggests that the empty nest period should lead to
more positive changes for parents, as the responsibility of raising children has been lifted. The
role strain relief hypothesis was supported by many studies in Bouchard’s (2013) review. A
consistent finding throughout the research literature is that raising children has a negative impact
on the quality of martial relationships (Ahlborg, Misvaer, & Möller, 2009; Bouchard, 2013).
Most studies have reported that martial satisfaction often increases during the launching phase of
the empty nest period, and that this satisfaction endures long after the last child has left home
(Gorchoff, John, & Helson, 2008).
However, most of the research on the post-parental period has been with American parents. A
number of studies in China suggest that empty-nesters, especially in more rural areas of China,
346

report greater loneliness and depression than their counterparts with children still at home (Wu et
al., 2010). Family support for the elderly by their children is a cherished Chinese tradition (Wong
& Leung, 2012). With children moving from the rural communities to the larger cities for
education and employment this may explain the more pessimistic reaction of Chinese parents
than in American samples. The loss of an adult child in a rural region may mean a loss of family
income for aging parents. Empty-nesters in urban regions of China did not report the same
degree of distress (Su et al., 2012), suggesting that it not so much the event of children leaving,
but the additional hardships this may place on aging parents.
Boomerang Kids: As you read in Chapter 7, young
adults are living with their parents for a longer duration
and in greater numbers than previous generations. In
addition to those in early adulthood who are not leaving
the home of their parents, there are also young adults who
are returning after having lived independently outside the
home, and these are called boomerang kids. Figure 8.32
shows the number of American young people 25-35 who
were living at home based on their generation (Fry,
2017). Figure 8.33 shows that more young adults 18-34
in Europe are also living with their parents (Desilver,
2016). Many of the same financial reasons that are
influencing young people’s decisions to delay exit from
the home of their parents are underlying their decisions to
return home. In addition, to financial reasons, some
boomerang kids are returning because of emotional
distress, such as mental health issues (Sandberg-Thoma,
Snyder, & Jang, 2015).

Figure 8.32

What is the effect on parents when their adult children
return home? Certainly, there is considerable research
that shows that the stress of raising children can have a
negative impact on parents’ well-being, and that when
children leave home many couples experience less stress and greater life satisfaction (see the
section on the empty nest). Early research in the 1980s and 1990s supported the notion that
boomerang children, along with those who were failing to exit the home, placed greater financial
hardship on the parents, and the parents reported more negative perceptions of this living
arrangement (Aquilino, 1991). Recent surveys suggest that today’s parents are more tolerant of
this, perhaps because this is becoming a more normative experience than in the past. Moreover,
children who return are more likely to have had good relationships with their parents growing up,
so there may be less stress between parents and their adult children who return (Sandberg-Thoma
et al., 2015). Parents of young adults who have moved back home because of economic reasons
report that they are just as satisfied with their life as are parents whose adult children are still
living independently (Parker, 2012). Parker found that adult children age 25 and older are more
likely to contribute financially to the family or complete chores and other household duties.
Parker also found that living in a multigenerational household may be acting as an economic
safety net for young adults. In comparison to young adults who were living outside of the home,
those living with their parents were less likely to be living in poverty (17% versus 10%).
347

So far, we have considered the impact that
adult children who have returned home or
have yet to leave the nest have on the lives
of middle-aged parents. What about the
effect on parents who have adult children
dealing with personal problems, such as
alcoholism, chronic health concerns,
mental health issues, trouble with the law,
poor social relationships, or academic or
job related problems, even if they are not
living at home? The life course
perspective proposes the idea of linked
lives (Greenfield & Marks, 2006). The
notion that people in important
relationships, such as children and
parents, mutually influence each other’s
developmental pathways. In previous
chapters you have read about the effects
that parents have on their children’s
development, but this relationship is
bidirectional. The problems faced by
children, even when those children are
adults, influence the lives of their parents.
Greenfield and Marks found in their study
of middle-aged parents and their adult
children, those parents whose children
were dealing with personal problems
reported more negative affect, lower self-acceptance, poorer parent-child interactions, and more
family relationship stress. The more problems the adult children were facing, the worse the lives
and emotional health of their parents, with single parents faring the worst.
Figure 8.33

Middle Adult Lifestyles
Singlehood: According to a Pew Research study, 16 per 1,000 adults age 45 to 54 and 7 per
1000 age 55 and over have never-married in the U. S. (Wang & Parker, 2014). However, some
of them may be living with a partner. In addition, some singles at midlife may be single through
divorce or widowhood. DePaulo (2014) has challenged the idea that singles, especially the
always single, fair worse emotionally and in health when compared to those married. DePaulo
suggests there is a bias in how studies examine the benefits of marriage. Most studies focus on
comparisons between married versus not married, which do not include a separate comparison
between those always single, and those who are single because of divorce or widowhood. Her
research has found that those who are married may be more satisfied with life than the divorced
or widowed, but there is little difference between married and always single, especially when
comparing those who are recently married with those who have been married for four or more
years. It appears that once the initial blush of the honeymoon wears off, those who are wedded
are no happier or healthier than those who remained single. This might also suggest that there
may be problems with how the “married” category is also seen as one homogeneous group.
348

Online Dating: Montenegro (2003) surveyed over 3,000 singles aged 40–69, and almost half of
the participants reported their most important reason for dating was to have someone to talk to or
do things with. Additionally, sexual fulfillment was also identified as an important goal for
many. Alterovitz & Mendelsohn (2013) reviewed online personal ads for men and women over
age 40 and found that romantic activities and sexual interests were mentioned at similar rates
among the middle-age and young-old age groups, but less for the old-old age group.
Marriage: As you read in Chapter
Figure 8.34
7, there has been a number of
changes in the marriage rate as more
people are cohabitating, more are
deciding to stay single, and more are
getting married at a later age. As
you can see in Figure 8.34, 48% of
adults age 45-54 are married; either
in their first marriage (22%) or have
remarried (26%). This makes
marriage the most common
relationship status for middle-aged
adults in the United States. Marital
satisfaction tends to increase for
many couples in midlife as children
are leaving home (Landsford,
Antonucci, Akiyama, & Takahashi,
2005). Not all researchers agree.
They suggest that those who are
unhappy with their marriage are
likely to have gotten divorced by
now, making the quality of marriages later in life only look more satisfactory (Umberson,
Williams, Powers, Chen, & Campbell, 2005).
Divorce: Livingston (2014) found that 27% of adults age 45 to 54 were divorced (see Figure
8.32). Additionally, 57% of divorced adults were women. This reflects the fact that men are
more likely to remarry than are women. Two-thirds of divorces are initiated by women (AARP,
2009). Most divorces take place within the first 5 to 10 years of marriage. This time line reflects
people’s initial attempts to salvage the relationship. After a few years of limited success, the
couple may decide to end the marriage. It used to be that divorce after having been married for
20 or more years was rare, but in recent years the divorce rate among more long-term marriages
has been increasing. Brown and Lin (2013) note that while the divorce rate in the U.S. has
declined since the 1990s, the rate among those 50 and older has doubled. They suggest several
reasons for the “graying of divorce”. There is less stigma attached to divorce today than in the
past. Some older women are out-earning their spouses, and thus may be more financially capable
of supporting themselves, especially as most of their children have grown. Finally, given
increases in human longevity, the prospect of living several more years or decades with an
incompatible spouse may prompt middle-aged and older adults to leave the marriage.

349

Gottman and Levenson (2000) found that the divorces in early adulthood were angrier and
conflictual, with each partner blaming the other for the failures in the marriage. In contrast, they
found that at midlife divorces tended to be more about having grown apart, or a cooling off of
the relationship. A survey by AARP (2009) found that men and women had diverse motivations
for getting a divorce. Women reported concerns about the verbal and physical abusiveness of
their partner (23%), drug/alcohol abuse (18%), and infidelity (17%). In contrast, men mentioned
they had simply fallen out of love (17%), no longer shared interests or values (14%), and
infidelity (14%). Both genders felt their marriage had been over long before the decision to
divorce was made, with many of the middle-aged adults in the survey reporting that they stayed
together because they were still raising children. Females also indicated that they remained in
their marriage due to financial concerns, including the loss of health care (Sohn, 2015).
However, only 1 in 4 adults regretted their decision to divorce.
The effects of divorce are varied. Overall, young adults struggle more with the consequences of
divorce than do those at midlife, as they have a higher risk of depression or other signs of
problems with psychological adjustment (Birditt & Antonucci, 2013). Divorce at midlife is more
stressful for women. In the AARP (2009) survey, 44% of middle-aged women mentioned
financial problems after divorcing their spouse, in comparison only 11% of men reported such
difficulties. However, a number women who divorce in midlife report that they felt a great
release from their day-to-day sense of unhappiness. Hetherington and Kelly (2002) found that
among the divorce enhancers, those who had used the experience to better themselves and seek
more productive intimate relationships, and the competent loners, those who used their divorce
experience to grow emotionally, but who choose to stay single, the overwhelming majority were
women.
Dating Post-Divorce: Most divorced adults have dated by one year after filing for divorce
(Anderson et al., 2004; Anderson & Greene, 2011). One in four recent filers report having been
in or were currently in a serious relationship, and over half were in a serious relationship by one
year after filing for divorce. Not surprisingly, younger adults were more likely to be dating than
were middle aged or older adults, no doubt due to the larger pool of potential partners from
which they could to draw. Of course, these relationships will not all end in marriage. Teachman
(2008) found that more than two thirds of women under the age of 45 had cohabited with a
partner between their first and second marriages.
Dating for adults with children can be more of a challenge. Courtships are shorter in remarriage
than in first marriages. When couples are "dating", there is less going out and more time spent in
activities at home or with the children. So the couple gets less time together to focus on their
relationship. Anxiety or memories of past relationships can also get in the way. As one
Talmudic scholar suggests "when a divorced man marries a divorced woman, four go to bed."
(Secombe & Warner, 2004).
Post-divorce parents gatekeep, that is, they regulate the flow of information about their new
romantic partner to their children, in an attempt to balance their own needs for romance with
consideration regarding the needs and reactions of their children. Anderson et al. (2004) found
that almost half (47%) of dating parents gradually introduce their children to their dating partner,
giving both their romantic partner and children time to adjust and get to know each other. Many
parents who use this approach do so to avoid their children having to keep meeting someone new
until it becomes clearer that this relationship might be more than casual. It might also help if the
350

adult relationship is on firmer ground so it can weather any initial push back from children when
it is revealed. Forty percent are open and transparent about the new relationship at the outset with
their children. Thirteen percent do not reveal the relationship until it is clear that cohabitation
and or remarriage is likely. Anderson and colleagues suggest that practical matters influence
which gatekeeping method parents may use. Parents may be able to successfully shield their
children from a parade of suitors if there is reliable childcare available. The age and
temperament of the child, along with concerns about the reaction of the ex-spouse, may also
influence when parents reveal their romantic relationships to their children.
Rates of remarriage: The rate for remarriage, like the rate for marriage, has been declining
overall. In 2013 the remarriage rate was approximately 28 per 1,000 adults 18 and older. This
represents a 44% decline since 1990 and a 16% decline since 2008 (Payne, 2015). Brown and
Lin (2013) found that the rate of remarriage dropped more for younger adults than middle aged
and older adults, and Livingston (2014) found that as we age we are more likely to have
remarried (see Figure 8.35). This is not surprising as it takes some time to marry, divorce, and
then find someone else to marry. However, Livingston found that unlike those younger than 55,
those 55 and up are remarrying at a higher rate than in the past. In 2013, 67% of adults 55-64
and 50% of adults 65 and older had remarried, up from 55% and 34% in 1960, respectively.
Figure 8.35

Men have a higher rate of remarriage at every age
group starting at age 25 (Payne, 2015). Livingston
(2014) reported that in 2013, 64% of divorced or
widowed men compared with 52% of divorced or
widowed women had remarried. However, this gender
gap has narrowed over time. Even though more men
still remarry, they are remarrying at a slower rate. In
contrast, women are remarrying today more than they
did in 1980. This gender gap has closed mostly among
young and middle aged adults, but still persists among
those 65 and older.
In 2012, Whites who were previously married were
more likely to remarry than were other racial and ethnic
groups (Livingston, 2014). Moreover, the rate of
remarriage has increased among Whites, while the rate
of remarriage has declined for other racial and ethnic
groups. This increase is driven by White women, whose
rate of remarriage has increased, while the rate for
White males has declined.

Success of Remarriage: Reviews are mixed as to the happiness and success of remarriages.
While some remarriages are more successful, especially if the divorce motivated the adult to
engage in self-improvement and personal growth (Hetherington & Kelly, 2002), a number of
divorced adults end up in very similar marriages the second or third time around (Hetherington
& Kelly, 2002). Remarriages have challenges that are not found in first marriages that may
create additional stress in the marital relationship. There can often be a general lack of clarity in
family roles and expectations when trying to incorporate new kin into the family structure, even
determining the appropriate terms for these kin, along with their roles can be a challenge.
351

Partners may have to navigate carefully their role when dealing with their partners’ children. All
of this may lead to greater dissatisfaction and even resentment among family members. Even
though remarried couples tend to have more realistic expectations for marriage, they tend to be
less willing to stay in unhappy situations. The rate of divorce among remarriages is higher than
among first marriages (Payne, 2015), which can add additional burdens, especially when
children are involved.
Children’s Influence on Repartnering: Does having children affect whether a parent
remarries? Goldscheider and Sassler (2006) found children residing with their mothers reduces
the mothers’ likelihood of marriage, only with respect to marrying a man without children.
Further, having children in the home appears to increase single men’s likelihood of marrying a
woman with children (Stewart, Manning, & Smock, 2003). There is also some evidence that
individuals who participated in a stepfamily while growing up may feel better prepared for
stepfamily living as adults. Goldscheider and Kaufman (2006) found that having experienced
family divorce as a child is associated with a greater willingness to marry a partner with children.
When children are present after divorce, one of
the challenges the adults encounter is how
much influence the child will have when
selecting a new partner. Greene, Anderson,
Hetherington, Forgatch, and DeGarmo (2003)
identified two types of parents. The childfocused parent allows the child’s views,
reactions, and needs to influence the
repartnering. In contrast, the adult-focused
parent expects that their child can adapt and
should accommodate to parental wishes.
Anderson and Greene (2011) found that
divorced custodial mothers identified as more
Source
adult focused tended to be older, more
educated, employed, and more likely to have
been married longer. Additionally, adult focused mothers reported having less rapport with their
children, spent less time in joint activities with their children, and the child reported lower
rapport with their mothers. Lastly, when the child and partner were resisting one another, adultfocused mothers responded more to the concerns of the partner, while the child focused mothers
responded more to the concerns of the child. Understanding the implications of these two
differing perspectives can assist parents in their attempts to repartner.
Figure 8.36

Grandparents
In addition to maintaining relationships with their children and aging parents, many people in
middle adulthood take on yet another role, becoming a grandparent. The role of grandparent
varies around the world. In multigenerational households, grandparents may play a greater role
in the day-to-day activities of their grandchildren. While this family dynamic is more common
in Latin America, Asia, and Africa, it has been on the increase in the U.S. (Pew Research Center,
2010).

352

The degree of grandparent involvement
also depends on the proximity of the
grandparents’ home to the grandchildren.
In developed nations, the greater mobility
of the society can mean that grandparents
may live long distances from their
grandchildren. Technology has brought
grandparents and their more distant
grandchildren together. Sorenson and
Cooper (2010) found that many of the
grandfathers they interviewed would text,
email, or Skype with their grandchildren in
order to stay in touch.

Figure 8.37

Source

Cherlin and Furstenberg (1986) described three styles of grandparents. Thirty percent of
grandparents were remote as they rarely saw their grandchildren. Usually they lived far away
from the grandchildren but may also have had a distant relationship. Contact was typically made
on special occasions, such as holidays or birthdays. Fifty-five percent of grandparents were
described as companionate as they did things with their grandchildren but had little authority or
control over them. They preferred to spend time with them without interfering in parenting. They
were more like friends to their grandchildren. Fifteen percent of grandparents were described as
involved as they took a very active role in their grandchild’s life. The involved grandparent had
frequent contact with and authority over the grandchild, and their grandchildren might even have
lived with them. Grandmothers, more so than grandfathers, played this role. In contrast, more
grandfathers than grandmothers saw their role as family historian and family advisor (Neugarten
and Weinstein, 1964).
Bengtson (2001) suggests that grandparents adopt different styles with different grandchildren,
and over time may change styles as circumstances in the family change. Today more
grandparents are the sole care providers for grandchildren or may step in at times of crisis. With
these changes grandparents are redefining how they see their role in the family with fewer
adopting a more formal role (Hayslip, Henderson & Shore, 2003).
Early research on grandparents has routinely focused on grandmothers, with grandfathers often
becoming invisible members of the family (Sorensen & Cooper, 2010). Yet, grandfathers stress
the importance of their relationships with their grandchildren as strongly as do grandmothers
(Waldrop et al., 1999). For some men, this may provide them with the opportunity to engage in
activities that their occupations, as well as their generation’s views of fatherhood and
masculinity, kept them from engaging in with their own children (Sorenson & Cooper, 2010).
Many of the grandfathers in Sorenson and Cooper’s study felt that being a grandfather was easier
and a lot more enjoyable. Even among grandfathers that took on a more involved role, there was
still a greater sense that they could be more light-hearted and flexible in their interactions with
their grandchildren. Many grandfathers reported that they were more openly affectionate with
their grandchildren than they had been with their own children.
353

Friendships
Adults of all ages who reported having a confidante or close friend with whom they could share
personal feelings and concerns, believed these friends contributed to a sense of belonging,
security, and overall wellbeing (Dunér & Nordstrom, 2007). Having a close friend is a factor in
significantly lower odds of psychiatric morbidity including depression and anxiety (Harrison,
Barrow, Gask, & Creed, 1999; Newton et al., 2008). The availability of a close friend has also
been shown to lessen the adverse effects of stress on health (Kouzis & Eaton, 1998; Hawkley et
al., 2008; Tower & Kasl, 1995). Additionally, poor social connectedness in adulthood is
associated with a larger risk of premature mortality than cigarette smoking, obesity, and
excessive alcohol use (Holt-Lunstad, Smith, & Layton, 2010).
Female friendships and social
support networks at midlife
Figure 8.38
contribute significantly to a
woman’s feeling of life
satisfaction and well-being
(Borzumato-Gainey, Kennedy,
McCabe, & Degges-White,
2009). Degges-White and Myers
(2006) found that women who
have supportive people in their
life experience greater life
satisfaction than do those who
live a more solitary life. A
friendship network or the
Source
presence of a confidant have
both been identified for their importance to women's mental health (Baruch & Brooks-Gunn,
1984). Unfortunately, with numerous caretaking responsibilities at home, it may be difficult for
women to find time and energy to enhance the friendships that provide an increased sense of life
satisfaction (Borzumato-Gainey et al., 2009). Emslie, Hunt and Lyons (2013) found that for men
in midlife, the shared consumption of alcohol was important to creating and maintaining male
friends. Drinking with friends was justified as a way for men to talk to each other, provide social
support, relax, and improve mood. Although the social support provided when men drink
together can be helpful, the role of alcohol in male friendships can lead to health damaging
behavior from excessive drinking.
The importance of social relationships begins in early adulthood by laying down a foundation for
strong social connectedness and facilitating comfort with intimacy (Erikson, 1959). To
determine the impact of the quantity and quality of social relationships in young adulthood on
middle adulthood, Carmichael, Reis, and Duberstein (2015) assessed individuals at age 50 on
measures of social connection (types of relationships and friendship quality) and psychological
outcomes (loneliness, depression, psychological well-being). Results indicated that the quantity
of social interactions at age 20 and the quality, not quantity, of social interaction at age 30
predicted midlife social interactions. Those individuals who had high levels of social
information seeking (quantity) at age 20 followed by less quantity in social relationships but
greater emotional closeness (quality), resulted in positive psychosocial adjustment at midlife.
354

Continuing to socialize widely in one’s 30s appeared to negatively affect the development of
intimacy, and consequently resulted in worse psychological outcomes at age 50.
Internet Friendships: What influence does the Internet have on friendships? It is not surprising
that people use the Internet with the goal of meeting and making new friends (Fehr, 2008;
McKenna, 2008). Researchers have wondered if the issue of not being face-to-face reduces the
authenticity of relationships, or if the Internet really allows people to develop deep, meaningful
connections. Interestingly, research has demonstrated that virtual relationships are often as
intimate as in-person relationships; in fact, Bargh and colleagues found that online relationships
are sometimes more intimate (Bargh, McKenna, & Fitsimons, 2002). This can be especially true
for those individuals who are more socially anxious and lonely as such individuals are more
likely to turn to the Internet to find new and meaningful relationships (McKenna, Green, &
Gleason, 2002). McKenna and colleagues suggest that for people who have a hard time meeting
and maintaining relationships, due to shyness, anxiety, or lack of face-to-face social skills, the
Internet provides a safe, nonthreatening place to develop and maintain relationships. Similarly,
Benford (2008) found that for high-functioning autistic individuals, the Internet facilitated
communication and relationship development with others, which would have been more difficult
in face-to-face contexts, leading to the conclusion that Internet communication could be
empowering for those who feel frustrated when communicating face to face.
Workplace Friendships: Friendships often take root in the workplace, due to the fact that
people are spending as much, or more, time at work than they are with their family and friends
(Kaufman & Hotchkiss, 2003). Often, it is through these relationships that people receive
mentoring and obtain social support and resources, but they can also experience conflicts and the
potential for misinterpretation when sexual attraction is an issue. Indeed, Elsesser and Peplau
(2006) found that many workers reported that friendships grew out of collaborative work
projects, and these friendships made their days more pleasant.
In addition to those benefits,
Riordan and Griffeth (1995)
found that people who worked in
an environment where
friendships could develop and be
maintained were more likely to
report higher levels of job
satisfaction, job involvement,
and organizational commitment,
and they were less likely to leave
that job. Similarly, a Gallup poll
revealed that employees who had
close friends at work were almost
50% more satisfied with their
jobs than those who did not
(Armour, 2007).

Women in Midlife
In Western society, aging for women is much more stressful than for men as society emphasizes
youthful beauty and attractiveness (Slevin, 2010). The description that aging men are viewed as
“distinguished” and aging women are viewed as “old” is referred to as the double standard of
aging (Teuscher & Teuscher, 2006). Since women have traditionally been valued for their
reproductive capabilities, they may be considered old once they are postmenopausal. In contrast,
men have traditionally been valued for their achievements, competence and power, and therefore
are not considered old until they are physically unable to work (Carroll, 2016). Consequently,
women experience more fear, anxiety, and concern about their identity as they age, and may feel
pressure to prove themselves as productive and valuable members of society (Bromberger,
Kravitz, & Chang, 2013).
Attitudes about aging, however, do vary by race, culture, and sexual orientation. In some
cultures, aging women gain greater social status. For example, as Asian women age they attain
greater respect and have greater authority in the household (Fung, 2013). Compared to white
women, Black and Latina women possess less stereotypes about aging (Schuler et al., 2008).
Lesbians are also more positive about aging and looking older than heterosexual women (Slevin,
2010). The impact of media certainly plays a role in how women view aging by selling antiaging products and supporting cosmetic surgeries to look younger (Gilleard & Higgs, 2000).

Religion and Spirituality
Grzywacz and Keyes (2004) found that in addition to personal health behaviors, such as regular
exercise, healthy weight, and not smoking, social behaviors, including involvement in religiousrelated activities, have been shown to be positively related to optimal health. However, it is not
only those who are involved in a specific religion that
benefit, but so too do those identified as being spiritual.
Figure 8.40
According to Greenfield, Vaillant, and Marks (2009)
religiosity refers to engaging with a formal religious
group’s doctrines, values, traditions, and co-members. In
contrast, spirituality refers to an individual’s intrapsychic
sense of connection with something transcendent (that
which exists apart from and not limited by the material
universe) and the subsequent feelings of awe, gratitude,
compassion, and forgiveness. Research has demonstrated a
strong relationship between spirituality and psychological
well-being, irrespective of an individual’s religious
participation (Vaillant, 2008). Additionally, Sawatzky,
Ratner, & Chiu (2005) found that spirituality was related to
a higher quality of life for both individuals and societies.
Based on reports from the 2005 National Survey of Midlife
in the United States, Greenfield et al. (2009) found that
higher levels of spirituality were associated with lower
levels of negative affect and higher levels of positive affect,
356

Source

personal growth, purpose in life, positive relationships with others, self-acceptance,
environmental mastery, and autonomy. In contrast, formal religious participation was only
associated with higher levels of purpose in life and personal growth among just older adults and
lower levels of autonomy. In summary, it appears that formal religious participation and
spirituality relate differently to an individual’s overall psychological well-being.
Age: Older individuals identify religion/spirituality as being more important in their lives than
those younger (Beit-Hallahmi & Argyle, 1998). This age difference has been explained by
several factors including that religion and spirituality assist older individuals in coping with agerelated losses, provide opportunities for socialization and social support in later life, and
demonstrate a cohort effect in that older individuals were socialized more to be religious and
spiritual than those younger (Greenfield et al., 2009).
Gender: In the United States, women report identifying as being more religious and spiritual
than men do (de Vaus & McAllister, 1987). According to the Pew Research Center (2016),
women in the United States are more likely to say religion is very important in their lives than
men (60% vs. 47%). American women also are more likely than American men to say they pray
daily (64% vs. 47%) and attend religious services at least once a week (40% vs. 32%). Theories
to explain this gender difference include that women may benefit more from the social-relational
aspects of religion/spirituality because social relationships more strongly influence women’s
mental health. Additionally, women have been socialized to internalize the behaviors linked with
religious values, such as cooperation and nurturance, more than males (Greenfield et al., 2009).
Worldwide: To measure the religious beliefs
Figure 8.41
and practices of men and women around the
world, the Pew Research Center (2016)
conducted surveys of the general population in
84 countries between 2008 and 2015. Overall,
an estimated 83% of women worldwide
identified with a religion compared with 80% of
men. This equaled 97 million more women than
men identifying with a religion. There were no
countries in which men were more religious than
women by 2 percentage points or more. Among
Christians, women reported higher rates of
weekly church attendance and higher rates of
daily prayer. In contrast, Muslim women and
Source
Muslim men showed similar levels of religiousness, except frequency of attendance at worship
services. Because of religious norms, Muslim men worshiped at a mosque more often than
Muslim women. Similarly, Jewish men attended a synagogue more often than Jewish women. In
Orthodox Judaism, communal worship services cannot take place unless a minyan, or quorum of
at least 10 Jewish men, is present, thus insuring that men will have high rates of attendance.
Only in Israel, where roughly 22% of all Jewish adults self-identify as Orthodox, did a higher
percentage of men than women report engaging in daily prayer.

Chapter 9: Late Adulthood
Late adulthood spans the time when we reach our mid-sixties until death. This is the longest
developmental stage across the lifespan. In this chapter, we will consider the growth in numbers
for those in late adulthood, how that number is expected to change in the future, and the
implications this will bring to both the United States and worldwide. We will also examine
several theories of human aging, the physical, cognitive, and socioemotional changes that occur
with this population, and the vast diversity among those in this developmental stage. Further,
ageism and many of the myths associated with those in late adulthood will be explored.

Late Adulthood in America
Late adulthood, which includes those aged 65 years and above, is the fastest growing age
division of the United States population (Gatz, Smyer, & DiGilio, 2016). Currently, one in seven
Americans is 65 years of age or older. The first of the baby boomers (born from 1946-1964)
turned 65 in 2011, and approximately 10,000 baby boomers turn 65 every day. By the year
2050, almost one in four Americans will be over 65, and will be expected to live longer than
previous generations. According to the U. S. Census Bureau (2014b) a person who turned 65 in
2015 can expect to live another 19 years, which is 5.5 years longer than someone who turned 65
in 1950. This increasingly aged population has been referred to as the “Graying of America”.
This “graying” is already having significant effects on the nation in many areas, including work,
health care, housing, social security, caregiving, and adaptive technologies. Table 9.1 shows the
2012, 2020, and 2030 projected percentages of the U.S. population ages 65 and older.

The "Graying" of the World
Even though the United States is aging, it is still younger than most other developed countries
(Ortman, Velkoff, & Hogan, 2014). Germany, Italy, and Japan all had at least 20% of their
population aged 65 and over in 2012, and Japan had the highest percentage of elderly.
Additionally, between 2012 and 2050, the proportion aged 65 and over is projected to increase in
all developed countries. Japan is projected to continue to have the oldest population in 2030 and
2050. Table 9.2 shows the percentages of citizens aged 65 and older in select developed
countries in 2012 and projected for 2030 and 2050.

According to the National Institute on Aging (NIA,
2015b), there are 524 million people over 65
worldwide. This number is expected to increase from
8% to 16% of the global population by 2050. Between
2010 and 2050, the number of older people in less
developed countries is projected to increase more than
250%, compared with only a 71% increase in developed
countries. Declines in fertility and improvements in
longevity account for the percentage increase for those
65 years and older. In more developed countries,
fertility fell below the replacement rate of two live births
per woman by the 1970s, down from nearly three
children per woman around 1950. Fertility rates also fell
Source
in many less developed countries from an average of six
children in 1950 to an average of two or three children
in 2005. In 2006, fertility was at or below the two-child replacement level in 44 less developed
countries (NIA, 2015d).
Figure 9.1 Age is Increasing
Worldwide

In total number, the United States is projected to have a larger older population than the other
developed nations, but a smaller older population compared with China and India, the world’s
two most populous nations (Ortman et al., 2014). By 2050, China’s older population is projected
to grow larger than the total U.S. population today. As the population ages, concerns grow about
who will provide for those requiring long-term care. In 2000, there were about 10 people 85 and
older for every 100 persons between ages 50 and 64. These midlife adults are the most likely
care providers for their aging parents. The number of old requiring support from their children is
expected to more than double by the year 2040 (He, Sengupta, Velkoff, & DeBarros,
2005). These families will certainly need external physical, emotional, and financial support in
meeting this challenge.

Life Expectancy vs Lifespan
Lifespan or Maximum Lifespan is referred to as the greatest age reached by any member of a
given population (or species). For humans, the lifespan is currently between 120 and 125. Life
expectancy is defined as the average number of years that members of a population (or species)
live. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) (2019) global life expectancy for those
born in 2019 is 72.0 years, with females reaching 74.2 years and males reaching 69.8 years.
Women live longer than men around the world, and the gap between the sexes has remained the
same since 1990. Overall life expectancy ranges from 61.2 years in the WHO African Region to
77.5 years in the WHO European Region. Global life expectancy increased by 5.5 years between
2000 and 2016. Improvements in child survival and access to antiretroviral medication for the
treatment of HIV are considered factors for the increase. However, life expectancy in lowincome countries (62.7 years) is 18.1 years lower than in high-income countries (80.8 years). In
high-income countries, the majority of people who die are old, while in low-income countries
almost one in three deaths are in children under 5 years of age. According to the Central
Intelligence Agency (2019) the United States ranks 45th in the world for life expectancy.

World Healthy Life Expectancy: A better way to appreciate the diversity of people in late
adulthood is to go beyond chronological age and examine how well the person is aging. Many in
late adulthood enjoy better health and social well-being than average and would be aging at an
optimal level. In contrast, others experience poor health and dependence to a greater extent than
would be considered normal. When looking at large populations, the WHO (2019) measures
how many equivalent years of full health on average a newborn baby is expected to have. This
age takes into account current age-specific mortality, morbidity, and disability risks and is
referred to as The Healthy Life Expectancy. In 2016, the global Healthy Life Expectancy was
63.3 years up from 58.5 years in 2000. The WHO African Region had the lowest Healthy Life
Expectancy at 53.8 years, while the WHO Western Pacific Region had the highest at 68.9 years.
Life Expectancy in America: The overall life expectancy for a baby born in 2017 in the United
States is 78.6 years, decreasing from 78.7 years in 2016 and 78.8 years in 2015 (Arias & Xu,
2019). The decrease from 2016 occurred for males, changing from 76.2 years to 76.1 years,
while it did not change for females (81.1 years). Life expectancy at birth decreased by 0.1 year
for the non-Hispanic white population (78.6 to 78.5). Life expectancy at birth did not change
from 2016 for the non-Hispanic black population (74.9), and the Hispanic population (81.8).
Before this two-year decline, life expectancy had been increasing. Reasons given by the CDC
for this decrease in life expectancy include deaths from drug overdoses, an increase in liver
disease, and a rise in suicide rates (Saiidi, 2019). Figure 9.2 shows the United States life
expectancy from 2006-2017 by ethnicity and sex.

American Healthy Life Expectancy: To
determine the current United States
Healthy Life Expectancy (HLE), factors
were evaluated in 2007-2009 to determine
how long an individual currently at age 65
will continue to experience good health
(CDC, 2013). The highest Healthy Life
Expectancy (HLE) was observed in Hawaii
with 16.2 years of additional good health,
and the lowest was in Mississippi with only
10.8 years of additional good health.
Overall, the lowest HLE was among
southern states. Females had a greater
HLE than males at age 65 years in every
Source
state and DC. HLE was greater for whites
than for blacks in DC and all states from which data were available, except in Nevada and New
Mexico.
Figure 9.3

Although improvements have occurred in overall life expectancy, children born in America
today may be the first generation to have a shorter life span than their parents. Much of this
decline has been attributed to the increase in sedentary lifestyle and obesity. Since 1980, the
obesity rate for children between 2 and 19 years old has tripled, as 20.5% of children were obese
in 2014 compared with 5% in 1980 (American Medical Association, 2016). Obesity in children
is associated with many health problems, including high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, elevated
blood cholesterol levels, and psychological concerns including low self-esteem, negative body
image and depression. Excess weight is associated with an earlier risk of obesity-related
diseases and death. In 2007, former Surgeon General Richard Carmona stated, “Because of the
increasing rates of obesity, unhealthy eating habits and physical inactivity, we may see the first
generation that will be less healthy and have a shorter life expectancy than their parents” (p. 1).

Gender Differences in Life Expectancy
Biological Explanations: Biological differences in sex chromosomes and different pattern of
gene expression is theorized as one reason why females live longer (Chmielewski, Boryslawski,
& Strzelec, 2016). Males are heterogametic (XY), whereas females are homogametic (XX) with
respect to the sex chromosomes. Males can only express their X chromosome genes that come
from the mother, while females have an advantage by selecting the “better” X chromosome from
their mother or father, while inactivating the “worse” X chromosome. This process of selection
for “better” genes is impossible in males and results in the greater genetic and developmental
stability of females.
In terms of developmental biology, women are the “default” sex, which means that the creation
of a male individual requires a sequence of events at a molecular level. According to Chmilewski
et al. (2016):

375

These events are initiated by the activity of the SRY gene located on the Y chromosome.
This activity and change in the direction of development results in a greater number of
disturbances and developmental disorders, because the normal course of development
requires many different factors and mechanisms, each of which must work properly and
at a specific stage of the development. (p. 134)
Men are more likely to contract viral and bacterial infections, and their immunity at the cellular
level decreases significantly faster with age. Although women are slightly more prone to
autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, the gradual deterioration of
the immune system is slower in women (Caruso, Accardi, Virruso, & Candore, 2013; Hirokawa
et al., 2013).
Looking at the influence of hormones, estrogen levels in women appear to have a protective
effect on their heart and circulatory systems (Viña, Borrás, Gambini, Sastre, & Pallardó, 2005).
Estrogens also have antioxidant properties that protect against harmful effects of free radicals,
which damage cell components, cause mutations, and are in part responsible for the aging
process. Testosterone levels are higher in men than in women and are related to more frequent
cardiovascular and immune disorders. The level of testosterone is also responsible, in part, for
male behavioral patterns, including increased level of aggression and violence (Martin, Poon, &
Hagberg, 2011; Borysławski & Chmielewski, 2012). Another factor responsible for risky
behavior is the frontal lobe of the brain. The frontal lobe, which controls judgment and
consideration of an action’s consequences, develops more slowly in boys and young men. This
lack of judgment affects lifestyle choices, and consequently many more boys and men die by
smoking, excessive drinking, accidents, drunk driving, and violence (Shmerling, 2016).
Lifestyle Factors: Certainly not all the reasons
Figure 9.4 Men have more
women live longer than men are biological. As
dangerous jobs
previously mentioned, male behavioral patterns
and lifestyle play a significant role in the shorter
lifespans for males. One significant factor is that
males work in more dangerous jobs, including
police, fire fighters, and construction, and they
are more exposed to violence. According to the
Federal Bureau of Investigation (2014) there were
11,961 homicides in the U.S. in 2014 (last year
for full data) and of those 77% were males.
Males are also more than three times as likely to
commit suicide (CDC, 2016a). Further, males
serve in the military in much larger numbers than
Source
females. According to the Department of Defense
(2015), in 2014 83% of all officers in the Services
(Navy, Army, Marine Corps and Air Force) were male, while 85% of all enlisted service
members were male.

Relationship with a Doctor

Additionally, men are less likely than women to have
health insurance, develop a regular relationship with a
doctor, or seek treatment for a medical condition
(Scott, 2015). As mentioned in the middle adulthood
chapter, women are more religious than men, which is
associated with healthier behaviors (Greenfield,
Vaillant & Marks, 2009). Lastly, social contact is also
important as loneliness is considered a health hazard.
Nearly 20% of men over 50 have contact with their
friends less than once a month, compared to only 12%
of women who see friends that infrequently (Scott,
2015). Overall, men’s lower life expectancy appears
to be due to both biological and lifestyle factors.

Age Categories in Late Adulthood
There have been many ways to categorize the ages of individuals in late adulthood. In this
chapter, we will be dividing the stage into four categories: Young–old (65-74), old-old (75-84),
the oldest-old (85-99), and centenarians (100+) for comparison. These categories are based on
the conceptions of aging including, biological, psychological, social, and chronological
differences. They also reflect the increase in longevity of those living to this latter stage.
Young-old: Generally, this age span includes many
positive aspects and is considered the “golden years”
of adulthood. When compared to those who are older,
the young-old experience relatively good health and
social engagement (Smith, 2000), knowledge and
expertise (Singer, Verhaeghen, Ghisletta,
Lindenberger, & Baltes, 2003), and adaptive flexibility
in daily living (Riediger, Freund, & Baltes, 2005). The
young-old also show strong performance in attention,
memory, and crystallized intelligence. In fact, those
identified as young-old are more similar to those in
midlife. This group is less likely to require long-term
care, to be dependent or poor, and more likely to be
married, working for pleasure rather than income, and
living independently. Overall, those in this age period
feel a sense of happiness and emotional well-being that
Source
is better than at any other period of adulthood
(Carstensen, Fung, & Charles, 2003; George, 2009;
Robins & Trzesniewski, 2005). It is also an unusual age in that people are considered both in
old age and not in old age (Rubinstein, 2002).
Figure 9.6 Young-old experience
positive well-being

Old-old: Adults in this age period are likely to be living independently, but often experience
physical impairments as chronic diseases increase after age 75. For example, congestive heart
377

failure is 10 times more common in people 75 and older, than in younger adults (National
Library of Medicine, 2019). In fact, half of all cases of heart failure occur in people after age 75
(Strait & Lakatta, 2012). In addition, hypertension and cancer rates are also more common after
75, but because they are linked to lifestyle choices, they typically can be can prevented, lessoned,
or managed (Barnes, 2011b).
Oldest-old: This age group often includes people who have more serious chronic ailments
among the older adult population. In the U.S., the oldest-old represented 14% of the older adult
population in 2015 (He, Goodkind, & Kowal, 2016). This age group is one of the fastest growing
worldwide and is projected to increase more than 300% over its current levels (NIA, 2015b).
The oldest-old are projected to be nearly 18 million by 2050, or about 4.5% of the U. S.
population, compared with less than 2% of the population today. Females comprise more than
60% of those 85 and older, but they also suffer from more chronic illnesses and disabilities than
older males (Gatz et al., 2016).
While this age group accounts
for only 2% of the U. S.
population, it accounts for 9% of
60
all hospitalizations (Levant,
50
Chari & DeFrances, 2015). In a
study of over 64,000 patients age
40
65 and older who visited an

emergency department, the
20
admission rates increased with
age. Thirty-five% of admissions

were the old-old, and nearly half
were the oldest-old (Lee, Oh,
Admissions

Park, Choi, & Wee, 2018). The

mortality rate was also higher
with age. The most common
reasons for hospitalization for the oldest-old were congestive heart failure, pneumonia, urinary
tract infections, septicemia, stroke, and hip fractures. In recent years, hospitalizations for many
of these medical problems have been reduced. However, hospitalization for urinary tract
infections and septicemia has increased for those 85 and older Levant et al., 2015).
Figure 9.7 Percentage of Admissions and Death.

Those 85 and older are more likely to require long-term care and to be in nursing homes than the
youngest-old. Almost 50% of the oldest-old require some assistance with daily living activities
(APA, 2016). However, most still live in the community rather than a nursing home, as shown
in Figure 9.7 (Stepler, 2016b). The oldest-old are less likely to be married and living with a
spouse compared with the majority of the young-old (APA, 2016; Stepler, 2016c). As can be
seen, in Figure 9.8, gender is also an important factor in the likelihood of being married or living
with one’s spouse.

Centenarians: A segment of the oldest-old are centenarians, that is,
100 and older, and some are also referred to as supercentarians, those
110 and older (Wilcox, Wilcox & Ferrucci, 2008). In 2015 there
were nearly half a million centenarians worldwide, and it is estimated
that this age group will grow to almost 3.7 million by 2050. The U. S.
has the most centenarians, but Japan and Italy have the most per
capita (Stepler, 2016e). Most centenarians tended to be healthier than
many of their peers as they were growing older, and often there was a
delay in the onset of any serious disease or disability until their 90s.
Additionally, 25% reached 100 with no serious chronic illnesses, such
as depression, osteoporosis, heart disease, respiratory illness, or
dementia (Ash et al. 2015). Centenarians are more likely to
experience a rapid terminal decline in later life, meaning that for most
of their adulthood, and even older adult years, they are relatively
healthy in comparison to many other older adults (Ash et al., 2015;
Wilcox et al., 2008). According to Guinness World Records (2016),
Jeanne Louise Calment has been documented to be the longest living
person at 122 years and 164 days old (See Figure 9.9).

Theories of Aging
Why do we age? There are many theories that attempt to explain how we age, however,
researchers still do not fully understand what factors contribute to the human lifespan (Jin, 2010).
Research on aging is constantly evolving and includes a variety of studies involving genetics,
biochemistry, animal models, and human longitudinal studies (NIA, 2011a). According to Jin
(2010), modern biological theories of human aging involve two categories. The first is
Programmed Theories that follow a biological timetable, possibly a continuation of childhood
development. This timetable would depend on “changes in gene expression that affect the
systems responsible for maintenance, repair, and defense responses,” (p. 72). The second
category includes Damage or Error Theories which emphasize environmental factors that
cause cumulative damage in organisms. Examples from each of these categories will be
discussed.
Genetics: One’s genetic make-up certainly plays a
Figure 9.10
role in longevity, but scientists are still attempting
to identify which genes are responsible. Based on
animal models, some genes promote longer life,
while other genes limit longevity. Specifically,
longevity may be due to genes that better equip
someone to survive a disease. For others, some
genes may accelerate the rate of aging, while others
decrease the rate. To help determine which genes
promote longevity and how they operate,
researchers scan the entire genome and compare
Source
genetic variants in those who live longer with those
who have an average or shorter lifespan. For
example, a National Institutes of Health study identified genes possibly associated with blood fat
levels and cholesterol, both risk factors for coronary disease and early death (NIA, 2011a).

380

Researchers believe that it is most likely a combination of many genes that affect the rate of
aging.
Evolutionary Theory: Evolutionary psychology emphasizes the importance of natural selection;
that is, those genes that allow one to survive and reproduce will be more likely to be transmitted
to offspring. Genes associated with aging, such as Alzheimer Disease, do not appear until after
the individual has passed their main reproductive years. Consequently, natural selection has not
eliminated these damaging disorders from the gene pool. If these detrimental disorders occurred
earlier in the development cycle, they may have been eliminated already (Gems, 2014).
Cellular Clock Theory: This theory suggests that
Figure 9.11 Telomeres and
biological aging is due to the fact that normal cells
Cellular Senescence
cannot divide indefinitely. This is known as the
Hayflick limit, and is evidenced in cells studied in test
tubes, which divide about 40-60 times before they stop
(Bartlett, 2014). But what is the mechanism behind this
cellular senescence? At the end of each chromosomal
strand is a sequence of DNA that does not code for any
particular protein, but protects the rest of the
chromosome, which is called a telomere. With each
replication, the telomere gets shorter. Once it becomes
too short the cell does one of three things. It can stop
replicating by turning itself off, called cellular
senescence. It can stop replicating by dying, called
Adapted from National Institute on Aging
apoptosis. Or, as in the development of cancer, it can
continue to divide and become abnormal. Senescent
cells can also create problems. While they may be turned off, they are not dead, thus they still
interact with other cells in the body and can lead to an increase risk of disease. When we are
young, senescent cells may reduce our risk of serious diseases such as cancer, but as we age they
increase our risk of such problems (NIA, 2011a). Understanding why cellular senescence
changes from being beneficial to being detrimental is still under investigation. The answer may
lead to some important clues about the aging process.
DNA Damage: Over time DNA, which contains the genetic code for all organisms, accumulates
damage. This is usually not a concern as our cells are capable of repairing damage throughout
our life. Further, some damage is harmless. However, some damage cannot be repaired and
remains in our DNA. Scientists believe that this damage, and the body’s inability to fix itself, is
an important part of aging (NIA, 2011a). As DNA damage accumulates with increasing age, it
can cause cells to deteriorate and malfunction (Jin, 2010). Factors that can damage DNA include
ultraviolet radiation, cigarette smoking, and exposure to hydrocarbons, such as auto exhaust and
coal (Dollemore, 2006).
Mitochondrial Damage: Damage to mitochondrial DNA can lead to a decaying of the
mitochondria, which is a cell organelle that uses oxygen to produce energy from food. The
mitochondria convert oxygen to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) which provides the energy for the
cell. When damaged, mitochondria become less efficient and generate less energy for the cell
and can lead to cellular death (NIA, 2011a).
381

Free Radicals: When the mitochondria uses oxygen to
produce energy, they also produce potentially harmful
byproducts called oxygen free radicals (NIA, 2011a). The
free radicals are missing an electron and create instability
in surrounding molecules by taking electrons from them.
There is a snowball effect (A takes from B and then B takes
from C, etc.) that creates more free radicals which disrupt
the cell and causes it to behave abnormally (See Figure
9.11). Some free radicals are helpful as they can destroy
bacteria and other harmful organisms, but for the most part
they cause damage in our cells and tissue. Free radicals are
identified with disorders seen in those of advanced age,
including cancer, atherosclerosis, cataracts, and
neurodegeneration. Some research has supported adding
antioxidants to our diets to counter the effects of free radical
damage because the antioxidants can donate an electron that
can neutralize damaged molecules. However, the research
on the effectiveness of antioxidants is not conclusive
(Harvard School of Public Health, 2016).

Immune and Hormonal Stress Theories:
Ever notice how quickly U.S. presidents seem
to age? Before and after photos reveal how
stress can play a role in the aging process.
When gerontologists study stress, they are not
just considering major life events, such as
unemployment, death of a loved one, or the
birth of a child. They are also including
metabolic stress, the life sustaining activities
of the body, such as circulating the blood,
eliminating waste, controlling body
temperature, and neuronal firing in the brain.
In other words, all the activities that keep the
body alive also create biological stress.

To understand how this stress affects aging, researchers note that both problems with the innate
and adaptive immune system play a key role. The innate immune system is made up of the skin,
mucous membranes, cough reflex, stomach acid, and specialized cells that alert the body of an
impending threat. With age these cells lose their ability to communicate as effectively, making it
harder for the body to mobilize its defenses. The adaptive immune system includes the tonsils,
spleen, bone marrow, thymus, circulatory system and the lymphatic system that work to produce
and transport T cells. T-cells, or lymphocytes, fight bacteria, viruses, and other foreign threats to
the body. T-cells are in a “naïve” state before they are programmed to fight an invader and
become “memory cells”. These cells now remember how to fight a certain infection should the
382

body ever come across this invader again. Memory cells can remain in your body for many
decades, and why the measles vaccine you received as a child is still protecting you from this
virus today. As older adults produce fewer new T-cells to be programmed, they are less able to
fight off new threats and new vaccines work less effectively. The reason why the shingles
vaccine works well with older adults is because they already have some existing memory cells
against the varicella virus. The shingles vaccine is acting as a booster (NIA, 2011a).
Hormonal Stress Theory, also known as Neuroendocrine Theory of Aging, suggests that as
we age the ability of the hypothalamus to regulate hormones in the body begins to decline
leading to metabolic problems (American Federation of Aging Research (AFAR) 2011). This
decline is linked to excess of the stress hormone cortisol. While many of the body’s hormones
decrease with age, cortisol does not (NIH, 2014a). The more stress we experience, the more
cortisol released, and the more hypothalamic damage that occurs. Changes in hormones have
been linked to several metabolic and hormone related problems that increase with age, such as
diabetes (AFAR, 2011), thyroid problems (NIH, 2013), osteoporosis, and orthostatic hypotension
(NIH, 2014a).

Physical Changes of Aging
The Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging (BLSA) (NIA, 2011b) began in 1958 and has traced
the aging process in 1,400 people from age 20 to 90. Researchers from the BLSA have found
that the aging process varies significantly from individual to individual and from one organ
system to another. However, some key generalization can be made including:
• Heart muscles thicken with age
• Arteries become less flexible
• Lung capacity diminishes
• Kidneys become less efficient in removing waste from the blood
• Bladder loses its ability to store urine
• Brain cells also lose some functioning, but new neurons can also be produced.
Many of these changes are determined by genetics, lifestyle, and disease. Other changes in late
adulthood include:
Body Changes: Everyone’s body shape changes naturally as they age. According to the National
Library of Medicine (2014) after age 30 people tend to lose lean tissue, and some of the cells of
the muscles, liver, kidney, and other organs are lost. Tissue loss reduces the amount of water in
your body and bones may lose some of their minerals and become less dense (a condition called
osteopenia in the early stages and osteoporosis in the later stages). The amount of body fat goes
up steadily after age 30, and older individuals may have almost one third more fat compared to
when they were younger. Fat tissue builds up toward the center of the body, including around the
internal organs.
Skin, Hair and Nails: With age skin becomes thinner, less elastic, loses fat, and no longer looks
plump and smooth. Veins and bones can be seen easier, and scratches, cuts, and bumps can take
longer to heal. Years exposed to the sun may lead to wrinkles, dryness, age spots, and cancer.
Older people may bruise more easily, and it can take longer for these bruises to heal. Some
383

medicines or illnesses may also cause bruising. Gravity can cause skin to sag and wrinkle, and
smoking can wrinkle the skin. Also, seen in older adults are age spots, previously called “liver
spots”. They look like flat, brown spots and are often caused by years in the sun. Skin tags are
small, usually flesh-colored growths of skin that have a raised surface. They become common as
people age, especially for women, but both age spots and skin tags are harmless (NIA, 2015f).
Nearly everyone has hair loss as they age, and the rate
of hair growth slows down as many hair follicles stop
producing new hairs (U.S. National Library of
Medicine, 2019). The loss of pigment and subsequent
graying begun in middle adulthood continues in late
adulthood. The body and face also lose hair. Facial hair
may grow coarser. For women this often occurs around
the chin and above the upper lip. For men the hair of
the eyebrows, ears, and nose may grow longer. Nails,
particularly toenails, may become hard and thick.
Lengthwise ridges may develop in the fingernails and
toenails. However, pits, lines, changes in shape or color
should be checked by a healthcare provider as they can
be related to nutritional deficiencies or kidney disease
(U.S. National Library of Medicine).
Figure 9.15 Bone Growth Changes

Figure 9.14

Height and Weight: The tendency to become shorter as
one ages occurs among all races and both sexes. Height
loss is related to aging changes in the bones, muscles,
and joints. People typically lose almost one-half inch
every 10 years after age 40, and height loss is even
more rapid after age 70. A total of 1 to 3 inches in
height is lost with aging. Changes in body weight vary
for men and woman. Men often gain weight until about
age 55, and then begin to lose weight later in life,
possibly related to a drop in the male sex hormone
testosterone. Women usually gain weight until age 65,
and then begin to lose weight. Weight loss later in life
occurs partly because fat replaces lean muscle tissue,
and fat weighs less than muscle. Diet and exercise are
important factors in weight changes in late adulthood
(National Library of Medicine, 2014).

Sarcopenia is the loss of muscle tissue as a natural part
of aging. Sarcopenia is most noticeable in men, and
physically inactive people can lose as much as 3% to
Source
5% of their muscle mass each decade after age 30, but
even when active muscle loss still occurs (Webmd,
2016). Symptoms include a loss of stamina and weakness, which can decrease physical activity
and subsequently further shrink muscles. Sarcopenia typically happens faster around age 75, but
384

it may also speed up as early as 65 or as late as 80. Factors involved in sarcopenia include a
reduction in nerve cells responsible for sending signals to the muscles from the brain to begin
moving, a decrease in the ability to turn protein into energy, and not receiving enough calories or
protein to sustain adequate muscle mass. Any loss of muscle is important because it lessens
strength and mobility, and sarcopenia is a factor in frailty and the likelihood of falls and fractures
in older adults. Maintaining strong leg and heart muscles are important for
independence. Weight-lifting, walking, swimming, or engaging in other cardiovascular exercises
can help strengthen the muscles and prevent atrophy.

Sensory Changes in Late Adulthood
Vision: In late adulthood, all the senses show signs of decline, especially among the oldest-old.
In the last chapter, you read about the visual changes that were beginning in middle adulthood,
such as presbyopia, dry eyes, and problems seeing in dimmer light. By later adulthood these
changes are much more common. Three serious eyes diseases are more common in older adults:
Cataracts, macular degeneration, and glaucoma. Only the first can be effectively cured in most
people.
Cataracts are a clouding of the lens of the eye. The lens of the eye is made up of mostly water
and protein. The protein is precisely arranged to keep the lens clear, but with age some of the
protein starts to clump. As more of the protein clumps together the clarity of the lens is reduced.
While some adults in middle adulthood may show signs of cloudiness in the lens, the area
affected is usually small enough to not interfere with vision. More people have problems with
cataracts after age 60 (NIH, 2014b) and by age 75, 70% of adults will have problems with
cataracts (Boyd, 2014). Cataracts also cause a discoloration of the lens, tinting it more yellow
and then brown, which can interfere with the ability to distinguish colors such as black, brown,
dark blue, or dark purple.

Figure 9.16

Source

Risk factors besides age include certain health problems
such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and obesity,
behavioral factors such as smoking, other environmental
factors such as prolonged exposure to ultraviolet sunlight,
previous trauma to the eye, long-term use of steroid
medication, and a family history of cataracts (NEI, 2016a;
Boyd, 2014). Cataracts are treated by removing and
replacing the lens of the eye with a synthetic lens. In
developed countries, such as the United States, cataracts
can be easily treated with surgery. However, in
developing countries, access to such operations are limited,
making cataracts the leading cause of blindness in late
adulthood in the least developed countries (Resnikoff,
Pascolini, Mariotti & Pokharel, 2004). As shown in Figure
9.16, areas of the world with limited medical treatment for
cataracts often results in people living more years with a
serious disability. For example, of those living in the
385

darkest red color on the map, more than 990 out of 100,00 people have a shortened lifespan due
to the disability caused by cataracts.
Older adults are also more likely to develop age-related macular degeneration, which is the
loss of clarity in the center field of vision, due to the deterioration of the macula, the center of
the retina. Macular degeneration does not usually cause total vision loss, but the loss of the
central field of vision can greatly impair day-to-day functioning. There are two types of macular
degeneration: dry and wet. The dry type is the most common form and occurs when tiny pieces
of a fatty protein called drusen form beneath the retina. Eventually the macular becomes thinner
and stops working properly (Boyd, 2016). About 10% of people with macular degeneration have
the wet type, which causes more damage to their central field of vision than the dry form. This
form is caused by an abnormal development of blood vessels beneath the retina. These vessels
may leak fluid or blood causing more rapid loss of vision than the dry form.
The risk factors for macular degeneration include smoking, which doubles your risk (NIH,
2015a); race, as it is more common among Caucasians than African Americans or
Hispanics/Latinos; high cholesterol; and a family history of macular degeneration (Boyd, 2016).
At least 20 different genes have been related to this eye disease, but there is no simple genetic
test to determine your risk, despite claims by some genetic testing companies (NIH, 2015a). At
present, there is no effective treatment for the dry type of macular degeneration. Some research
suggests that certain patients may benefit from a cocktail of certain antioxidant vitamins and
minerals, but the results are mixed at best. They are not a cure for the disease nor will they
restore the vision that has been lost. This “cocktail” can slow the progression of visual loss in
some people (Boyd, 2016; NIH, 2015a). For the wet type medications that slow the growth of
abnormal blood vessels, and surgery, such as laser treatment to destroy the abnormal blood
vessels may be used. Only 25% of those with the wet version may see improvement with these
procedures (Boyd, 2016).
A third vision problem that increases with
age is glaucoma, which is the loss of
peripheral vision, frequently due to a
buildup of fluid in eye that damages the
optic nerve. As you age the pressure in
the eye may increase causing damage to
the optic nerve. The exterior of the optic
nerve receives input from retinal cells on
the periphery, and as glaucoma
progresses more and more of the
peripheral visual field deteriorates toward
the central field of vision. In the
advanced stages of glaucoma, a person
can lose their sight. Fortunately,
glaucoma tends to progresses slowly
(NEI, 2016b).

Macular Degeneration and Glaucoma

Glaucoma is the most common cause of
blindness in the U.S. (NEI, 2016b).
African Americans over age 40, and everyone else over age 60 has a higher risk for glaucoma.
386

Those with diabetes, and with a family history of glaucoma also have a higher risk (Owsley et
al., 2015). There is no cure for glaucoma, but its rate of progression can be slowed, especially
with early diagnosis. Routine eye exams to measure eye pressure and examination of the optic
nerve can detect both the risk and presence of glaucoma (NEI, 2016b). Those with elevated eye
pressure are given medicated eye drops. Reducing eye pressure lowers the risk of developing
glaucoma or slow its progression in those who already have it.
Hearing: As you read in Chapter 8, our hearing declines both in terms of the frequencies of
sound we can detect, and the intensity of sound needed to hear as we age. These changes
continue in late adulthood. Almost 1 in 4 adults aged 65 to 74 and 1 in 2 aged 75 and older have
disabling hearing loss (NIH, 2016). Table 9.4 lists some common signs of hearing loss.
Presbycusis is a common form of hearing
loss in late adulthood that results in a
gradual loss of hearing. It runs in families
and affects hearing in both ears (NIA,
2015c). Older adults may also notice
tinnitus, a ringing, hissing, or roaring
sound in the ears. The exact cause of
tinnitus is unknown, although it can be
related to hypertension and allergies. It
may come and go or persist and get worse
over time (NIA, 2015c). The incidence of
both presbycusis and tinnitus increase with
age and males have higher rates of both
around the world (McCormak,
Edmondson-Jones, Somerset, & Hall,
2016).

balance. Your balance is controlled by the
brain receiving information from the
shifting of hair cells in the inner ear about the position and orientation of the body. With age this
function of the inner ear declines which can lead to problems with balance when sitting,
standing, or moving (Martin, 2014).
Taste and Smell: Our sense of
taste and smell are part of our
chemical sensing system. Our
sense of taste, or gustation,
appears to age well. Normal taste
occurs when molecules that are
released by chewing food
stimulate taste buds along the
tongue, the roof of the mouth,
and in the lining of the throat.
These cells send messages to the

brain, where specific tastes are identified. After age 50 we start to lose some of these sensory
cells. Most people do not notice any changes in taste until ones 60s (NIH: Senior Health, 2016b).
Given that the loss of taste buds is very gradual, even in late adulthood, many people are often
surprised that their loss of taste is most likely the result of a loss of smell.
Our sense of smell, or olfaction, decreases more with age, and problems with the sense of smell
are more common in men than in women. Almost 1 in 4 males in their 60s have a disorder with
the sense of smell, while only 1 in 10 women do (NIH: Senior Health, 2016b). This loss of smell
due to aging is called presbyosmia. Olfactory cells are located in a small area high in the nasal
cavity. These cells are stimulated by two pathways; when we inhale through the nose, or via the
connection between the nose and the throat when we chew and digest food. It is a problem with
this second pathway that explains why some foods such as chocolate or coffee seem tasteless
when we have a head cold. There are several types of loss of smell. Total loss of smell, or
anosmia, is extremely rare.
Problems with our chemical senses can be linked to other serious medical conditions such as
Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, or multiple sclerosis (NIH: Senior Health, 2016a). Any sudden
change should be checked out. Loss of smell can change a person’s diet, with either a loss of
enjoyment of food and eating too little for balanced nutrition or adding sugar and salt to foods
that are becoming blander to the palette.
Touch: Research has found that with age, people may experience reduced or changed sensations
of vibration, cold, heat, pressure, or pain (Martin, 2014). Many of these changes are also aligned
with a number of medical conditions that are more common among the elderly, such as diabetes.
However, there are changes in the touch sensations among healthy older adults. The ability to
detect changes in pressure have been shown to decline with age, with it being more pronounced
by the 6th decade and diminishing further with advanced age (Bowden & McNelty, 2013). Yet,
there is considerable variability, with almost 40% showing sensitivity that is comparable to
younger adults (Thornbury & Mistretta, 1981). However, the ability to detect the
roughness/smoothness or hardness/softness of an object shows no appreciable change with age
(Bowden & McNulty, 2013). Those who show increasing insensitivity to pressure, temperature,
or pain are at risk for injury (Martin, 2014).
Pain: According to Molton and Terrill (2014), approximately
60%-75% of people over the age of 65 report at least some
chronic pain, and this rate is even higher for those individuals
living in nursing homes. Although the presence of pain
increases with age, older adults are less sensitive to pain than
younger adults (Harkins, Price, & Martinelli, 1986). Farrell
(2012) looked at research studies that included neuroimaging
techniques involving older people who were healthy and those
who experienced a painful disorder. Results indicated that there
were age-related decreases in brain volume in those structures
involved in pain. Especially noteworthy were changes in the
prefrontal cortex, brainstem, and hippocampus. Women are
more likely to identify feeling pain than men (Tsang et al.,
2008). Women have fewer opioid receptors in the brain, and
women also receive less relief from opiate drugs (Garrett, 2015).

Because pain serves an important indicator that there is something wrong, a decreased sensitivity
to pain in older adults is a concern because it can conceal illnesses or injuries requiring medical
attention.
Chronic health problems, including arthritis, cancer, diabetes, joint pain, sciatica, and shingles
are responsible for most of the pain felt by older adults (Molton & Terrill, 2014). Cancer is a
special concern, especially “breakthrough pain” which is a severe pain that comes on quickly
while a patient is already medicated with a long-acting painkiller. It can be very upsetting, and
after one attack many people worry it will happen again. Some older individuals worry about
developing an addiction to pain medication, but if medicine is taken exactly as prescribed,
addiction should not be a concern (NIH, 2015b). Lastly, side effects from pain medicine
including constipation, dry mouth, and drowsiness may occur that can adversely affect the
elder’s life.
Some older individuals put off going to the doctor because they think pain is just part of aging
and nothing can help. Of course, this is not true. Managing pain is crucial to ensure feelings of
well-being for the older adult. When chronic pain is not managed, the individual will restrict
their movements for fear of feeling pain or injuring themselves further. This lack of activity will
result in more restriction, further decreased participation, and greater disability (Jensen, Moore,
Bockow, Ehde, & Engel, 2011). A decline in physical activity because of pain is also associated
with weight gain and obesity in adults (Strine, Hootman, Chapman, Okoro, & Balluz, 2005).
Additionally, sleep and mood disorders, such as depression, can also occur (Moton & Terrill,
2014). Learning to cope effectively with pain is an important consideration in late adulthood and
working with one’s primary physician or a pain specialist is recommended (NIH, 2015b).
For those 65 and older, 35% have a disability of some type. Figure 9.19 identifies the percentage
of those who have a disability based on the type.

Nutrition
A healthy diet is necessary for older adults to
increase mental acuteness, resistance to
illness and disease, boost energy levels,
improve immune system strength,
recuperation speed, and have greater
effectiveness in the management of chronic
health problems (Mayer, 2016). The new
MyPlate for Older Adults, a website from
Tufts University, suggests that older adults
should strive for 50% of their diet being
fruits and vegetables; 25% grains, many of
which should be whole grains; and 25%
protein-rich foods, such as nuts, beans, fish,
lean meat, poultry, and fat-free and low-fat

dairy products such as milk, cheeses, and yogurts. Unfortunately, changes in sensory functions,
such as smell and taste, along with loss of teeth, can derail an older adult’s ability to eat right.
Older adults are likely to use salt and sugar to flavor foods that no longer taste the way they once
did. Several government websites provide older adults with alternatives to the salt shaker to
make foods more palatable.

Cancer and Major Cardiovascular Disease: As discussed in chapter 8, cancer and
cardiovascular disease are the overall leading causes of death, and they are especially high
reasons for death in middle and late adults. Table 9.7 identifies the percentages of deaths due to

coronary artery diseases, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, renal
insufficiency, cerebrovascular diseases, neurovascular complications of diabetes mellitus, and
arthritis that restricts mobility (Balducci & Extermann, 2000). Comorbidity will complicate
treatment.
Table 9.6 Death Percentages for Cancer and Heart Disease for
Selected Age Groups

Balducci and Extermann (2000) examined several concerns of cancer treatment in the elderly.
With aging, there is a decline in multiple organ systems that can adversely affect the ability of
medications to treat the cancer. Chemotherapy has been found to compromise the cognitive
function of those being treated for cancer, and it may further exacerbate dementia and elderly
cognitive declines. Frail individuals, defined as having limited life expectancy and near-toexhausted functional reserves, are also not considered candidates for more toxic forms of
chemotherapy. With cancer, the prevalence and risk of malnutrition are higher, and diminished
visual and hearing function makes elderly cancer patients more susceptible to environmental
injury. Screening for depression is also recommended because depression is associated with
weight loss, failure to thrive, and may reduce the motivation to receive treatment. Consequently,
depression has been associated with decreased survival rates in the elderly. Due to the projected
increase in the total number of older patients with cancer, it is recommended that physicians and
caretakers have expertise in both oncology and geriatrics (Berger et al., 2006).
Heart Disease: There are changes to the heart that happen with age, and some may increase a
person’s risk of heart disease. These include stiffening blood vessels and valves, which may
result in leaks or problems pumping blood out of the heart (NIA, 2012). As previously stated,
heart disease is the leading cause of death for those in late adulthood (CDC, 2016b). There are
different types of heart disease, and as already discussed in chapter 8, the most common is
atherosclerosis, the buildup of fatty deposits or plaques in the walls of arteries. As plaque builds
up, blood is unable to flow normally and bring oxygen throughout the body, including to the
391

heart. Depending on where the buildup is, atherosclerosis can cause a heart attack, leg pain, or a
stroke. However, Atherosclerosis is not part of normal aging. Many of the problems older
people have with their heart and blood vessels are caused by disease and not by aging. For
example, an older heart can normally pump blood as strong as a younger heart, while less ability
to pump blood is caused by disease. Therefore, leading a heart-healthy lifestyle is most important
to keeping one’s heart strong in late adulthood.
Arthritis: Arthritis and other rheumatic conditions are the most common cause of disability
among US adults and have been the most common cause of disability among US adults for the
past 15 years (NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases,
2014). According to the NIH, approximately 62% of adults with arthritis are 65 years old and up.
Almost 1 in 2 older adults with arthritis have some degree of mobility limitations, such as
climbing stairs, walking, and grasping objects. The pain and other limitations of arthritis can
also increase the risk of depression and other forms of mental distress. Osteoarthritis is the most
common type of arthritis. “When the cartilage, the slick, cushioning surface on the ends of bones
wears away, bone rubs against bone, causing pain, swelling and stiffness. Over time, joints can
lose strength and pain may become chronic” (Arthritis Foundation, 2017, para 3). Common risk
factors for osteoarthritis include genetics, obesity, age, previous injury, and other medical
conditions.

Osteoporosis

Osteoporosis and Kyphosis: Osteoporosis is a disease that thins and
weakens bones to the point that they become fragile and break easily.
After age 50, 1 in 2 women and 1 in 4 men will experience an
osteoporosis related fracture in their lifetime, often leading to hip, spine,
and wrist fractures (Dailey & Cravedi, 2006). Broken hips are a very
serious problem as we age. They greatly increase the risk of death,
especially during the year after they break (NIH Senior Health, 2015). In
the U.S., more than 53 million adults either already have osteoporosis or
at a high risk due to low bone mass (NIH Senior Health, 2015). As bones
weaken in the spine, adults gradually lose height and their posture
becomes hunched over, which is called Kyphosis. Over time a bent spine
can make it hard to walk or even sit up. Adults can prevent the loss of
bone mass by eating a healthy diet with enough calcium and vitamin D,
regularly exercising, limiting alcohol, and not smoking (National
Osteoporosis Foundation, 2016).

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive lung disease in which the
airways become damaged making it difficult to breathe. COPD includes problems such as
emphysema and chronic bronchitis (NIH Senior Health, 2013). COPD kills more than 120,000
people every year, making it one of the leading causes of death. COPD was once considered a
“man’s disease”. However, since 2000, 58% of those with COPD are women and they comprise
8% of all women (American Lung Association, 2019). Research has indicated that women may
be more susceptible to the effects of cigarette smoke due to having smaller lungs and estrogen
worsening the effects.

damaged lungs due to COPD. As
COPD develops slowly, people may
not notice the early signs, and may
attribute the shortness of breath to
age or lack of physical exercise. Most
people are not diagnosed until
midlife or late adulthood. There is no
cure as the damage cannot be
reversed. Treatments aim at slowing
further damage. Cigarette smoking is
the leading cause of COPD, but other
types of tobacco smoking, such as a
pipe or cigar, can cause COPD,
especially if the smoke is inhaled.
Heavy or long-term exposure to
second hand smoke can also lead to
COPD (NIH Senior Health, 2013).
Source
COPD can also occur in people who
have long term exposure to other environmental irritants, such as chemical fumes, and dust from
the environment and workplace.
About 1 in every 1,600 to 5,000 people have a risk for COPD because of a recessive genetic
condition known as alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency (NIH, 2011). AAT is a protein made
in the liver that protects organs, especially the lungs, from the effects of other harmful proteins.
In those with the genetic defect, the AAT protein created is the wrong shape and cannot leave the
liver. This can lead to a heightened risk for lung disease, and even liver disease, as the excess of
the AAT protein can lead to cirrhosis, which is a disease in which the liver becomes scarred and
does not function properly. While some people with ATT deficiency are not affected and live a
normal life, COPD is more likely to occur in such individuals if their lungs are exposed to
environmental irritants.
Shingles: According to the National Institute on Aging (2015e), shingles is a disease that
affects your nerves. Shingles is caused by the same virus as chicken pox, the varicella-zoster
virus (VZV). After you recover from chickenpox, the virus continues to live in some of your
nerve cells. It is usually inactive, and most adults live with VZV in their body and never get
shingles. However, the virus will become active in one in three adults. Instead of causing
chickenpox again, it produces shingles. A risk factor for shingles includes advanced age as
people have a harder time fighting off infections as they get older. About half of all shingles
cases are in adults age 60 or older, and the chance of getting shingles becomes much greater by
age 70. Other factors that weaken an individual’s ability to fight infections, such as cancer, HIV
infections, or other medical conditions, can put one at a greater risk for developing shingles.
Shingles results in pain, burning, tingling, or itching in the affected area, as well as a rash and
blisters. Typically, shingles develops only on one side of the body or face and in a small area
rather than all over. Most cases of shingles last 3 to 5 weeks. After the shingles rash goes away,
393

some people may be left with ongoing pain, called
post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) in the area where the
rash had been (NIA, 2015e). The older one is when
getting shingles, the greater the chance of developing
PHN. Some people with PHN find it hard to go about
their daily activities, like dressing, cooking, and
eating. They can also suffer from depression, anxiety
and sleeplessness. Medicines can help with pain and
usually PHN will disappear. Unfortunately, the
blisters from shingles may become infected or leave a
scar. Blisters near or in the eye can cause lasting eye
damage or blindness. A brief paralysis of the face,
hearing loss, and very rarely, swelling of the brain
Source
(encephalitis) can also occur. There is a shingles
vaccine that is recommended for those aged 50 and
older. Shingles is not contagious, but one can catch chickenpox from someone with shingles.
Figure 9.23 Shingles Rash

Beliefs about Health: Despite the fact that the majority of older adults have at least one chronic
illness, most rate their overall health positively (Graham, 2019). Based on results of the CDC’s
2017 National Health Interview Survey, 82% of those aged 65-74 and 73% of those 75 and older
rated their health as excellent, very good or good. Because older adults focus more on emotional
well-being, positive social relationships, remaining active, and overall life satisfaction, poor
physical functioning is not considered as important. Older adults often look to those who are
worse off than themselves, including those having died or are in a nursing home, and
consequently feel more positive about themselves. This perspective is in contrast to those
younger who believe that there should not be anything wrong with them, and consequently
experience negative feelings when they have an illness. Older adults expect there will be some
deterioration in their health and are able to adapt to it. Similarly, most older adults identify
positive mental health in conjunction with their physical health.

Brain Functioning
Research has demonstrated that the brain loses 5% to 10% of its weight between 20 and 90 years
of age (Fjell & Walhovd, 2010). This decrease in brain volume appears to be due to the
shrinkage of neurons, lower number of synapses, and shorter length of axons. According to
Garrett (2015), the normal decline in cognitive ability throughout the lifespan has been
associated with brain changes, including reduced activity of genes involved in memory storage,
synaptic pruning, plasticity, and glutamate and GABA (neurotransmitters) receptors. There is
also a loss in white matter connections between brain areas. Without myelin, neurons
demonstrate slower conduction and impede each other’s actions. A loss of synapses occurs in
specific brain areas, including the hippocampus (involved in memory) and the basal forebrain
region. Older individuals also activate larger regions of their attentional and executive networks,
located in the parietal and prefrontal cortex, when they perform complex tasks. This increased
activation correlates with a reduced performance on both executive tasks and tests of working
memory when compared to those younger (Kolb & Whishaw, 2011).

394

Continued Neurogenesis: Researchers at the University of Chicago found that new neurons
continued to form into old age. Tobin et al. (2019) examined post-mortem brain tissue of
individuals between the ages of 79 and 99 (average age 90.6) and found evidence of
neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Approximately 2000 neural progenitor cells and 150, 000
developing neurons were found per brain, although the number of developing neurons was lower
in people with cognitive impairments or Alzheimer’s disease. Tobin et al. hypothesized that the
lower levels of neurogenesis in the hippocampus were associated with symptoms of cognitive
decline and reduced synaptic plasticity.
The brain in late adulthood also exhibits considerable plasticity, and through practice and
training, the brain can be modified to compensate for any age-related changes (Erber &
Szuchman, 2015). Park and Reuter-Lorenz (2009) proposed the Scaffolding Theory of Aging
and Cognition which states that the brain adapts to neural atrophy (dying of brain cells) by
building alternative connections, referred to as scaffolding. This scaffolding allows older brains
to retain high levels of performance. Brain compensation is especially noted in the additional
neural effort demonstrated by those individuals who are aging well. For example, older adults
who performed just as well as younger adults on a memory task used both prefrontal areas, while
only the right prefrontal cortex was used in younger participants (Cabeza, Anderson, Locantore,
& McIntosh, 2002). Consequently, this decrease in brain lateralization appears to assist older
adults with their cognitive skills.
Healthy Brain Functioning: Cheng (2016) found that
physical activity and stimulating cognitive activity resulted in
significant reductions in the risk of neurocognitive disorders in
longitudinal studies. Physical activity, especially aerobic
exercise, is associated with less age-related gray and white
matter loss, as well and diminished neurotoxins in the brain.
Overall, physical activity preserves the integrity of neurons
and brain volume. Cognitive training improves the efficiency
of the prefrontal cortex and executive functions, such as
working memory, and strengthens the plasticity of neural
circuits. Both activities support cognitive reserve, or “the
structural and dynamic capacities of the brain that buffer
against atrophies and lesions” (p. 85). Although it is optimal
to begin physical and cognitive activities earlier in life, it is not
too late to start these programs in late adulthood to improve
one’s cognitive health.

Figure 9.24 Exercise is
Important to Brain
Functioning

Can we improve brain functioning? Many training programs
have been created to improve brain functioning. ACTIVE
Source
(Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital
Elderly), a study conducted between 1999 and 2001 in which
2,802 individuals age 65 to 94, suggests that the answer is "yes". These racially diverse
participants received 10 group training sessions and 4 follow up sessions to work on tasks of
memory, reasoning, and speed of processing. These mental workouts improved cognitive
functioning even 5 years later. Many of the participants believed that this improvement could be
395

seen in everyday tasks as well (Tennstedt et al., 2006). However, programs for the elderly on
memory, reading, and processing speed training demonstrate that there is improvement on the
specific tasks trained, but there is no generalization to other abilities (Jarrett, 2015). Further,
these programs have not been shown to delay or slow the progression of Alzheimer’s disease.
Although these programs are not harmful, “physical exercise, learning new skills, and socializing
remain the most effective ways to train your brain” (p. 207). These activities appear to build a
reserve to minimize the effects of primary aging of the brain.
Parkinson’s disease is characterized by motor tremors, loss of balance, poor coordination,
rigidity, and difficulty moving (Garrett, 2015). Parkinson’s affects approximately 1% of those
over the age of 60, and it appears more frequently in family members in a little less than 10%
of cases. Twenty-eight chromosomal areas have been implicated in Parkinson’s disease, but
environmental factors have also been identified and include brain injury. Being knocked
unconscious once increases the risk by 32% and being knocked out several times increases the
risk by 174% (Garrett, 2015). Other environmental influences include toxins, industrial
chemicals, carbon monoxide, herbicides and pesticides (Olanow & Tatton, 1999). The
symptoms are due to the deterioration of the substantia nigra, an area in the midbrain whose
neurons send dopamine-releasing axons to the basal ganglia which affects motor activity.
Treatment typically includes the medication levodopa (L-dopa), which crosses the blood-brain
barrier and is converted into dopamine in the brain. Deep brain stimulation, which involves
inserting an electrode into the brain that provides electrical stimulation, has resulted in
improved motor functioning (Garrett, 2015).

Sleep
Similar to other adults, older adults need between 7 to 9 hours of sleep per night, but they tend to
go to sleep earlier and get up earlier than those younger. This pattern is called advanced sleep
phase syndrome and is based on changes in circadian rhythms (National Sleep Foundation,
2009). There are sleep problems in older adults, and insomnia is the most common problem in
those 60 and older (NIA, 2016). People with insomnia have trouble falling asleep and staying
asleep. There are many reasons why older people may have insomnia, including certain
medications, being in pain, having a medical or psychiatric condition, and even worrying before
bedtime about not being able to sleep. Using over the counter sleep aids or medication may only
work when used for a short time. Consequently, sleep problems should be discussed with a
health care professional.
Also, common in older adults are sleep disorders, including sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome,
periodic limb movement disorder, and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (NIA, 2016).
Sleep apnea refers to repeated short pauses in breathing, while an individual sleeps, that can
lead to reduced oxygen in the blood. Snoring is a common symptom of sleep apnea and it often
worsens with age. Untreated sleep apnea can lead to impaired daytime functioning, high blood
pressure, headaches, stroke, and memory loss. Restless legs syndrome feels like there is
tingling, crawling, or pins and needles in one or both legs, and this feeling is worse at night.
Periodic limb movement disorder causes people to jerk and kick their legs every 20 to 40
seconds during sleep. Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder occurs when one’s
muscles can move during REM sleep and sleep is disrupted.
396

According to the National Sleep Foundation (2009), there are many medical conditions that
affect sleep and include gastroesophageal reflux disease, diabetes mellitus, renal failure,
respiratory diseases such as asthma, and immune disorders. Diseases such as Parkinson's disease
and multiple sclerosis also commonly cause problems sleeping. Lastly, Alzheimer’s disease can
interfere with sleeping patterns. Individuals may wake up many times during the night, wander
when up, and yell which can alter the amount of time they sleep. Both minor and major sleep
problems in older adults can lead to increased risk of accidents, falls, chronic fatigue, decreased
quality of life, cognitive decline, reduced immune function, and depression (Buman, 2013).
Figure 9.25 Exercise
Improves Sleep

Source

Because of sleep problems experienced by those in late
adulthood, research has looked into whether exercise can
improve their quality of sleep. Results show that 150
minutes per week of exercise can improve sleep quality
(Buman, 2013). This amount of exercise is also
recommended to improve other health areas including
lowering the risk for heart disease, diabetes, and some
cancers. Aerobic activity, weight training, and balance
programs are all recommended. For those who live in
assisted living facilities even light exercise, such as
stretching and short walks, can improve sleep. High intensity
activity is not necessary to see improvements. Overall, the
effects of exercise on sleep may actually be even larger for
older adults since their sleep quality may not be ideal to
start.

Sexuality
According to Kane (2008), older men and women are often
viewed as genderless and asexual. There is a stereotype that
elderly individuals no longer engage in sexual activity and
when they do, they are perceived to have committed some
kind of offense. These ageist myths can become
internalized, and older people have a more difficult time
accepting their sexuality (Gosney, 2011). Additionally,
some older women indicate that they no longer worry about
sexual concerns anymore once they are past the child
bearing years.

Figure 9.26

In reality, many older couples find greater satisfaction in
their sex life than they did when they were younger. They
Source
have fewer distractions, more time and privacy, no worries
about getting pregnant, and greater intimacy with a lifelong partner (NIA, 2013). Results from
the National Social Life Health, and Aging Project indicated that 72% of men and 45.5% of
women aged 52 to 72 reported being sexually active (Karraker, DeLamater, & Schwarz, 2011).
Additionally, the National Survey of Sexual Health data indicated that 20%-30% of individuals
remain sexually active well into their 80s (Schick et al., 2010). However, there are issues that
occur in older adults that can adversely affect their enjoyment of healthy sexual relationships.
397

Causes of Sexual Problems: According to the National Institute on Aging (2013), chronic
illnesses including arthritis (joint pain), diabetes (erectile dysfunction), heart disease (difficulty
achieving orgasm for both sexes), stroke (paralysis), and dementia (inappropriate sexual
behavior) can all adversely affect sexual functioning. Hormonal changes, physical disabilities,
surgeries, and medicines can also affect a senior’s ability to participate in and enjoy sex. How
one feels about sex can also affect performance. For example, a woman who is unhappy about
her appearance as she ages may think her partner will no longer find her attractive. A focus on
youthful physical beauty for women may get in the way of her enjoyment of sex. Likewise, most
men have a problem with erectile dysfunction (ED) once in a while, and some may fear that ED
will become a more common problem as they age. If there is a decline in sexual activity for a
heterosexual couple, it is typically due to a decline in the male’s physical health (Erber &
Szuchman, 2015).
Overall, the best way to experience a healthy sex life in later life is to keep sexually active while
aging. However, the lack of an available partner can affect heterosexual women’s participation
in a sexual relationship. Beginning at age 40 there are more women than men in the population,
and the ratio becomes 2 to 1 at age 85 (Karraker et al., 2011). Because older men tend to pair
with younger women when they become widowed or divorced, this also decreases the pool of
available men for older women (Erber & Szuchman, 2015). In fact, a change in marital status
does not result in a decline in the sexual behavior of men aged 57 to 85 years-old, but it does
result in a decline for similar aged women (Karraker et al., 2011).
Concluding Thoughts: Key players in improving the quality of life among older adults will
be those adults themselves. By exercising, reducing stress, stopping smoking, limiting use of
alcohol, and consuming more fruits and vegetables, older adults can expect to live longer
and more active lives (He et al., 2005). Stress reduction, both in late adulthood and earlier in
life, is also crucial. The reduction of societal stressors can promote active life expectancy. In
the last 40 years, smoking rates have decreased, but obesity has increased, and physical
activity has only modestly increased.

How Does Aging Affect Information Processing?
There are numerous stereotypes regarding older adults as being forgetful and confused, but what
does the research on memory and cognition in late adulthood reveal? Memory comes in many
types, such as working, episodic, semantic, implicit, and prospective. There are also many
processes involved in memory, thus it should not be a surprise that there are declines in some
types of memory and memory processes, while other areas of memory are maintained or even
show some improvement with age. In this section, we will focus on changes in memory,
attention, problem solving, intelligence, and wisdom, including the exaggeration of losses
stereotyped in the elderly.

Memory
Figure 9.27
Changes in Working Memory: As discussed in chapter
4, working memory is the more active, effortful part of our
memory system. Working memory is composed of three
major systems: The phonological loop that maintains
information about auditory stimuli, the visuospatial
sketchpad, that maintains information about visual
stimuli, and the central executive, that oversees working
memory, allocating resources where needed and
monitoring whether cognitive strategies are being effective
(Schwartz, 2011). Schwartz reports that it is the central
executive that is most negatively impacted by age. In tasks
that require allocation of attention between different
stimuli, older adults fair worse than do younger adults. In a Source
study by Göthe, Oberauer, and Kliegl (2007) older and
younger adults were asked to learn two tasks simultaneously. Young adults eventually managed
to learn and perform each task without any loss in speed and efficiency, although it did take
considerable practice. None of the older adults were able to achieve this. Yet, older adults could
perform at young adult levels if they had been asked to learn each task individually. Having
older adults learn and perform both tasks together was too taxing for the central executive. In
contrast, working memory tasks that do not require much input from the central executive, such
as the digit span test, which uses predominantly the phonological loop, we find that older adults
perform on par with young adults (Dixon & Cohen, 2003).
Changes in Long-term Memory: As you should recall, long-term memory is divided into
semantic (knowledge of facts), episodic (events), and implicit (procedural skills, classical
conditioning and priming) memories. Semantic and episodic memory are part of the explicit
memory system, which requires conscious effort to create and retrieve. Several studies
consistently reveal that episodic memory shows greater age-related declines than semantic
memory (Schwartz, 2011; Spaniol, Madden, & Voss, 2006). It has been suggested that episodic
memories may be harder to encode and retrieve because they contain at least two different types
of memory, the event and when and where the event took place. In contrast, semantic memories
are not tied to any particular time line. Thus, only the knowledge needs to be encoded or
retrieved (Schwartz, 2011). Spaniol et al. (2006) found that retrieval of semantic information
399

was considerably faster for both younger and older adults than the retrieval of episodic
information, with there being little difference between the two age groups for semantic memory
retrieval. They note that older adults’ poorer performance on episodic memory appeared to be
related to slower processing of the information and the difficulty of the task. They found that as
the task became increasingly difficult, the gap between each age groups’ performance increased
for episodic memory more so than for semantic memory.
Studies which test general knowledge (semantic memory), such as politics and history (Dixon,
Rust, Feltmate, & See, 2007), or vocabulary/lexical memory (Dahlgren, 1998) often find that
older adults outperform younger adults. However, older adults do find that they experience more
“blocks” at retrieving information that they know. In other words, they experience more tip-ofthe-tongue (TOT) events than do younger adults (Schwartz, 2011).
Implicit memory requires little conscious effort and often involves skills or more habitual
patterns of behavior. This type of memory shows few declines with age. Many studies assessing
implicit memory measure the effects of priming. Priming refers to changes in behavior as a
result of frequent or recent experiences. If you were shown pictures of food and asked to rate
their appearance and then later were asked to complete words such as s_ _ p, you may be more
likely to write soup than soap, or ship. The images of food “primed” your memory for words
connected to food. Does this type of memory and learning change with age? The answer is
typically “no” for most older adults (Schacter, Church, & Osowiecki, 1994).
Prospective memory refers to remembering
Figure 9.28 Aids for Prospective Memory
things we need to do in the future, such as
remembering a doctor’s appointment next
week, or to take medication before bedtime.
It has been described as “the flip-side of
episodic memory” (Schwartz, 2011, p. 119).
Episodic memories are the recall of events in
our past, while the focus of prospective
memories is of events in our future. In
general, humans are fairly good at prospective
memory if they have little else to do in the
meantime. However, when there are
competing tasks that are also demanding our
attention, this type of memory rapidly
declines. The explanation given for this is
Source
that this form of memory draws on the central
executive of working memory, and when this
component of working memory is absorbed in other tasks, our ability to remember to do
something else in the future is more likely to slip out of memory (Schwartz, 2011). However,
prospective memories are often divided into time-based prospective memories, such as having
to remember to do something at a future time, or event-based prospective memories, such as
having to remember to do something when a certain event occurs. When age-related declines are
found, they are more likely to be time-based, than event-based, and in laboratory settings rather
than in the real-world, where older adults can show comparable or slightly better prospective
400

memory performance (Henry, MacLeod, Phillips & Crawford, 2004; Luo & Craik, 2008). This
should not be surprising given the tendency of older adults to be more selective in where they
place their physical, mental, and social energy. Having to remember a doctor’s appointment is of
greater concern than remembering to hit the space-bar on a computer every time the word “tiger”
is displayed.
Recall versus Recognition: Memory performance often depends on whether older adults are
asked to simply recognize previously learned material or recall material on their own. Generally,
for all humans, recognition tasks are easier because they require less cognitive energy. Older
adults show roughly equivalent memory to young adults when assessed with a recognition task
(Rhodes, Castel, & Jacoby, 2008). With recall measures, older adults show memory deficits in
comparison to younger adults. While the effect is initially not that large, starting at age 40 adults
begin to show declines in recall memory compared to younger adults (Schwartz, 2011).

Figure 9.29

The Age Advantage: Fewer age differences are observed when
memory cues are available, such as for recognition memory
tasks, or when individuals can draw upon acquired knowledge
or experience. For example, older adults often perform as well
if not better than young adults on tests of word knowledge or
vocabulary. With age often comes expertise, and research has
pointed to areas where aging experts perform quite well. For
example, older typists were found to compensate for agerelated declines in speed by looking farther ahead at printed
text (Salthouse, 1984). Compared to younger players, older
chess experts focus on a smaller set of possible moves, leading
to greater cognitive efficiency (Charness, 1981). Accrued
knowledge of everyday tasks, such as grocery prices, can help
older adults to make better decisions than young adults
(Tentori, Osheron, Hasher, & May, 2001).

Attention and Problem Solving
Changes in Attention in Late Adulthood: Changes in sensory functioning and speed of
processing information in late adulthood often translates into changes in attention (Jefferies et
al., 2015). Research has shown that older adults are less able to selectively focus on information
while ignoring distractors (Jefferies et al., 2015; Wascher, Schneider, Hoffman, Beste, & Sänger,
2012), although Jefferies and her colleagues found that when given double time, older adults
could perform at young adult levels. Other studies have also found that older adults have greater
difficulty shifting their attention between objects or locations (Tales, Muir, Bayer, & Snowden,
2002). Consider the implication of these attentional changes for older adults.
How do changes or maintenance of cognitive ability affect older adults’ everyday lives?
Researchers have studied cognition in the context of several different everyday activities. One
example is driving. Although older adults often have more years of driving experience, cognitive
declines related to reaction time or attentional processes may pose limitations under certain
circumstances (Park & Gutchess, 2000). In contrast, research on interpersonal problem solving
401

suggested that older adults use more effective strategies than younger adults to navigate through
social and emotional problems (Blanchard-Fields, 2007). In the context of work, researchers
rarely find that older individuals perform poorer on the job (Park & Gutchess, 2000). Similar to
everyday problem solving, older workers may develop more efficient strategies and rely on
expertise to compensate for cognitive decline.
Problem Solving: Problem solving tasks that require processing non-meaningful information
quickly (a kind of task that might be part of a laboratory experiment on mental processes)
declines with age. However, many real-life challenges facing older adults do not rely on speed of
processing or making choices on one’s own. Older adults resolve everyday problems by relying
on input from others, such as family and friends. They are also less likely than younger adults to
delay making decisions on important matters, such as medical care (Strough, Hicks, Swenson,
Cheng & Barnes, 2003; Meegan & Berg, 2002).
What might explain these deficits as we age? The processing speed theory, proposed by
Salthouse (1996, 2004), suggests that as the nervous system slows with advanced age our ability
to process information declines. This slowing of processing speed may explain age differences
on many different cognitive tasks. For instance, as we age, working memory becomes less
efficient (Craik & Bialystok, 2006). Older adults also need longer time to complete mental tasks
or make decisions. Yet, when given sufficient time older adults perform as competently as do
young adults (Salthouse, 1996). Thus, when speed is not imperative to the task healthy older
adults do not show cognitive declines.
In contrast, inhibition theory argues that older adults have difficulty with inhibitory functioning,
or the ability to focus on certain information while suppressing attention to less pertinent
information tasks (Hasher & Zacks, 1988). Evidence comes from directed forgetting research. In
directed forgetting people are asked to forget or ignore some information, but not other
information. For example, you might be asked to memorize a list of words but are then told that
the researcher made a mistake and gave you the wrong list and asks you to “forget” this list. You
are then given a second list to memorize. While most people do well at forgetting the first list,
older adults are more likely to recall more words from the “forget-to-recall” list than are younger
adults (Andrés, Van der Linden, & Parmentier, 2004).
Cognitive losses exaggerated: While there are
information processing losses in late adulthood,
overall loss has been exaggerated (Garrett, 2015).
One explanation is that the type of tasks that people
are tested on tend to be meaningless. For example,
older individuals are not motivated to remember a
random list of words in a study, but they are
motivated for more meaningful material related to
their life, and consequently perform better on those
tests. Another reason is that the research is often
cross-sectional. When age comparisons occur
longitudinally, however, the amount of loss
diminishes (Schaie, 1994). A third reason is that the
402

Figure 9.30

Source

loss may be due to a lack of opportunity in using various skills. When older adults practiced
skills, they performed as well as they had previously. Although diminished performance speed is
especially noteworthy in the elderly, Schaie (1994) found that statistically removing the effects
of speed diminished the individual’s performance declines significantly. In fact, Salthouse and
Babcock (1991) demonstrated that processing speed accounted for all but 1% of age-related
differences in working memory when testing individuals from 18 to 82. Finally, it is well
established that our hearing and vision decline as we age. Longitudinal research has proposed
that deficits in sensory functioning explain age differences in a variety of cognitive abilities
(Baltes & Lindenberger, 1997). Not surprisingly, more years of education, and subsequently
higher income, are associated with higher cognitive level and slower cognitive decline (Zahodne,
Stern, & Manly, 2015).

Intelligence and Wisdom
When looking at scores on traditional intelligence tests, tasks measuring verbal skills show
minimal or no age-related declines, while scores on performance tests, which measure solving
problems quickly, decline with age (Botwinick, 1984). This profile mirrors crystalized and fluid
intelligence. As you recall from last chapter, crystallized intelligence encompasses abilities that
draw upon experience and knowledge. Measures of crystallized intelligence include vocabulary
tests, solving number problems, and understanding texts. Fluid intelligence refers to information
processing abilities, such as logical reasoning, remembering lists, spatial ability, and reaction
time. Baltes (1993) introduced two additional types of intelligence to reflect cognitive changes in
aging. Pragmatics of intelligence are cultural exposure to facts and procedures that are
maintained as one ages and are similar to crystalized intelligence. Mechanics of intelligence
are dependent on brain functioning and decline with age, similar to fluid intelligence. Baltes
indicated that pragmatics of intelligence show little decline and typically increase with age.
Additionally, pragmatics of intelligence may compensate for the declines that occur with
mechanics of intelligence. In summary, global cognitive declines are not typical as one ages, and
individuals compensate for some cognitive declines, especially processing speed.
Wisdom is the ability to use the accumulated knowledge about practical matters that allows for
sound judgment and decision making. A wise person is insightful and has knowledge that can be
used to overcome obstacles in living. Does aging bring wisdom? While living longer brings
experience, it does not always bring wisdom. Paul Baltes and his colleagues (Baltes &
Kunzmann, 2004; Baltes & Staudinger, 2000) suggest that wisdom is rare. In addition, the
emergence of wisdom can be seen in late adolescence and young adulthood, with there being few
gains in wisdom over the course of adulthood (Staudinger & Gluck, 2011). This would suggest
that factors other than age are stronger determinants of wisdom. Occupations and experiences
that emphasize others rather than self, along with personality characteristics, such as openness to
experience and generativity, are more likely to provide the building blocks of wisdom (Baltes &
Kunzmann, 2004). Age combined with a certain types of experience and/or personality brings
wisdom.

403

Neurocognitive Disorders
Historically, the term dementia was used to refer to an individual experiencing difficulties with
memory, language, abstract thinking, reasoning, decision making, and problem-solving (Erber
& Szuchman (2015). However, in the latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders Fifth Edition (DSM-5) (American Psychiatric Association, 2013) the term
dementia has been replaced by neurocognitive disorder. A major neurocognitive disorder is
diagnosed as a significant cognitive decline from a previous level of performance in one or
more cognitive domains and interferes with independent functioning, while a minor
neurocognitive disorder is diagnosed as a modest cognitive decline from a previous level of
performance in one of more cognitive domains and does not interfere with independent
functioning. There are several different neurocognitive disorders that are typically
demonstrated in late adulthood and determining the exact type can be difficult because the
symptoms may overlap with each other. Diagnosis often includes a medical history, physical
exam, laboratory tests, and changes noted in behavior. Alzheimer’s disease, vascular
neurocognitive disorder and neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies will be discussed
below.
Alzheimer’s Disease: Probably the most well-known and most common neurocognitive
disorder for older individuals is Alzheimer’s disease. In 2016 an estimated 5.4 million
Americans were diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease (Alzheimer’s Association, 2016), which
was approximately one in nine aged 65 and over. By 2050 the number of people age 65 and
older with Alzheimer's disease is projected to be 13.8 million if there are no medical
breakthroughs to prevent or cure the disease. Alzheimer’s disease is the 6th leading cause of
death in the United States, but the 5th leading cause for those 65 and older. Among the top 10
causes of death in America, Alzheimer's disease is the only one that cannot be prevented,
cured, or even slowed. Current estimates indicate that Alzheimer disease affects
approximately 50% of those identified with a neurocognitive disorder (Cohen & Eisdorfer,
2011).
Alzheimer’s disease has a gradual onset with subtle personality changes and memory loss that
differs from normal age-related memory problems occurring first. Confusion, difficulty with
change, and deterioration in language, problem-solving skills, and personality become evident
Figure 9.31

next. In the later stages, the individual loses physical coordination and is unable to complete
everyday tasks, including self-care and personal hygiene (Erber & Szuchman, 2015). Lastly,
individuals lose the ability to respond to their environment, to carry on a conversation, and
eventually to control movement (Alzheimer’s Association, 2016). On average people with
Alzheimer’s survive eight years, but some may live up to 20 years. The disease course often
depends on the individual’s age and whether they have other health conditions.
The greatest risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease is age, but there are genetic and environmental
factors that can also contribute. Some forms of Alzheimer’s are hereditary, and with the early
onset type, several rare genes have been identified that directly cause Alzheimer's. People who
inherit these genes tend to develop symptoms in their 30s, 40s and 50s. Five percent of those
identified with Alzheimer’s disease are younger than age 65. When Alzheimer's disease is
caused by deterministic genes, it is called familial Alzheimer's disease (Alzheimer’s Association,
2016). Traumatic brain injury is also a risk factor, as well as obesity, hypertension, high
cholesterol, and diabetes (Carlson, 2011).
Βeta Amyloid and Tau: According to Erber and Szuchman (2015) the problems that occur
with Alzheimer’s disease are due to the “death of neurons, the breakdown of connections
between them, and the extensive formation of plaques and tau, which interfere with neuron
functioning and neuron survival” (p. 50). Plaques are abnormal formations of protein pieces
called beta-amyloid. Beta-amyloid comes from a larger protein found in the fatty membrane
surrounding nerve cells. Because beta-amyloid is sticky, it builds up into plaques (Alzheimer’s
Association, 2016). These plaques appear to block cell communication and may also trigger
an inflammatory response in the immune system, which leads to further neuronal death.
Tau is an important protein that helps maintain the brain’s transport system. When tau
malfunctions, it changes into twisted strands called tangles that disrupt the transport system.
Consequently, nutrients and other supplies cannot move through the cells and they eventually
die. The death of neurons lead to the brain shrinking and affecting all aspects of brain
Figure 9.32 Plaques and Tangles

functioning. For example, the hippocampus is involved in learning and memory, and the brain
cells in this region are often the first to be damaged. This is why memory loss is often one of
the earliest symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Figures 9.32 and 9.33 illustrate the difference
between an Alzheimer’s brain and a healthy brain.
Washington University School of Medicine (2019) reported that researchers associated with the
School of Medicine discovered that failing immune cells, known as microglia, appear be the link
between amyloid and tau, which are the two damaging proteins of Alzheimer's disease. Amyloid
plaques, which appear first, do not cause Alzheimer’s, but the presence of amyloid leads to the
formation of tau tangles, which are responsible for the memory loss and cognitive deficits seen in
those with Alzheimer’s disease. It appears that weakening microglia cause the amyloid plaques
to injure nearby neurons, thus creating a toxic environment that increases the formation and
spread of tau tangles. These findings could lead to a new approach for developing therapies for
Alzheimer's.
Sleep Deprivation and Alzheimer’s: Studies suggest that sleep plays a role in clearing both
beta-amyloid and tau out of the brain. Shokri-Kojori et al. (2018) scanned participants’ brains
after getting a full night’s rest and after 31 hours without sleep. Beta-amyloid increased about
5% in the participants’ brains after losing a night of sleep. These changes occurred in brain
regions that included the thalamus and hippocampus, which are associated with the early stages
of Alzheimer’s disease. Shokri-Kojori et al. also found that participants with the largest increases
in beta-amyloid reported the worst mood after sleep deprivation. These findings support other
studies that have found that the hippocampus and thalamus are involved in mood disorders.
Additionally, Holth et al. (2019) found that healthy adults who remained awake all day and
night, had tau levels that were elevated by about 50 percent. Once tau begins to accumulate in
brain tissue, the protein can spread from one brain area to the next along neural connections.
Holth et al. also found that older people who had more tau tangles in their brains by PET
scanning had less slow-wave, deep sleep. Holth et al. concluded that good sleep habits and/or
treatments designed to encourage plenty of high-quality sleep might play an important role in
slowing Alzheimer’s disease. In contrast, poor sleep might worsen the condition and serve as an
early warning sign of Alzheimer’s disease.
Figure 9.34

Healthy Lifestyle Combats Alzheimer’s: Dhana and
colleagues with the Rush University Medical Center in
Chicago examined how healthy lifestyle mitigates the
risk of Alzheimer’s disease (Natanson, 2019). The
researchers followed a diverse group of 2765
participants for 9 years and focused on five low-risk
lifestyle factors: healthy diet, at least 150
minutes/week of moderate to vigorous physical
activity, not smoking, light to moderate alcohol intake,
and engaging in cognitively stimulating activities.
Results indicated that those who adopted four or five
low-risk lifestyle factors had a 60% lower risk of
Alzheimer’s disease when compared with participants
who did not follow any or only one of the low-risk
406

factors. The authors concluded that incorporating these lifestyle changes can have a positive
effect on one’s brain functioning and lower the risk for Alzheimer’s disease.
Vascular Neurocognitive Disorder is the second most common neurocognitive disorder
affecting 0.2% in the 65-70 years age group and 16% of individuals 80 years and older
(American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Vascular neurocognitive disorder is associated with
a blockage of cerebral blood vessels that affects one part of the brain rather than a general loss
of brain cells seen with Alzheimer’s disease. Personality is not as affected in vascular
neurocognitive disorder, and more males are diagnosed than females (Erber and Szuchman,
2015). It also comes on more abruptly than Alzheimer’s disease and has a shorter course
before death. Risk factors include smoking, diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, or a history
of strokes.
Neurocognitive Disorder with Lewy bodies: According to the National Institute on Aging
(2015a), Lewy bodies are microscopic protein deposits found in neurons seen postmortem. They
affect chemicals in the brain that can lead to difficulties in thinking, movement, behavior and
mood. Neurocognitive Disorder with Lewy bodies is the third most common form and affects
more than 1 million Americans. It typically begins at age 50 or older and appears to affect
slightly more men than women. The disease lasts approximately 5 to 7 years from the time of
diagnosis to death but can range from 2 to 20 years depending on the individual’s age, health,
and severity of symptoms. Lewy bodies can occur in both the cortex and brain stem which
results in cognitive as well as motor symptoms (Erber & Szuchman, 2015). The movement
symptoms are similar to those with Parkinson’s disease and include tremors and muscle rigidity.
However, the motor disturbances occur at the same time as the cognitive symptoms, unlike with
Parkinson’s disease when the cognitive symptoms occur well after the motor symptoms.
Individuals diagnosed with Neurocognitive Disorder with Lewy bodies also experience sleep
disturbances, recurrent visual hallucinations, and are at risk for falling.

Work, Retirement, and Leisure
Work: According to the United States
Census Bureau, in 1994, approximately
12% of those employed were 65 and
over, and by 2016, the percentage had
increased to 18% of those employed
(McEntarfer, 2019). Looking more
closely at the age ranges, more than
40% of Americans in their 60s are still
working, while 14% of people in their
70s and just 4% of those 80 and older
are currently employed (Livingston,
2019). Even though they make up a
smaller number of workers overall,
those 65- to 74-year-old and 75-andolder age groups are projected to have
the fastest rates of growth in the next

Figure 9.35 2014-2024 Percentage Labor Growth
by Age Group

Source

407

decade. See Figure 9.35 for the projected annual growth rate in labor force by age in percentages,
2014-2024.
Livingston (2019) reported that, similar to other age groups, those with higher levels of
education are more likely to be employed. Approximately 37% of adults who are 60 and older
and have a bachelor’s degree or more are working. In contrast, 31% with some college
experience and 21% of those with a high school diploma or less are still working at age 60 and
beyond. Additionally, men 60 and older are more likely to be working than women (33% vs.
24%). Not only are older persons working more, but they are also earning more than previously,
and their growth in earnings is greater compared to workers of other ages (McEntarfer, 2019).
Older adults are proving just as capable as younger adults at the workplace. In fact, jobs that
require social skills, accumulated knowledge, and relevant experiences favor older adults (Erber
& Szuchman, 2015). Older adults also demonstrate lower rates of absenteeism and greater
investment in their work.
Transitioning into Retirement: For most Americans, retirement is a process and not a one-time
event (Quinn & Cahill, 2016). Sixty percent of workers transition straight to bridge jobs, which
are often part-time, and occur between a career and full retirement. About 15% of workers get
another job after being fully retired. This may be due to not having adequate finances after
retirement or not enjoying their retirement. Some of these jobs may be in encore careers, or
work in a different field from the one in which they retired. Approximately 10% of workers
begin phasing into retirement by reducing their hours. However, not all employers will allow
this due to pension regulations.
Retirement age changes: Looking at retirement data, the average age of retirement declined
from more than 70 in 1910 to age 63 in the early 1980s. However, this trend has reversed and
the current average age is now 65. Additionally, 18.5% of those over the age of 65 continue to
work (US Department of Health and Human Services, 2012) compared with only 12% in 1990
(U. S. Government Accountability Office, 2011). With individuals living longer, once retired the
average amount of time a retired worker collects social security is approximately 17-18 years
(James, Matz-Costa, & Smyer, 2016).
When to retire: Laws often influence when someone decides to retire. In 1986 the Age
Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) was amended, and mandatory retirement was
eliminated for most workers (Erber & Szuchman, 2015). Pilots, air traffic controllers, federal
law enforcement, national park rangers, and fire fighters continue to have enforced retirement
ages. Consequently, for most workers they can continue to work if they choose and are able.
Social security benefits also play a role. For those born before 1938, they can receive full social
security benefits at age 65. For those born between 1943 and 1954, they must wait until age 66
for full benefits, and for those born after 1959 they must wait until age 67 (Social Security
Administration, 2016). Extra months are added to those born in years between. For example, if
born in 1957, the person must wait until 66 years and 6 months. The longer one waits to receive
social security, the more money will be paid out. Those retiring at age 62, will only receive 75%
of their monthly benefits. Medicare health insurance is another entitlement that is not available
until one is aged 65.

408

Delayed Retirement: Older adults primarily choose to delay
retirement due to economic reasons (Erber & Szchman,
2015). Financially, continuing to work provides not only
added income, but also does not dip into retirement savings
which may not be sufficient. Historically, there have been
three parts to retirement income; that is, social security, a
pension plan, and individual savings (Quinn & Cahill, 2016).
With the 2008 recession, pension plans lost value for most
workers. Consequently, many older workers have had to
work later in life to compensate for absent or minimal
pension plans and personal savings. Social security was
never intended to replace full income, and the benefits
provided may not cover all the expenses, so elders continue to
work. Unfortunately, many older individuals are unable to
secure later employment, and those especially vulnerable
include persons with disabilities, single women, the oldestold, and individuals with intermittent work histories.

Some older adults delay retirement for psychological reasons, such as health benefits and social
contacts. Recent research indicates that delaying retirement has been associated with helping
one live longer. When looking at both healthy and unhealthy retirees, a one-year delay in retiring
was associated with a decreased risk of death from all causes (Wu, Odden, Fisher, & Stawski,
2016). When individuals are forced to retire due to health concerns or downsizing, they are more
likely to have negative physical and psychological consequences (Erber & Szuchman, 2015).
Retirement Stages: Atchley (1994) identified several phases that individuals ago through when
they retire:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Remote pre-retirement phase includes fantasizing about what one wants to do in
retirement
Immediate pre-retirement phase when concrete plans are established
Actual retirement
Honeymoon phase when retirees travel and participate in activities they could not do
while working
Disenchantment phase when retirees experience an emotional let-down
Reorientation phase when the retirees attempt to adjust to retirement by making less
hectic plans and getting into a regular routine

Not everyone goes through every stage, but this model demonstrates that retirement is a process.
Post-retirement: Those who look most forward to retirement and have plans are those who
anticipate adequate income (Erber & Szuchman, 2015). This is especially true for males who
have worked consistently and have a pension and/or adequate savings. Once retired, staying
active and socially engaged is important. Volunteering, caregiving and informal helping can
keep seniors engaged. Kaskie, Imhof, Cavanaugh and Culp (2008) found that 70% of retirees
who are not involved in productive activities spent most of their time watching TV, which is
correlated with negative affect. In contrast, being productive improves well-being.

Elder Education: Attending college is not just for the young
as discussed in the previous chapter. There are many reasons
why someone in late adulthood chooses to attend college.
PNC Financial Services surveyed retirees aged 70 and over
and found that 58% indicated that they had retired before they
had planned (Holland, 2014). Many of these individuals chose
to pursue additional training to improve skills to return to work
in a second career. Others may be looking to take their career
in a new direction. For some older students who no longer are
focus on financial reasons, returning to school is intended to
enable them to pursue work that is personally fulfilling.
Attending college in late adulthood is also a great way for
seniors to stay young and keep their minds sharp.

Even if an elder chooses not to attend college for a degree,
there are many continuing education programs on topics of
Source
interest available. In 1975, a nonprofit educational travel
organization called Elderhostel began in New Hampshire with
five programs for several hundred retired participants (DiGiacomo, 2015). This program
combined college classroom time with travel tours and experiential learning experiences. In
2010 the organization changed its name to Road Scholar, and it now serves 100,000 people per
year in the U.S. and in 150 countries. Academic courses, as well as practical skills such as
computer classes, foreign languages, budgeting, and holistic medicines, are among the courses
offered. Older adults who have higher levels of education are more likely to take continuing
education. However, offering more educational experiences to a diverse group of older adults,
including those who are institutionalized in nursing homes, can bring enhance the quality of life.
Leisure: During the past 10 years, leisure time for Americans 60
Figure 9.38
and older has remained at about 7 hours a day. However, the
amount of time spent on TVs, computers, tablets or other
electronic devices has risen almost 30 minutes per day over the
past decade (Livingston, 2019). Those 60 and older now spend
more than half of their daily leisure time (4 hours and 16 minutes)
in front of screens. Screen time has increased for those in their 60s,
70s, 80s and beyond, and across genders and education levels. This
rise in screen time coincides with significant growth in the use of
digital technology by older Americans. In 2000, 14% of those aged
65 and older used the Internet, and now 73% are users and 53%
own smartphones. Alternatively, the time spent on other
recreational activities, such as reading or socializing, has gone
Source
down slightly. People with less education spend more of their
leisure time on screens and less time reading compared with those
with more education. Less educated adults also spend less time exercising: 12 minutes a day for
those with a high school diploma or less, compared with 26 minutes for college graduates.

Ageism
Stereotypes of people in late adulthood lead many to assume that aging
automatically brings poor physical health and mental decline. These
stereotypes are reflected in everyday conversations, the media, and even
in greeting cards (Overstreet, 2006). Age is not revered in the United
States, and so laughing about getting older in birthday cards is one way
to get relief. The negative attitudes people have about those in late
adulthood are examples of ageism, or prejudice based on age. The term
ageism was first used in 1969, and according to Nelson (2016), ageism
remains one of the most institutionalized forms of prejudice today.

Figure 9.39

Nelson (2016) reviewed the research on ageism and concluded that
when older individuals believed their culture’s negative stereotypes
Source
about those who are old, their memory and cognitive skills declined. In
contrast, older individuals in cultures, such as China, that held more
positive views on aging did not demonstrate cognitive deficits. It appears that when one agrees
with the stereotype, it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, or the belief in one’s ability results in
actions that make it come true.
Being the target of stereotypes can adversely affect individuals’ performance on tasks because
they worry they will confirm the cultural stereotypes. This is known as stereotype threat, and it
was originally used to explain race and gender differences in academic achievement (Gatz et al.,
2016). Stereotype threat research has demonstrated that older adults who internalize the aging
411

stereotypes will exhibit worse memory performance, worse physical performance, and reduced
self-efficacy (Levy, 2009).
In terms of physically taking care of themselves, those who believe in negative stereotypes are
less likely to engage in preventative health behaviors, less likely to recover from illnesses, and
more likely to feel stress and anxiety, which can adversely affect immune functioning and
cardiovascular health (Nelson, 2016). Additionally, individuals who attribute their health
problems to their age, had a higher death rate. Similarly, doctors who believe that illnesses are
just natural consequence of aging are less likely to have older adults participate in clinical trials
or receive life-sustaining treatment. In contrast, those older adults who possess positive and
optimistic views of aging are less likely to have physical or mental health problems and are more
likely to live longer. Removing societal stereotypes about aging and helping older adults reject
those notions of aging is another way to promote health and life expectancy among the elderly.
Minority status: Older minority adults accounted for approximately 21% of the U. S. population
in 2012 but are expected to reach 39% of the population in 2050 (U. S. Census Bureau, 2012).
Unfortunately, racism is a further concern for minority elderly already suffering from ageism.
Older adults who are African American, Mexican American, and Asian American experience
psychological problems that are often associated with discrimination by the White majority
(Youdin, 2016). Ethnic minorities are also more likely to become sick, but less likely to receive
medical intervention. Older, minority women can face ageism, racism, and sexism, often referred
to as triple jeopardy (Hinze, Lin, & Andersson, 2012), which can adversely affect their life in
late adulthood.
Poverty rates: According to Quinn and Cahill (2016), the poverty rate for older adults varies
based on gender, marital status, race, and age. Women aged 65 or older were 70% more likely to
be poor than men, and older women aged 80 and above have higher levels of poverty than those
younger. Married couples are less likely to be poor than nonmarried men and women, and
poverty is more prevalent among older racial minorities. In 2012 the poverty rates for White
older men (5.6%) and White older women (9.6%) were lower than for Black older men (14%),
Black older women (21%), Hispanic older men (19%), and Hispanic older women (22%).

Living Arrangements
Do those in late adulthood primarily live alone? No. In 2017, of those 65 years of age and
older, approximately 72% of men and 48% of women lived with their spouse or partner
(Administration on Aging, 2017). Between 1900 and 1990 the number of older adults living
alone increased, most likely due to improvements in health and longevity during this time (see
Figure 9.40). Since 1990 the number of older adults living alone has declined, because of older
women more likely to be living with their spouse or children (Stepler, 2016c). Women continue
to make up the majority of older adults living alone in the U.S., although that number has
dropped from those living alone in 1990 (Stepler, 2016a). Older women are more likely to be
unmarried, living with children, with other relatives or non-relatives. Older men are more likely
to be living alone than they were in 1990, although older men are more likely to reside with their
spouse. The rise in divorce among those in late adulthood, along with the drop-in remarriage
rate, has resulted in slightly more older men living alone today than in the past (Stepler, 2016c).

412

Figure 9.40 Living Arrangements for those 65 and
older in 2017

Older adults who live alone
report feeling more financially
strapped than do those living
with others (Stepler, 2016d).
According to a Pew Research
Center Survey, only 33% of
those living alone reported they
were living comfortably, while
nearly 49% of those living with
others said they were living
comfortably. Similarly, 12% of
those living alone, but only 5%
of those living with others,
reported that they lacked money
for basic needs (Stepler, 2016d).

Do those in late adulthood
primarily live with family
members? No, but according to
the Pew Research Center, there
has been an increase in the
number of families living in
multigenerational housing; that
is three generations living
Source
together than in previous
generations (Cohn & Passel,
2018). In 2016, a record 64 million Americans, or 20% of the population, lived in a house with
at least two adult generations. However, ethnic differences are noted in the percentage of
multigenerational households with Hispanic (27%), Black (26%), and Asian (29%) families
living together in greater numbers than White families (16%). Consequently, the majority of
older adults wish to live independently for as long as they are able.
Do those in late adulthood move after retirement? No. According to Erber and Szuchman
(2015), the majority of those in late adulthood remain in the same location, and often in the same
house, where they lived before retiring. Although some younger late adults (65-74 years) may
relocate to warmer climates, once they are older (75-84 years) they often return to their home
states to be closer to adult children (Stoller & Longino, 2001). Despite the previous trends,
however, the recent housing crisis has kept those in late adulthood in their current suburban
locations because they are unable to sell their homes (Erber & Szuchman, 2015).
Do those in late adulthood primarily live in institutions? No. Only a small portion (3.2%) of
adults older than 65 lived in an institution in 2015 (United States Department of Health and
Human Services, 2015). However, as individuals increase in age the percentage of those living
in institutions, such as a nursing home, also increases. Specifically: 1% of those 65-74, 3% of
those 75-84, and 10% of those 85 years and older lived in an institution in 2015. Due to the
increasing number of baby boomers reaching late adulthood, the number of people who will
depend on long-term care is expected to rise from 12 million in 2010 to 27 million in 2050
413

(United States Senate Commission on Long-Term Care, 2013). To meet this higher demand for
services, a focus on the least restrictive care alternatives has resulted in a shift toward home and
community-based care instead of placement in a nursing home (Gatz et al., 2016).

Erikson: Integrity vs. Despair
How do people cope with old age? According to Erikson, the last psychosocial stage is Integrity
vs. Despair. This stage includes, “a retrospective accounting of one’s life to date; how much
one embraces life as having been well lived, as opposed to regretting missed opportunities,”
(Erikson, 1982, p. 112). Those in late adulthood need to achieve both the acceptance of their
life and the inevitability of their death (Barker, 2016). This stage includes finding meaning in
one’s life and accepting one’s accomplishments, but also acknowledging what in life has not
gone as hoped. It is also feeling a sense of contentment and accepting others’ deficiencies,
including those of their parents. This acceptance will lead to integrity, but if elders are unable to
achieve this acceptance, they may experience despair. Bitterness and resentments in
relationships and life events can lead one to despair at the end of life. According to Erikson
(1982), successful completion of this stage leads to wisdom in late life.
Erikson’s theory was the first to propose a lifespan approach to development, and it has
encouraged the belief that older adults still have developmental needs. Prior to Erikson’s theory,
older adulthood was seen as a time of social and leisure restrictions and a focus primarily on
physical needs (Barker, 2016). The current focus on aging well by keeping healthy and active,
helps to promote integrity. There are many avenues for those in late adulthood to remain vital
members of society, and they will be explored next.
Staying Active: Many older adults want to remain
active and work toward replacing opportunities lost with
new ones. Those who prefer to keep themselves busy
demonstrate the Activity Theory, which states that
greater satisfaction with one’s life occurs with those
who remain active (Lemon, Bengston, & Peterson,
1972). Not surprisingly, more positive views on aging
and greater health are noted with those who keep active
than those who isolate themselves and disengage with
others. Community, faith-based, and volunteer
organizations can all provide those in late adulthood
with opportunities to remain active and maintain social
networks. Erikson’s concept of generativity applies to
many older adults, just as it did in midlife.

Figure 9.41

Source

Generativity in Late Adulthood
Research suggests that generativity is not just a concern for midlife adults, but for many elders,
concerns about future generations continue into late adulthood. As previously discussed, some
older adults are continuing to work beyond age 65. Additionally, they are volunteering in their
community, and raising their grandchildren in greater numbers.
414

Volunteering: Many older adults spend time volunteering. Hooyman and Kiyak (2011) found
that religious organizations are the primary settings for encouraging and providing opportunities
to volunteer. Hospitals and environmental groups also provide volunteer opportunities for older
adults. While volunteering peaks in middle adulthood, it continues to remain high among adults
in their 60s, with about 40% engaging in volunteerism (Hooyman & Kiyak, 2011). While the
number of older adults volunteering their time does decline with age, the number of hours older
adults volunteer does not show much decline until they are in their late 70s (Hendricks & Cutler,
2004). African-American older adults volunteer at higher levels than other ethnic groups
(Taylor, Chatters, & Leving, 2004). Taylor and colleagues attribute this to the higher
involvement in religious organizations by older African-Americans.
Volunteering aids older adults as much
as it does the community at large.
Older adults who volunteer experience
more social contact, which has been
linked to higher rates of life
satisfaction, and lower rates of
depression and anxiety (Pilkington,
Windsor, & Crisp, 2012).
Longitudinal research also finds a
strong link between health in later
adulthood and volunteering (Kahana,
Bhatta, Lovegreen, Kahana, &
Midlarsky, 2013). Lee and colleagues
found that even among the oldest-old,
Source
the death rate of those who volunteer is
half that of non-volunteers (Lee,
Steinman, & Tan, 2011). However, older adults who volunteer may already be healthier, which
is why they can volunteer compared to their less heathy age mates.
Figure 9.42

New opportunities exist for older adults to serve as virtual volunteers by dialoguing online with
others from around the world and sharing their support, interests, and expertise. These volunteer
opportunities range from helping teens with their writing to communicating with ‘neighbors’ in
villages of developing countries. Virtual volunteering is available to those who cannot engage in
face-to-face interactions, and it opens-up a new world of possibilities and ways to connect,
maintain identity, and be productive.
Grandparents Raising Grandchildren: According to the 2014 American Community Survey
(U.S. Census, 2014a), over 5.5 million children under the age of 18 were living in families
headed by a grandparent. This was more than a half a million increase from 2010. While most
grandparents raising grandchildren are between the ages of 55 and 64, approximately 25% of
grandparents raising their grandchildren are 65 and older (Office on Women’s Health, 2010a).
For many grandparents, parenting a second time can be harder. Older adults have far less

415

Figure 9.43

Source

energy, and often the reason why they are now acting
as parents to their grandchildren is because traumatic
events. A survey by AARP (Goyer, 2010) found that
grandparents were raising their grandchildren because
the parents had problems with drugs and alcohol, had
a mental illness, were incarcerated, had divorced, had
a chronic illness, were homeless, had neglected or
abused the child, were deployed in the military, or
had died. While most grandparents state they gain
great joy from raising their grandchildren, they also
face greater financial, health, education, and housing
challenges that often derail their retirement plans than
do grandparents who do not have primary
responsibility for raising their grandchildren.

Social Networks in Late Adulthood
A person’s social network consists of the people with whom one is directly involved, such as
family, friends, and acquaintances (Fischer, 1982). As individuals age, changes occur in these
social networks, and The Convoy Model of Social Relations and Socioemotional Selectivity
Theory address these changes (Wrzus, Hanel, Wagner, & Neyer, 2013). Both theories indicate
that less close relationships will decrease as one ages, while close relationships will persist.
However, the two theories differ in explaining why this occurs.
The Convoy Model of Social Relations suggests that the social connections that people
accumulate differ in levels of closeness and are held together by exchanges in social support
(Antonucci, 2001; Kahn & Antonucci, 1980). According to the Convoy Model, relationships
with a spouse and family members, people in the innermost circle of the convoy, should remain
stable throughout the lifespan. In contrast, coworkers, neighbors, and acquaintances, people in
the periphery of the convoy, should be less stable. These peripheral relationships may end due to
changes in jobs, social roles, location, or other life events. These relationships are more
vulnerable to changing situations than family relationships. Therefore, the frequency, type, and
reciprocity of the social exchanges with peripheral relationships decrease with age.
The Socioemotional Selectivity Theory focuses on changes in motivation for actively seeking
social contact with others (Carstensen, 1993; Carstensen, Isaacowitz & Charles, 1999). This
theory proposes that with increasing age, our motivational goals change based on how much time
one has left to live. Rather than focusing on acquiring information from many diverse social
relationships, as noted with adolescents and young adults, older adults focus on the emotional
aspects of relationships. To optimize the experience of positive affect, older adults actively
restrict their social life to prioritize time spent with emotionally close significant others. In line
with this theory, older marriages are found to be characterized by enhanced positive and reduced
negative interactions and older partners show more affectionate behavior during conflict
discussions than do middle-aged partners (Carstensen, Gottman, & Levenson, 1995). Research
showing that older adults have smaller networks compared to young adults, and tend to avoid
negative interactions, also supports this theory.
416

Relationship with Adult Children: Many older
Figure 9.44
adults provide financial assistance and/or housing
to adult children. There is more support going
from the older parent to the younger adult children
than in the other direction (Fingerman & Birditt,
2011). In addition to providing for their own
children, many elders are raising their
grandchildren. Consistent with socioemotional
selectivity theory, older adults seek, and are helped
by, their adult children providing emotional
Source
support (Lang & Schütze, 2002). Lang and
Schütze, as part of the Berlin Aging Study
(BASE), surveyed adult children (mean age 54) and their aging parents (mean age 84). They
found that the older parents of adult children who provided emotional support, such as showing
tenderness toward their parent, cheering the parent up when he or she was sad, tended to report
greater life satisfaction. In contrast, older adults whose children provided informational support,
such as providing advice to the parent, reported less life satisfaction. Lang and Schütze found
that older adults wanted their relationship with their children to be more emotionally meaningful.
Daughters and adult children who were younger, tended to provide such support more than sons
and adult children who were older. Lang and Schütze also found that adult children who were
more autonomous rather than emotionally dependent on their parents, had more emotionally
meaningful relationships with their parents, from both the parents’ and adult children’s point of
view.
Friendships: Friendships are not formed in order to enhance status or careers, and may be based
purely on a sense of connection or the enjoyment of being together. Most elderly people have at
least one close friend. These friends may provide emotional as well as physical support. Being
able to talk with friends and rely on others is very important during this stage of life. Bookwala,
Marshall, and Manning (2014) found that the availability of a friend played a significant role in
protecting the health from the impact of widowhood. Specifically, those who became widowed
and had a friend as a confidante, reported significantly lower somatic depressive symptoms,
better self-rated health, and fewer sick days in bed than those who reported not having a friend as
a confidante. In contrast, having a family member as a confidante did not provide health
protection for those recently widowed.
Loneliness or Solitude: Loneliness is the discrepancy between the social contact a person has
and the contacts a person wants (Brehm, Miller, Perlman, & Campbell, 2002). It can result from
social or emotional isolation. Women tend to experience loneliness due to social isolation; men
from emotional isolation. Loneliness can be accompanied by a lack of self-worth, impatience,
desperation, and depression. Being alone does not always result in loneliness. For some, it means
solitude. Solitude involves gaining self-awareness, taking care of the self, being comfortable
alone, and pursuing one’s interests (Brehm et al., 2002). In contrast, loneliness is perceived
social isolation.
For those in late adulthood, loneliness can be especially detrimental. Novotney (2019) reviewed
the research on loneliness and social isolation and found that loneliness was linked to a 40%
417

increase in a risk for dementia and a 30% increase in the risk of stroke or coronary heart disease.
This was hypothesized to be due to a rise in stress hormones, depression, and anxiety, as well as
the individual lacking encouragement from others to engage in healthy behaviors. In contrast,
older adults who take part in social clubs and church groups have a lower risk of death.
Opportunities to reside in mixed age housing and continuing to feel like a productive member of
society have also been found to decrease feelings of social isolation, and thus loneliness.

Late Adult Lifestyles

Marriage: As can be
seen in Figure 9.45,
the most common
living arrangement
for older adults in
2015 was marriage
(AOA, 2017).

more common for
older men.

Widowhood: Losing
one’s spouse is one
of the most difficult
transitions in life.
The Social
Source
Readjustment Rating
Scale, commonly
known as the Holmes-Rahe Stress Inventory, rates the death of a spouse as the most significant
stressor (Holmes & Rahe, 1967). The loss of a spouse after many years of marriage may make an
older adult feel adrift in life. They must remake their identity after years of seeing themselves as
a husband or wife. Approximately, 1 in 3 women aged 65 and older are widowed, compared
with about 1 in 10 men.
Loneliness is the biggest challenge for those who have lost their spouse (Kowalski & Bondmass,
2008). However, several factors can influence how well someone adjusts to this event. Older
adults who are more extroverted (McCrae & Costa, 1988) and have higher self-efficacy, (Carr,
2004b) often fare better. Positive support from adult children is also associated with fewer
symptoms of depression and better adjustment in the months following widowhood (Ha, 2010).
The context of the death is also an important factor in how people may react to the death of a
spouse. The stress of caring for an ill spouse can result in a mixed blessing when the ill partner
dies (Erber & Szchman, 2015). The death of a spouse who died after a lengthy illness may come
as a relief for the surviving spouse, who may have had the pressure of providing care for
someone who was increasingly less able to care for themselves. At the same time, this sense of
relief may be intermingled with guilt for feeling relief at the passing of their spouse. The
emotional issues of grief are complex and will be discussed in more detail in chapter 10.
418

Widowhood also poses health risks. The widowhood mortality effect refers to the higher risk
of death after the death of a spouse (Sullivan & Fenelon, 2014). Subramanian, Elwert, and
Christakis (2008) found that widowhood increases the risk of dying from almost all causes.
However, research suggests that the predictability of the spouse’s death plays an important role
in the relationship between widowhood and mortality. Elwert and Christakis (2008) found that
the rate of mortality for windows and widowers was lower if they had time to prepare for the
death of their spouse, such as in the case of a terminal illness like Parkinson’s or Alzheimer’s.
Another factor that influences the risk of mortality is gender. Men show a higher risk of
mortality following the death of their spouse if they have higher health problems (Bennett,
Hughes, & Smith, 2005). In addition, widowers have a higher risk of suicide than do widows
(Ruckenhauser, Yazdani, & Ravaglia, 2007).
Divorce: As noted in Chapter 8, older adults are divorcing at
Figure 9.46
higher rates than in prior generations. However, adults age
65 and over are still less likely to divorce than middle-aged
and young adults (Wu & Schimmele, 2007). Divorce poses
a number of challenges for older adults, especially women,
who are more likely to experience financial difficulties and
are more likely to remain single than are older men
(McDonald & Robb, 2004). However, in both America (Lin,
2008) and England (Glaser, Stuchbury, Tomassini, &
Askham, 2008) studies have found that the adult children of
divorced parents offer more support and care to their
Source
mothers than their fathers. While divorced, older men may
be better off financially and are more likely to find another
partner, they may receive less support from their adult children.
Dating: Due to changing social norms and shifting cohort demographics, it has become more
common for single older adults to be involved in dating and romantic relationships (Alterovitz &
Mendelsohn, 2011). An analysis of widows and widowers ages 65 and older found that 18
months after the death of a spouse, 37% of men and 15% of women were interested in dating
(Carr, 2004a). Unfortunately, opportunities to develop close relationships often diminish in later
life as social networks decrease because of retirement, relocation, and the death of friends and
loved ones (de Vries, 1996). Consequently, older adults, much like those younger, are increasing
their social networks using technologies, including e-mail, chat rooms, and online dating sites
(Fox, 2004; Wright & Query, 2004; Papernow, 2018).
Interestingly, older men and women parallel online dating information as those younger.
Alterovitz and Mendelsohn (2011) analyzed 600 internet personal ads from different age groups,
and across the life span, men sought physical attractiveness and offered status related
information more than women. With advanced age, men desired women increasingly younger
than themselves, whereas women desired older men until ages 75 and over, when they sought
men younger than themselves. Research has previously shown that older women in romantic
relationships are not interested in becoming a caregiver or becoming widowed for a second time
(Carr, 2004a). Additionally, older men are more eager to repartner than are older women
(Davidson, 2001; Erber & Szuchman, 2015). Concerns expressed by older women included not
419

wanting to lose their autonomy, care for a potentially ill partner, or merge their finances with
someone (Watson & Stelle, 2011).
Older dating adults also need to know about threats to sexual health, including being at risk for
sexually transmitted diseases, including chlamydia, genital herpes, and HIV. Nearly 25% of
people living with HIV/AIDS in the United States are 50 or older (Office on Women’s Health,
2010b). Githens and Abramsohn (2010) found that only 25% of adults 50 and over who were
single or had a new sexual partner used a condom the last time they had sex. Robin (2010) stated
that 40% of those 50 and over have never been tested for HIV. These results indicated that
educating all individuals, not just adolescents, on healthy sexual behavior is important.
Remarriage and Cohabitation: Older adults who remarry often find that their remarriages are
more stable than those of younger adults. Kemp and Kemp (2002) suggest that greater emotional
maturity may lead to more realistic expectations regarding marital relationships, leading to
greater stability in remarriages in later life. Older adults are also more likely to be seeking
companionship in their romantic relationships. Carr (2004a) found that older adults who have
considerable emotional support from their friends were less likely to seek romantic relationships.
In addition, older adults who have divorced often desire the companionship of intimate
relationships without marriage. As a result, cohabitation is increasing among older adults, and
like remarriage, cohabitation in later adulthood is often associated with more positive
consequences than it is in younger age groups (King & Scott, 2005). No longer being interested
in raising children, and perhaps wishing to protect family wealth, older adults may see
cohabitation as a good alternative to marriage. In 2014, 2% of adults age 65 and up were
cohabitating (Stepler, 2016b).
Living Apart Together: In addition to cohabiting there has been an increase in living apart
together (LAT), which is “a monogamous intimate partnership between unmarried individuals
who live in separate homes but identify themselves as a committed couple” (Benson & Coleman,
2016, p. 797). This trend has been found in several nations and is motivated by:
•
•
•
•

A strong desire to be independent in day-to-day decisions
Maintaining their own home
Keeping boundaries around established relationships
Maintaining financial stability

Besides the desire to be autonomous, there is also a need for companionship, sexual intimacy,
and emotional support. According to Bensen and Coleman, there are differences in LAT among
older and younger adults. Those who are younger often enter into LAT out of circumstances,
such as the job market, and they frequently view this arrangement as a transitional stage. In
contrast, 80% older adults reported that they did not wish to cohabitate or marry. For some it
was a conscious choice to live more independently. For instance, older women desired the LAT
lifestyle as a way of avoiding the traditional gender roles that are often inherent in relationships
where the couple lives together. However, some older adults become LATs because they fear
social disapproval from others if they were to live together.

Gay and Lesbian Elders
Approximately 3 million older adults in the United States identify as lesbian or gay (Hillman &
Hinrichsen, 2014). By 2025 that number is expected to rise to more than 7 million (National
Gay and Lesbian Task Force, 2006). Despite the increase in numbers, older lesbian and gay
adults are one of the least researched demographic groups, and the research there is portrays a
population faced with discrimination. According to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (2011), compared to heterosexuals, lesbian and gay adults experience both physical
and mental health differences. More than 40% of lesbian and gay adults ages 50 and over suffer
from at least one chronic illness or disability and compared to heterosexuals they are more likely
to smoke and binge drink (Hillman & Hinrichsen, 2014). Additionally, gay older adults have an
increased risk of prostate cancer (Blank, 2005) and infection from HIV and other sexually
transmitted illnesses (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2008). When compared to
heterosexuals, lesbian and gay elders have less support from others as they are twice as likely to
live alone and four times less likely to have adult children (Hillman & Hinrichsen, 2014).
Lesbian and gay older adults who belong to ethnic and cultural minorities, conservative
religions, and rural communities may face additional stressors. Ageism, heterocentrism, sexism,
and racism can combine cumulatively and impact the older adult beyond the negative impact of
each individual form of discrimination (Hillman & Hinrichsen, 2014). David and Knight (2008)
found that older gay black men reported higher rates of racism than younger gay black men and
higher levels of perceived ageism than older gay white men.
LGBT Elder Care: Approximately 7 million LGBT people over age 50 will reside in the United
States by 2030, and 4.7 million of them will need elder care. Decisions regarding elder care is
often left for families, and because many LGBT people are estranged from their families, they
are left in a vulnerable position when seeking living arrangements (Alleccia & Bailey, 2019). A
history of discriminatory policies, such as housing restricted to married individuals involving one
man and one woman, and stigma associated with LGBT people make them especially vulnerable
to negative housing experiences when looking for elder care.
Although lesbian and gay older adults face many
challenges, more than 80% indicate that they
engage in some form of wellness or spiritual
activity (Fredrickson-Goldsen et al., 2011). They
also gather social support from friends and
“family members by choice” rather than legal or
biological relatives (Hillman & Hinrichsen, 2014).
This broader social network provides extra
support to gay and lesbian elders.
An important consideration when reviewing the
development of gay and lesbian older adults is the
cohort in which they grew up (Hillman &
Hinrichsen, 2014). The oldest lesbian and gay
adults came of age in the 1950s when there were
421

no laws to protect them from victimization. The baby boomers, who grew up in the 1960s and
1970s, began to see states repeal laws that criminalized homosexual behavior. Future lesbian
and gay elders will have different experiences due to the legal right for same-sex marriage and
greater societal acceptance. Consequently, just like all those in late adulthood, understanding that
gay and lesbian elders are a heterogeneous population is important when understanding their
overall development.

Elder Abuse
Current research indicates that at least 1 in 10, or approximately 4.3 million, older Americans are
affected by at least one form of elder abuse per year (Roberto, 2016). Those between 60 and 69
years of age are more susceptible than those older. This may be because younger older adults
more often live with adult children or a spouse, two groups with the most likely abusers.
Cognitive impairment, including confusion and communication deficits, is the greatest risk factor
for elder abuse, while a decline in overall health resulting in greater dependency on others is
another. Having a disability also places an elder at a higher risk for abuse (Youdin, 2016).
Definitions of elder abuse typically recognize five types of abuse as shown in Table 9.8
Consequences of elder abuse are significant and include injuries, new or exacerbated health
conditions, hospitalizations, premature institutionalization, and early death (Roberto, 2016).
Psychological and emotional abuse is considered the most common form, even though it is
underreported and may go unrecognized by the elder. Continual emotional mistreatment is very
damaging as it becomes internalized and results in late-life emotional problems and impairment.
Financial abuse and exploitation is increasing and costs seniors nearly 3 billion dollars per year
(Lichtenberg, 2016). Financial abuse is the second most common form after emotional abuse
and affects approximately 5% of elders. Abuse and neglect occurring in a nursing home is
estimated to be 25%-30% (Youdin, 2016). Abuse of nursing home residents is more often found
in facilities that are run down and understaffed

Adapted from Roberto (2016)

Older women are more likely to be victims than men, and one reason is due to women living
longer. Additionally, a family history of violence makes older women more vulnerable,
especially for physical and sexual abuse (Acierno et al., 2010). However, Kosberg (2014) found
that men were less likely to report abuse. Recent research indicated no differences among ethnic
groups in abuse prevalence, however, cultural norms regarding what constitutes abuse differ
based on ethnicity. For example, Dakin and Pearlmutter found that working class White women
422

did not consider verbal abuse as elder abuse, and higher socioeconomic status African American
and White women did not consider financial abuse as a form of elder abuse (as cited in Roberto,
2016, p. 304).
Perpetrators of elder abuse are typically family members and include spouses/partners and older
children (Roberto, 2016). Children who are abusive tend to be dependent on their parents for
financial, housing, and emotional support. Substance use, mental illness, and chronic
unemployment increase dependency on parents, which can then increase the possibility of elder
abuse. Prosecuting a family member who has financially abused a parent is very difficult. The
victim may be reluctant to press charges and the court dockets are often very full resulting in
long waits before a case is heard. According to Tanne, family members abandoning older family
members with severe disabilities in emergency rooms is a growing problem as an estimated
100,000 are dumped each year (as cited in Berk, 2007). Paid caregivers and professionals trusted
to make decisions on behalf of an elder, such as guardians and lawyers, also perpetuate abuse.
When elders feel they have social support and are engaged with others, they are less likely to
suffer abuse.

Substance Abuse and the Elderly
Alcohol and drug problems, particularly prescription drug abuse, have become a serious health
concern among older adults. Although people 65 years of age and older make up only 13% of
the population, they account for almost 30% of all medications prescribed in the United States.
According to the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence (NCADD) (2015), the
following statistics illustrate the significance of substance abuse for those in late adulthood:
•
•

•
•
•
•

There are 2.5 million older adults with an alcohol or drug problem.
Six to eleven percent of elderly hospital admissions, 14 percent of elderly emergency room
admissions, and 20 percent of elderly psychiatric hospital admissions are a result of alcohol
or drug problems.
Widowers over the age of 75 have the highest rate of alcoholism in the U.S.
Nearly 50 percent of nursing home residents have alcohol related problems.
Older adults are hospitalized as often for alcoholic related problems as for heart attacks.
Nearly 17 million prescriptions for tranquilizers are prescribed for older adults each year.
Benzodiazepines, a type of tranquilizing drug, are the most commonly misused and abused
prescription medications.

Risk factors for psychoactive substance abuse in older adults include social isolation, which can
lead to depression (Youdin, 2016). This can be caused by the death of a spouse/partner, family
members and/or friends, retirement, moving, and reduced activity levels. Additionally, medical
conditions, chronic pain, anxiety, and stress can all lead to the abuse of substances.
Diagnosis Difficulties: Using criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Disorder-5th
Edition (American Psychiatric Association, 2013), diagnosing older adults with a substance use
disorder can be difficult (Youdin, 2016). For example, compared to adolescents and younger
adults, older adults are not looking to get high, but rather become dependent by accident.
Additionally, stereotypes of older adults, which include memory deficits, confusion, depression,
agitation, motor problems, and hostility, can result in a diagnosis of cognitive impairment instead
423

of a substance use disorder. Further, a diagnosis of a substance use disorder involves impairment
in work, school, or home obligations, and because older adults are not typically working, in
school or caring for children, these impairments would not be exhibited. Stigma and shame
about use, as well as the belief that one’s use is a private matter, may keep older adults from
seeking assistance. Lastly, physicians may be biased against asking those in late adulthood if
they have a problem with drugs or alcohol (NCADD, 2015).
Abused Substances: Drugs of choice for older
adults include alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioid
prescription medications and marijuana. The
abuse of prescription medications is expected to
increase significantly. Siriwardena, Qureshi,
Gibson, Collier, and Lathamn (2006) found that
family physicians prescribe benzodiazepines and
opioids to older adults to deal with psychosocial
and pain problems rather than prescribe
alternatives to medication such as therapy. Those
in late adulthood are also more sensitive to the
effects of alcohol than those younger because of
Source
an age-related decrease in the ratio between lean
body mass and fat (Erber & Szuchman, 2015).
Additionally, “liver enzymes that metabolize alcohol become less efficient with age and central
nervous system sensitivity to drugs increase with age” (p.134). Those in late adulthood are also
more likely to be taking other medications, and this can result in unpredictable interactions with
the psychoactive substances (Youdin, 2016).
Figure 9.48

Cannabis Use: Blazer and Wu (2009) found that adults aged 50-64 were more likely to use
cannabis than older adults. These “baby boomers” with the highest cannabis use included men,
those unmarried/unpartnered, and those with depression. In contrast to the negative effects of
cannabis, which include panic reactions, anxiety, perceptual distortions and exacerbation of
mood and psychotic disorders, cannabis can provide benefit to the older adult with medical
conditions (Youdin, 2016). For example, cannabis can be used in the treatment for multiple
sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, chronic pain, and the fatigue and nausea from the effects of
chemotherapy (Williamson & Evans, 2000).
Future Substance Abuse Concerns: There will be an increase in the number of seniors abusing
substances in the future because the baby boomer generation has a history of having been
exposed to, and having experienced, psychoactive substance use over their adult life. This is a
significant difference from the current and previous generations of older adults (National
Institutes of Health, 2014c). Efforts will be needed to adequately address these future substance
abuse issues for the elderly due to both the health risks for them and the expected burden on the
health care system.

Successful Aging
Although definitions of successful aging are value-laden, Rowe and Kahn (1997) defined three
criteria of successful aging that are useful for research and behavioral interventions.
424

They include:
• Relative avoidance of disease, disability, and risk factors, like high blood pressure,
smoking, or obesity
• Maintenance of high physical and cognitive functioning
• Active engagement in social and productive activities
For example, research has demonstrated that age-related declines in cognitive functioning across
the adult life span may be slowed through physical exercise and lifestyle interventions (Kramer
& Erickson, 2007).
Another way that older adults can respond to the challenges of aging is through compensation.
Specifically, selective optimization with compensation is used when the elder makes
adjustments, as needed, in order to continue living as independently and actively as possible
(Baltes & Dickson, 2001). When older adults lose functioning, referred to as loss-based
selection, they may first use new resources/technologies or continually practice tasks to maintain
their skills. However, when tasks become too difficult, they may compensate by choosing other
ways to achieve their goals. For example, a person who can no longer drive needs to find
alternative transportation, or a person who is compensating for having less energy, learns how to
reorganize the daily routine to avoid over-exertion.

Chapter 10: Death and Dying
We have now reached the end of the lifespan. While it is true that death occurs more commonly
at the later stages of age, death can occur at any point in the life cycle. Death is a deeply
personal experience evoking many different reactions, emotions, and perceptions. Children and
young adults in their prime of life may perceive death differently from adults dealing with
chronic illness or the increasing frequency of the death of family and friends. If asked, most
people envision their death as quick and peaceful. However, except for a handful of illnesses in
which death does often quickly follow diagnosis, or in the case of accidents or trauma, most
deaths come after a lengthy period of chronic illness or frailty (Institute of Medicine (IOM),
2015). While modern medicine and better living conditions have led to a rise in life expectancy
around the world, death will still be the inevitable final chapter of our lives.

Death Defined
One way to understand death and dying is to look more closely at what defines physical death
and social death. According to the Uniform Determination of Death Act (UDDA) (Uniform Law
Commissioners, 1980), death is defined clinically as the following:
An individual who has sustained either (1) irreversible cessation of circulatory and
respiratory functions, or (2) irreversible cessation of all functions of the entire brain,
including the brain stem, is dead. A determination of death must be made in accordance
with accepted medical standards.
The UDDA was approved for the United States in 1980 by a committee of national
commissioners, the American Medical Association, the American Bar Association, and the
President’s Commission on Medical Ethics. This act has since been adopted by most states and
provides a comprehensive and medically factual basis for determining death in all situations.
Death Process: For those individuals who are terminal, and death is expected, a series of
physical changes occur. Bell (2010) identifies some of the major changes that occur in the
weeks, days, and hours leading up to death:
•

Weeks Before Passing
• Minimal appetite; prefer easily digested foods
• Increase in the need for sleep
• Increased weakness
• Incontinence of bladder and/or bowel
• Restlessness or disorientation
• Increased need for assistance with care

•

Days Before Passing
• Decreased level of consciousness
• Pauses in breathing
• Decreased blood pressure
• Decreased urine volume and urine color darkens
• Murmuring to people others cannot see
• Reaching in air or picking at covers
• Need for assistance with all care

•

Days to Hours Before Passing
• Decreased level of consciousness or comatose-like state
• Inability to swallow
• Pauses in breathing become longer
• Shallow breaths
• Weak or absent pulse
• Knees, feet, and/or hands becoming cool or cold
• Knees, feet, and/or hand discoloring to purplish hue
• Noisy breathing due to relaxed throat muscles, often called a “death rattle”
• Skin coloring becoming pale, waxen (pp. 5, 176-177)
439

Social death begins much earlier than physical death (Pattison,
Figure 10.1
1977). Social death occurs when others begin to dehumanize and
HIV/AIDS Awareness
withdraw from someone who is terminally ill or has been
diagnosed with a terminal illness (Glaser & Strauss, 1966).
Dehumanization includes ignoring them, talking about them if they
were not present, making decisions without consulting them first,
and forcing unwanted procedures. Sweeting and Gilhooly (1997)
further identified older people in general, and people with a loss of
personhood, as having the characteristics necessary to be treated as
socially dead. More recently, the concept has been used to
describe the exclusion of people with HIV/AIDS, younger people
living with terminal illness, and the preference to die at home
(Brannelly, 2011). Those diagnosed with conditions such as AIDS
or cancer may find that friends, family members, and even health
Source
care professionals begin to say less and visit less frequently.
Meaningful discussions may be replaced with comments about the
weather or other topics of light conversation. Doctors may spend less time with patients after
their prognosis becomes poor.
Why do others begin to withdraw? Friends and family members may feel that they do not know
what to say or that they can offer no solutions to relieve suffering. They withdraw to protect
themselves against feeling inadequate or from having to face the reality of death. Health
professionals, trained to heal, may also feel inadequate and uncomfortable facing decline and
death. People in nursing homes may live as socially dead for years with no one visiting or
calling. Social support is important for quality of life, and those who experience social death are
deprived from the benefits that come from loving interaction with others (Bell, 2010).
Why would younger or healthier people dehumanize those who are incapacitated, older, or
unwell? One explanation is that dehumanization is the result of the healthier person placing a
protective distance between themselves and the incapacitated, older, or unwell person
(Brannelly, 2011). This keeps the well person from thinking of themselves as becoming ill or in
need of assistance. Another explanation is the repeated experience of loss that paid caregivers
experience when working with terminally ill and older people requires a distance which protects
against continual grief and sadness, and possibly even burnout.

Most Common Causes of Death
The World: The most recent statistics analyzed by the World Health Organization were in 2016
(WHO, 2018) and non-communicable deaths; that is, those not passed from person-to-person,
were responsible for the majority of deaths (see Figure 10.2). The three most common
noncommunicable diseases were heart disease, stroke, and COPD. Tobacco use is attributed as
one of the top killers and is often the hidden cause behind many of the diseases that result in
death, such as heart disease and chronic lung diseases.

440

Figure 10. 2

These statistics hide the differences in the causes of death among high versus low income
nations. In high-income countries, defined as having a per capita annual income of $12,476 or
more, 70% of deaths are among people aged 70 and older. Only 1% of deaths occur in children
under 15 years of age. People predominantly die of chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular
disease, cancers, dementia, or diabetes. Lower respiratory infections remain the only leading
infectious cause of death in such nations. In contrast, in low-income countries, defined as
having a per capital annual income of $1025 or less, almost 40% of deaths are among children
under age 15, and only 20% of deaths are among people aged 70 years and older. People
predominantly die of infectious diseases such as lower respiratory infections, HIV/AIDS,
diarrheal diseases, malaria and tuberculosis. These account for almost one third of all deaths in
these countries. Complications of childbirth due to prematurity, birth asphyxia, and birth trauma
are among the leading causes of death for newborns and infants in the poorest of nations (WHO,
2018).
The United States: In 1900, the most common causes of death were infectious diseases, which
brought death quickly. Today, the most common causes of death are chronic diseases in which a
slow and steady decline in health ultimately results in death. In 2016, heart disease, cancer, and
accidents were the leading causes of death (see Figure 10.3, The Advisory Board, 2018)

441

Figure 10.3

Source

The causes of death vary by age (see Figure 10.4 and 10.5, Heron, 2018). Prior to age 1, SIDS,
congenital problems, and other birth complications are the largest contributors to infant
mortality. Accidents, known as unintentional injury, become the leading cause of death
throughout childhood and into middle adulthood. In later middle adulthood and late adulthood
heart disease, cancer and other medical conditions become the leading killers.

Chapters 8 and 9 discussed the chronic conditions that are associated with dying at later stages in
life. However, suicides and drug overdoses are currently claiming lives throughout the lifespan,
and consequently will be discussed next.

Suicide
According to the latest research from the CDC (Hedegaard, Curtin, & Warner, 2018), the suicide
rate increased 33% from 1999 through 2017. In the United States, suicide is the 10th leading
cause of death overall, but it ranks as the 2nd leading cause of death for those 10-34 and the 4th
leading cause for those aged 35-54 (Weir, 2019). Overall, approximately 45, 0000 people died by
suicide in 2016 (CDC, 2018). Suicide rates have risen for all racial and ethnic groups and
increased in every state, except for Nevada which was already high. Further, the suicide rate for
the most rural counties (20.0 per 100,000) is higher than the most urban counties (11.1 per
100,000) (Hedegaard et al., 2018).

443

Suicide and Gender: Suicide
rates increased for both males
and females, especially after
2006. For males, the rate
increased 26% from 17.8 per
100,000 males in 1999 to 22.4
per 100,000 in 2017. For
females, the rate increased 53%
from 4.0 per 100,000 females in
1999 to 6.1 per 100,000 in 2017
(see Figure 10.6).

Figure 10.6 Suicide Rate from 1999-2017

By ages, suicide rates for
females in 2017 were higher for
every age group, except those
aged 75 and older. The highest
female rates were for those aged
Source
45–64. In contrast, men aged 75
and older had the highest rates,
although the rate for older males had decreased from 1999 (see Figures 10.7 and 10.8).
Males have consistently demonstrated higher rates of suicide as they typically experience higher
rates of substance use disorders, do not seek out mental health treatment, and use more lethal
means. However, females are now closing the suicide gap with males, as females are now
responding to the stress in their lives through self-harm, substance abuse, and risk taking
behaviors (Healy, 2019). Females who identify pain, depression, and anxiety are especially at
risk in middle age.

Deaths of Despair: While the suicide rate has increased in America, during the same period it
has gone down in other countries, including Canada, Japan, China, Russia, United Kingdom,
Germany, and most of Western Europe. Globally, suicide rates have fallen when the living
conditions have improved (Weir, 2019). Not surprisingly, the opposite is true, and thus a
decrease in economic and social well-being, referred to as deaths of despair, has been linked to
suicides in America. The loss of farming and manufacturing jobs are believed to have
contributed to these deaths of despair, especially in rural communities where there is less access
to mental health treatment. According to the CDC (2018), other factors that contributed to
suicide among those with and without mental health conditions included relationship problems,
substance use disorders, financial or legal problems, and health concerns (see Figure 10.9).
Figure 10.9 Reasons Given for Suicide

445

Prevention: Globally, limiting access to
lethal means has contributed to a decrease Figure 10.10 CDC’s 12 Warning Signs of
Suicide
in suicide rates (Weir, 2019). For

programs are being designed to address
Source
the stressors associated with these jobs.
Knowing the warning signs of suicide
and encouraging someone to get treatment are things that everyone can do to address the increase
in the suicide rate (see Figure 10.10).

Fatal Drug Overdoses
Another factor linked to the
Figure 10.11 U.S. Drug Overdose Death Rates: 1999–
deaths of despair has been
2017
fatal drug overdoses. In 2017,
deaths from fatal drug
overdoses in the United States
equaled 70,237 (Hedegaard,
Miniño, & Warner, 2018).
The rate of drug overdose
deaths has been steadily
increasing since 1999, and in
2017 the rate (21.7/100,000)
was 9.6% higher than the rate
in 2016 (19.8/100,000) (see
Figure 10.11). Unlike suicide
rates, deaths from overdoses
occur equally among those
living in urban and rural
areas. The rate of drug overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids other than methadone (drugs
such as fentanyl, fentanyl analogs, and tramadol) increased by 45% between 2016 and 2017,
from 6.2 to 9.0 per 100,000 (see Figure 10.12). Fetanyl is an especially powerful opioid that can
easily lead to a fatal overdose. Because it is synthetic, it is cheap to make and easier to conceal
than heroin.

446

Figure 10.12

Where do People Die?
Gathering statistics on the location of death is not a simple matter. Those with terminal illnesses
may be going through the process of dying at home or in a nursing home, only to be transported
to a hospital in the final hours of their life. According to the Stanford Medical School (2019),
most Americans (80%) would prefer to die at home, however:
•
•
•

60% of Americans die in acute care hospitals
20% in nursing homes
20% at home.

While dying at home is not favored in certain cultures, and some patients may prefer to die in a
hospital, the results indicate that less people are dying at home than want to.
Internationally, 54% of deaths in over 45 nations occurred in hospitals, with the most frequent
occurring in Japan (78%) and the least frequent occurring in China (20%), according to a study
by Broad et al. (2013). They also found that for older adults, 18% of deaths occurred in some
form of residential care, such as nursing homes, and that for each decade after age 65, the rate of
dying in a such settings increased 10%. In addition, the number of women dying in residential
care was considerably higher than for males.

447

Developmental Perceptions of Death and Death Anxiety
The concept of death changes as we develop from early childhood to late adulthood. Cognitive
development, societal beliefs, familial responsibilities, and personal experiences all shape an
individual’s view of death (Batts, 2004; Erber & Szuchman, 2015; National Cancer Institute,
2013).
Infancy: Certainly, infants do not comprehend death, however, they do react to the separation
caused by death. Infants separated from their mothers may become sluggish and quiet, no longer
smile or coo, sleep less, and develop physical symptoms such as weight loss.
Early Childhood: As you recall from Piaget’s preoperational stage of cognitive development,
young children experience difficulty distinguishing reality from fantasy. It is therefore not
surprising that young children lack an understanding of death. They do not see death as
permanent, assume it is temporary or reversible, think the person is sleeping, and believe they
can wish the person back to life. Additionally, they feel they may have caused the death through
their actions, such as misbehavior, words, and feelings.
Middle Childhood: Although children in middle childhood begin to
understand the finality of death, up until the age of 9 they may still
participate in magical thinking and believe that through their
thoughts they can bring someone back to life. They also may think
that they could have prevented the death in some way, and
consequently feel guilty and responsible for the death.
Late Childhood: At this stage, children understand the finality of
death and know that everyone will die, including themselves.
However, they may also think people die because of some wrong
doing on the part of the deceased. They may develop fears of their
parents dying and continue to feel guilty if a loved one dies.

Figure 10.13

Adolescence: Adolescents understand death as well as adults. With
formal operational thinking, adolescents can now think abstractly about death, philosophize
about it, and ponder their own lack of existence. Some adolescents become fascinated with
death and reflect on their own funeral by fantasizing on how others will feel and react. Despite a
preoccupation with thoughts of death, the personal fable of adolescence causes them to feel
immune to the death. Consequently, they often engage in risky behaviors, such as substance use,
unsafe sexual behavior, and reckless driving thinking they are invincible.
Early Adulthood: In adulthood, there are differences in the level of fear and anxiety concerning
death experienced by those in different age groups. For those in early adulthood, their overall
lower rate of death is a significant factor in their lower rates of death anxiety. Individuals in
early adulthood typically expect a long life ahead of them, and consequently do not think about,
nor worry about death.

448

Middle Adulthood: Those in middle adulthood report more fear of death than those in either
early and late adulthood. The caretaking responsibilities for those in middle adulthood is a
significant factor in their fears. As mentioned previously, middle adults often provide assistance
for both their children and parents, and they feel anxiety about leaving them to care for
themselves.
Late Adulthood: Contrary to the belief that because they are so close to death, they must fear
death, those in late adulthood have lower fears of death than other adults. Why would this
occur? First, older adults have fewer caregiving responsibilities and are not worried about
leaving family members on their own. They also have had more time to complete activities they
had planned in their lives, and they realize that the future will not provide as many opportunities
for them. Additionally, they have less anxiety because they have already experienced the death
of loved ones and have become accustomed to the likelihood of death. It is not death itself that
concerns those in late adulthood; rather, it is having control over how they die.

Curative, Palliative, and Hospice Care
When individuals become ill, they need to make choices about the treatment they wish to
receive. One’s age, type of illness, and personal beliefs about dying affect the type of treatment
chosen (Bell, 2010).
Curative care is designed to overcome and cure disease and illness (Fox, 1997). Its aim is to
promote complete recovery, not just to reduce symptoms or pain. An example of curative care
would be chemotherapy. While curing illness and disease is an important goal of medicine, it is
not its only goal. As a result, some have criticized the curative model as ignoring the other goals
of medicine, including preventing illness, restoring functional capacity, relieving suffering, and
caring for those who cannot be cured.
Palliative care focuses on providing comfort and relief from physical and emotional pain to
patients throughout their illness, even while being treated (NIH, 2007). In the past, palliative
care was confined to offering comfort for the dying. Now it is offered whenever patients suffer
from chronic illnesses, such as cancer or heart disease (IOM, 2015). Palliative care is also part of
hospice programs.
Hospice emerged in the United Kingdom in the mid-20th century as a result of the work of Cicely
Saunders. This approach became popularized in the U.S. by the work of Elizabeth Kübler-Ross
(IOM, 2015), and by 2012 there were 5,500 hospice programs in the U.S. (National Hospice and
Palliative Care Organization (NHPCO), 2013).
Hospice care whether at home, in a hospital, nursing home, or hospice facility involves a team of
professionals and volunteers who provide terminally ill patients with medical, psychological,
and spiritual support, along with support for their families (Shannon, 2006). The aim of hospice
is to help the dying be as free from pain as possible, and to comfort both the patients and their
families during a difficult time.

449

In order to enter hospice, a patient must be diagnosed
as terminally ill with an anticipated death within 6
months (IOM, 2015). The patient is allowed to go
through the dying process without invasive
treatments. Hospice workers try to inform the family
of what to expect and reassure them that much of
what they see is a normal part of the dying process.
According to the National Hospice and Palliative
Care Organization (2019) there are four types of
hospice care in America:
•

Routine hospice care, where the patient has chosen to receive hospice care at home, is the
most common form of hospice.
Continuous home care is predominantly nursing care, with caregiver and hospice aides
supplementing this care, to manage pain and acute symptom crises for 8 to 24 hours in
the home.
Inpatient respite care is provided by a hospital, hospice, or long-term care facility to
provide temporary relief for family caregivers.
General inpatient care is provided by a hospital, hospice, or long-term care facility when
pain and acute symptom management can on be handled in other settings.

In 2017, an estimated 1.5 million people resideing in American received hospice care (NHPCO,
2019). The majority of patients on hospice were patients suffering from dementia, heart disease,
or cancer, and typically did not enter hospice until the last few weeks prior to death. Almost one
out of three patients were on hospice for less than a week.
According to Shannon (2006), the basic elements of hospice include:
• Care of the patient and family as a single unit
• Pain and symptom management for the patient
• Having access to day and night care
• Coordination of all medical services
• Social work, counseling, and pastoral services
• Bereavement counseling for the family up to one year after the patient’s death
Although hospice care has become more widespread, these new programs are subjected to more
rigorous insurance guidelines that dictate the types and amounts of medications used, length of
stay, and types of patients who are eligible to receive hospice care (Weitz, 2007). Thus, more
patients are being served, but providers have less control over the services they provide, and
lengths of stay are more limited. In addition, a recent report by the Office of the Inspector
General at U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (2018) highlighted some of the
vulnerabilities of the hospice system in the U.S. Among the concerns raised were that hospices
did not always provide the care that was needed and sometimes the quality of that care was poor,
even at Medicare certified facilities.
Not all racial and ethnic groups feel the same way about hospice care. African-American
families may believe that medical treatment should be pursued on behalf of an ill relative as long
450

as possible and that only God can decide when a person dies. Chinese-American families may
feel very uncomfortable discussing issues of death or being near the deceased family member's
body. The view that hospice care should always be used is not held by everyone, and health care
providers need to be sensitive to the wishes and beliefs of those they serve (Coolen, 2012).

Family Caregivers
Figure 10.15

According to the Institute of Medicine (2015), it is estimated that
66 million Americans, or 29% of the adult population, are
caregivers for someone who is dying or chronically ill. Two-thirds
of these caregivers are women. This care takes its toll physically,
emotionally, and financially. Family caregivers may face the
physical challenges of lifting, dressing, feeding, bathing, and
transporting a dying or ill family member. They may worry about
whether they are performing all tasks safely and properly, as they
receive little training or guidance. Such caregiving tasks may also
interfere with their ability to take care of themselves and meet
other family and workplace obligations. Financially, families may
face high out of pocket expenses (IOM, 2015).

As can be seen in Table 10.1, most family caregivers are providing
care by themselves with little professional intervention, are
employed, and have provided care for more than 3 years. The
annual loss of productivity in the U.S. was $25 billion in 2013 as a result of work absenteeism
due to providing this care. As the prevalence of chronic disease rises, the need for family
caregivers is growing. Unfortunately, the number of potential family caregivers is declining as
the large baby boomer generation enters into late adulthood (Redfoot, Feinberg, & Houser,
2013).

Advanced Directives
Advanced care planning refers to all documents
that pertain to end-of-life care. These include
advance directives and medical orders. Advance
directives include documents that mention a health
care agent and living wills. These are initiated by
the patient. Living wills are written or video
statements that outline the health care initiates the
person wishes under certain circumstances.
Durable power of attorney for health care names
the person who should make health care decisions
in the event that the patient is incapacitated. In
contrast, medical orders are crafted by a medical
professional on behalf of a seriously ill patient.
Unlike advanced directives, as these are doctor’s
Source
orders, they must be followed by other medical
personnel. Medical orders include Physician
Orders for Life-sustaining Treatment (POLST), do-not-resuscitate, do-not-incubate, or do-nothospitalize. In some instances, medical orders may be limited to the facility in which they were
written. Several states have endorsed POLST so that they are applicable across heath care
settings (IOM, 2015).
Figure 10.16 Living Wills help
identify treatments acceptable to the
patient or those refused.

Despite the fact that many Americans worry about the financial burden of end-of-life care, “more
than one-quarter of all adults, including those aged 75 and older, have given little or no thought
to their end-of-life wishes, and even fewer have captured those wishes in writing or through
conversation” (IOM, 2015, p. 18).

Cultural Differences in End-of-Life Decisions
Cultural factors strongly influence how doctors, other health care providers, and family members
communicate bad news to patients, the expectations regarding who makes the health care
decisions, and attitudes about end-of-life care (Ganz, 2019; Searight & Gafford, 2005a). In
Western medicine, doctors take the approach that patients should be told the truth about their
health. Blank (2011) reports that 75% of the world’s population do not conduct medicine by the
same standards. Thus, outside Western nations, and even among certain racial and ethnic groups
within the those nations, doctors and family members may conceal the full nature of a terminal
illness, as revealing such information is viewed as potentially harmful to the patient, or at the
very least is seen as disrespectful and impolite. Chattopadhyay and Simon (2008) reported that
in India doctors routinely abide by the family’s wishes and withhold information from the
patient, while in Germany doctors are legally required to inform the patient. In addition, many
doctors in Japan and in numerous African nations used terms such as “mass,” “growth,” and
“unclean tissue” rather than referring to cancer when discussing the illness to patients and their
families (Holland, Geary, Marchini, &Tross, 1987). Family members also actively protect
terminally ill patients from knowing about their illness in many Hispanic, Chinese, and Pakistani
cultures (Kaufert & Putsch, 1997; Herndon & Joyce, 2004).
452

In western medicine, we view the patient as
Figure 10.17
autonomous in health care decisions
(Chattopadhyay & Simon, 2008; Searight &
Gafford, 2005a). However, in other nations the
family or community plays the main role, or
decisions are made primarily by medical
professionals, or the doctors in concert with the
family make the decisions for the patient. For
instance, in comparison to European Americans
and African Americans, Koreans and MexicanAmericans are more likely to view family
Source
members as the decision makers rather than just
the patient (Berger, 1998; Searight & Gafford,
2005a). In many Asian cultures, illness is viewed as a “family event”, not just something that
impacts the individual patient (Blank, 2011; Candib, 2002; Chattopadhyay & Simon, 2008).
Thus, there is an expectation that the family has a say in the health care decisions. As many
cultures attribute high regard and respect for doctors, patients and families may defer some of the
end-of-life decision making to the medical professionals (Searight & Gafford, 2005b).
The notion of advanced directives hold little or no relevance in many cultures outside of western
society (Blank, 2011). For instance, in India advanced directives are virtually non-existent,
while in Germany they are regarded as a major part of health care (Chattopadhyay & Simon,
2008). Moreover, end-of-life decisions involve how much medical aid should be used. In the
United States, Canada, and most European countries artificial feeding is more commonly used
once a patient has stopped eating, while in many other nations lack of eating is seen as a sign,
rather than a cause, of dying and do not consider using a feeding tube (Blank, 2011).
According to a Pew Research Center Survey (Lipka,
2014), while death may not be a comfortable topic to
ponder, 37% of their survey respondents had given a
great deal of thought about their end-of-life wishes,
with 35% having put these in writing. Yet, over 25%
had given no thought to this issue. Lipka (2014) also
found that there were clear racial and ethnic
differences in end-of-life wishes (see Figure 10.18).
Whites are more likely than Blacks and Hispanics to
prefer to have treatment stopped if they have a
terminal illness. While the majority of Blacks (61%)
and Hispanics (55%) prefer that everything be done
to keep them alive. Searight and Gafford (2005a)
suggest that the low rate of completion of advanced
directives among non-whites may reflect a distrust of
the U.S. health care system as a result of the health
care disparities non-whites have experienced. Among
Hispanics, patients may also be reluctant to select a
single family member to be responsible for end-oflife decisions out of a concern of isolating the person
453

named and of offending other family members, as this is commonly seen as a “family
responsibility” (Morrison, Zayas, Mulvihill, Baskin, & Meier, 1998).

Euthanasia
Euthanasia is defined as intentionally ending one’s life when suffering from a terminal illness or
severe disability (Youdin, 2016). Euthanasia is further separated into active euthanasia, which
is intentionally causing death, usually through a lethal dose of medication, and passive
euthanasia occurs when life-sustaining support is withdrawn. This can occur through the
removal of a respirator, feeding tube, or heart-lung machine.
Physician-assisted dying is a form of
active euthanasia whereby a physician
prescribes the means by which a person
can die. The United States federal
government does not legislate physicianassisted dying as laws are handled at the
state level (ProCon.org, 2018). Nine states
and the District of Columbia (D.C.)
currently allow physician-assisted dying.
The person seeking physician-assisted
dying must be: (1) at least 18 years of age,
(2) have six or less months until expected
death, and (3) obtain two oral (or least 15
days apart) and one written request from a
physician (ProCon.org, 2016). Table 10.2
lists the 9 states and D.C. that allow
physician-assisted dying and the date the
act was passed.

Since 1997 in Oregon, 2,216 people had lethal prescriptions written and 1459 patients (65.8%)
died from the medication as of January 2019 (Death with Dignity, 2019) (see Figure 10.19).

Canada and several European countries, including Switzerland, Belgium, Luxembourg, and the
Netherlands also allow physician-assisted dying. As of 2014, Belgium is the only country that
allows the right to die to those under the age of 18. Stricter conditions were put in place for
children, including parental consent, the child must be suffering from a serious and incurable
disease, the child must understand what euthanasia means, and the child’s death must be
expected in the near future (Narayan, 2016).
Figure 10.20 Hippocratic
Oath and Euthanasia

The practice of physician-assisted dying is certainly
controversial with religious, legal, ethical, and medical experts
weighing in with opinions. The main areas where there is
disagreement between those who support physician-assisted
dying and those who do not include: (1) whether a person has
the legal right to die, (2) whether active euthanasia would
become a “slippery slope” and start a trend to legalize deaths for
individuals who may be disabled or unable to give consent, (3)
how to interpret the Hippocratic Oath and what it exactly means
for physicians to do no harm, (4) whether the government
should be involved in end-of-life decisions, and (5) specific
religious restrictions against deliberately ending a life
(ProCon.org, 2016). Not surprisingly, there are strong opinions
on both sides of this topic. According to a 2013 Pew Research
Center survey, 47% of Americans approve and 49% disapprove
of laws that would allow a physician to prescribe lethal doses of
drugs that a terminally ill patient could use to commit suicide
(Pew Research Center, 2013). Attitudes on physician-assisted
dying were roughly the same in 2005, when 46% approved and
45% disapproved.

Religious Practices after Death
Funeral rites are expressions of loss that reflect personal and cultural beliefs about the meaning
of death and the afterlife. Ceremonies provide survivors a sense of closure after a loss. These
rites and ceremonies send the message that the death is real and allow friends and loved ones to
express their love and duty to those who die. Under circumstances in which a person has been
lost and presumed dead or when family members were unable to attend a funeral, there can
continue to be a lack of closure that makes it difficult to grieve and to learn to live with loss.
Although many people are still in shock when they attend funerals, the ceremony still provides a
marker of the beginning of a new period of one's life as a survivor. The following are some of
the religious practices regarding death, however, individual religious interpretations and
practices may occur (Dresser & Wasserman, 2010; Schechter, 2009).
Hindu: The Hindu belief in reincarnation accelerates the funeral ritual, and deceased Hindus are
cremated as soon as possible. After being washed, the body is anointed, dressed, and then placed
on a stand decorated with flowers ready for cremation. Once the body has been cremated, the
ashes are collected and, if possible, dispersed in one of India’s holy rivers.
455

Judaism: Among the Orthodox, the deceased is first washed and then wrapped in a simple white
shroud. Males are also wrapped in their prayer shawls. Once shrouded the body is placed into a
plain wooden coffin. The burial must occur as soon as possible after death, and a simple service
consisting of prayers and a eulogy is given. After burial the family members typically gather in
one home, often that of the deceased, and receive visitors. This is referred to as “sitting shiva”.
Muslim: In Islam the deceased are buried as soon as possible, and it is a requirement that the
community be involved in the ritual. The individual is first washed and then wrapped in a plain
white shroud called a kafan. Next, funeral prayers are said followed by the burial. The shrouded
dead are placed directly in the earth without a casket and deep enough not to be disturbed. They
are also positioned in the earth, on their right side, facing Mecca, Saudi Arabia.
Roman Catholic: Before death an ill
Catholic individual is anointed by a priest,
commonly referred to as the Anointing of the
Sick. The priest recites a prayer and applies
consecrated oil to the forehead and hands of
the ill person. The individual also takes a
final communion consisting of consecrated
bread and wine. The funeral rites consist of
three parts. First is the wake that usually
occurs in a funeral parlor. The body is
present, and prayers and eulogies are offered
by family and friends. The funeral mass is
next which includes an opening prayer, bible
readings, liturgy, communion, and a
concluding rite. The funeral then moves to
the cemetery where a blessing of the grave,
scripture reading, and prayers conclude the
funeral ritual.

Green Burial
In 2017, the median cost of an adult funeral with
viewing and burial was $8,775. The median cost for
viewing and cremation was $6,260 (National
Funeral Directors Association (NFDA), 2019). The
same NFDA survey found that nearly half of all
respondents had attended a funeral in a nontraditional setting, such as an outdoor setting that
was meaningful to the deceased, and over half of the
respondents said they would be interested in
exploring green funeral options (NFDA, 2017).
According to the Green Burial Council (GBC)
(2019) Americans bury over 64 thousand tons of
steel, 17 thousand tons of copper and bronze, 1.6
456

Figure 10.22 Green Burial Site UK

million tons of concrete, 20 million feet of wood, and over 4 million gallons of embalming fluid
every year. As a result, there has been a growing interest in green or natural burials. Green
burials attempt to reduce the impact on the environment at every stage of the funeral. This can
include using recycled paper, biodegradable caskets, cotton shroud in the place of any casket,
formaldehyde free, or no embalming, and trying to maintain the natural environment around the
burial site (GBC, 2019). According to the NFDA (2017), many cemeteries have reported that
consumers are requesting green burial options, and since many of the add-ons of a traditional
burial, such as a concrete vault, embalming, and casket are not required, the cost can be
substantially less.

Grief, Bereavement, and Mourning
The terms grief, bereavement, and mourning are often used interchangeably, however, they have
different meanings. Grief is the normal process of reacting to a loss. Grief can be in response to
a physical loss, such as a death, or a social loss including a relationship or job. Bereavement is
the period after a loss during which grief and mourning occurs. The time spent in bereavement
for the loss of a loved one depends on the circumstances of the loss and the level of attachment
to the person who died. Mourning is the process by which people adapt to a loss. Mourning is
greatly influenced by cultural beliefs, practices, and rituals (Casarett, Kutner, & Abrahm,2001).
Grief Reactions: Typical grief reactions involve mental, physical, social and/or emotional
responses. These reactions can include feelings of numbness, anger, guilt, anxiety, sadness and
despair. The individual can experience difficulty concentrating, sleep and eating problems, loss
of interest in pleasurable activities, physical problems, and even illness. Research has
demonstrated that the immune systems of individuals grieving is suppressed and their healthy
cells behave more sluggishly, resulting in greater susceptibility to illnesses (Parkes & Prigerson,
2010). However, the intensity and duration of typical grief symptoms do not match those usually
seen in severe grief reactions, and symptoms typically diminish within 6-10 weeks (Youdin,
2016).
Complicated Grief: After the loss of a loved one,
however, some individuals experience
complicated grief, which includes atypical grief
reactions (Newson, Boelen, Hek, Hofman, &
Tiemeier, 2011). Symptoms of complicated grief
include: Feelings of disbelief, a preoccupation
with the dead loved one, distressful memories,
feeling unable to move on with one’s life, and a
yearning for the deceased. Additionally, these
symptoms may last six months or longer and
mirror those seen in major depressive disorder
(Youdin, 2016).

Figure 10.23

Source

According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.; American
Psychiatric Association, 2013), distinguishing between major depressive disorder and
complicated grief requires clinical judgment. The psychologist needs to evaluate the client’s
457

individual history and determine whether the symptoms are focused entirely on the loss of the
loved one and represent the individual’s cultural norms for grieving, which would be acceptable.
Those who seek assistance for complicated grief usually have experienced traumatic forms of
bereavement, such as unexpected, multiple and violent deaths, or those due to murders or
suicides (Parkes & Prigerson, 2010).
Disenfranchised Grief: Grief that is not socially recognized is referred to as disenfranchised
grief (Doka, 1989). Examples of disenfranchised grief include death due to AIDS, the suicide of
a loved one, perinatal deaths, abortions, the death of a pet, lover, or ex-spouse, and psychological
losses, such as a partner developing Alzheimer’s disease. Due to the type of loss, there is no
formal mourning practices or recognition by others that would comfort the grieving individual.
Consequently, individuals experiencing disenfranchised grief may suffer intensified symptoms
due to the lack of social support (Parkes & Prigerson, 2010).
Anticipatory Grief: Grief that occurs when a death is expected, and survivors have time to
prepare to some extent before the loss is referred to as anticipatory grief. This expectation can
make adjustment after a loss somewhat easier (Kübler-Ross & Kessler, 2005). A death after a
long-term, painful illness may bring family members a sense of relief that the suffering is over,
and the exhausting process of caring for someone who is ill is also completed.

Models of Grief
There are several theoretical models of grief, however, none is all encompassing (Youdin, 2016).
These models are merely guidelines for what an individual may experience while grieving.
However, if individuals do not fit a model, it does not mean there is something “wrong” with the
way they experience grief. It is important to remember that there is no one way to grieve, and
people move through a variety of stages of grief in various ways.
Five Stages of Grief: Kübler-Ross (1969, 1975) describes five stages of loss experienced by
someone who faces the news of their impending death. These "stages" are not really stages that a
person goes through in order or only once; nor are they stages that occur with the same
intensity. Indeed, the process of death is influenced by a person's life experiences, the timing of
their death in relation to life events, the predictability of their death based on health or illness,
their belief system, and their assessment of the quality of their own life. Nevertheless, these
stages help us to understand and recognize some of what a dying person experiences
psychologically, and by understanding, we are more equipped to support that person as they die.
•

Denial is often the first reaction to overwhelming, unimaginable news. Denial, or
disbelief or shock, protects us by allowing such news to enter slowly and to give us time
to come to grips with what is taking place. The person who receives positive test results
for life-threatening conditions may question the results, seek second opinions, or may
simply feel a sense of disbelief psychologically even though they know that the results
are true.

•

Anger also provides us with protection in that being angry energizes us to fight against
something and gives structure to a situation that may be thrusting us into the unknown. It
is much easier to be angry than to be sad, in pain, or depressed. It helps us to temporarily
458

believe that we have a sense of control over our future and to feel that we have at least
expressed our rage about how unfair life can be. Anger can be focused on a person, a
health care provider, at God, or at the world in general. It can be expressed over issues
that have nothing to do with our death; consequently, being in this stage of loss is not
always obvious.
•

Bargaining involves trying to think of what could be done to turn the situation
around. Living better, devoting self to a cause, being a better friend, parent, or spouse, are
all agreements one might willingly commit to if doing so would lengthen life. Asking to
just live long enough to witness a family event or finish a task are examples of
bargaining.

•

Depression or sadness is appropriate for such an event. Feeling the full weight of loss,
crying, and losing interest in the outside world is an important part of the process of
dying. This depression makes others feel very uncomfortable and family members may
try to console their loved one. Sometimes hospice care may include the use of
antidepressants to reduce depression during this stage.

•

Acceptance involves learning how to carry on and to incorporate this aspect of the life
span into daily existence. Reaching acceptance does not in any way imply that people
who are dying are happy about it or content with it. It means that they are facing it and
continuing to make arrangements and to say what they wish to say to others. Some
terminally ill people find that they live life more fully than ever before after they come to
this stage.

According to Kübler-Ross (1969), behind these five stages focused on the identified emotions,
there is a sense of hope. Kübler-Ross noted that in all the 200 plus patients she and her students
interviewed, a little bit of hope that they might not die was always in the back of their minds.
Criticisms of Kübler-Ross’s Five Stages of Grief: Some researchers have been skeptical of the
validity of there being stages to grief among the dying (Friedman & James, 2008). As KüblerRoss notes in her own work, it is difficult to empirically test the experiences of the dying. “How
do you do research on dying,…? When you cannot verify your data and cannot set up
experiments?” (Kübler-Ross, 1969, p. 19). She and four students from the Chicago Theology
Seminary in 1965 decided to listen to the experiences of dying patients, but her ideas about death
and dying are based on the interviewers’ collective “feelings” about what the dying were
experiencing and needed (Kübler-Ross, 1969). While she goes on to say in support of her
approach that she and her students read nothing about the prior literature on death and dying, so
as to have no preconceived ideas, a later work revealed that her own experiences of grief from
childhood undoubtedly colored her perceptions of the grieving process (Kübler-Ross & Kessler,
2005). Kübler-Ross is adamant in her theory that the one stage that all those who are dying go
through is anger. It is clear from her 2005 book that anger played a central role in “her” grief
and did so for many years (Friedman & James, 2008).
There have been challenges to the notion that denial and acceptance are beneficial to the grieving
process (Telford, Kralik, & Koch, 2006). Denial can become a barrier between the patient and
health care specialists and reduce the ability to educate and treat the patient. Similarly,
459

acceptance of a terminal diagnosis may also lead patients to give up and forgo treatments to
alleviate their symptoms. In fact, some research suggests that optimism about one’s prognosis
may help in one’s adjustment and increase longevity (Taylor, Kemeny, Reed, Bower &
Gruenewald, 2000).
A third criticism is not so much of Kübler-Ross’s work, but how others have assumed that these
stages apply to anyone who is grieving. Her research focused only on those who were terminally
ill. This does not mean that others who are grieving the loss of someone would necessarily
experience grief in the same way. Friedman and James (2008) and Telford et al. (2006)
expressed concern that mental health professionals, along with the general public, may assume
that grief follows a set pattern, which may create more harm than good.
Lastly, the Yale Bereavement Study, completed between January 2000 and January 2003, did not
find support for Kübler-Ross’s five stage theory of grief (Maciejewski, Zhang, Block, &
Prigerson, 2007). Results indicated that acceptance was the most commonly reported reaction
from the start, and yearning was the most common negative feature for the first two years. The
other variables, such as disbelief, depression, and anger, were typically absent or minimal.
Although there is criticism of the Five Stages of Grief Model, Kübler-Ross made people more
aware of the needs and concerns of the dying, especially those who were terminally ill. As she
notes,
…when a patient is severely ill, he is often treated like a person with no right to an
opinion. It is often someone else who makes the decision if and when and where a
patient should be hospitalized. It would take so little to remember that the sick person
has feelings, has wishes and opinions, and has – most important of all – the right to be
heard. (1969, p. 7-8).
Dual-Process Model of Grieving: The dual-process model takes into consideration that
bereaved individuals move back and forth between grieving and preparing for life without their
loved one (Stroebe & Schut, 2001; Stroebe, Schut, & Stroebe, 2005). This model focuses on a
loss orientation, which emphasizes the feelings of loss and yearning for the deceased and a
restoration orientation, which centers on the grieving individual reestablishing roles and
activities they had prior to the death of their loved one. When oriented toward loss grieving
individuals look back, and when oriented toward restoration they look forward. As one cannot
look both back and forward at the same time, a bereaved person must shift back and forth
between the two. Both orientations facilitate normal grieving and interact until bereavement has
completed.

Grief: Loss of Children and Parents
Loss of a Child: According to Parkes and Prigerson (2010), the loss of a child at any age is
considered “the most distressing and long-lasting of all griefs” (p. 142). Bereaved parents suffer
an increased risk to both physical and mental health and exhibit an increased mortality rate.
Additionally, they earn higher scores on inventories of grief compared to other types of
bereavement. Of those recently diagnosed with depression, a high percentage had experienced
the death of child within the preceding six months, and 8 percent of women whose child had died
460

attempted or committed suicide. Archer (1999) found that the intensity of grief increased with
the child’s age until the age of 17, when it declined. Archer explained that women have a greater
chance of having another child when younger, and thus with added age comes greater grief as
fertility declines. Certainly, the older the child the more the mother has bonded with the child
and will experience greater grief.
Even when children are adults, parents may experience intense grief, especially when the death is
sudden. Adult children dying in traffic accidents was associated with parents experiencing more
intense grief and depression, greater symptoms on a health check list, and more guilt than those
parents whose adult children died from cancer (Parkes & Prigerson, 2010). Additionally, the
deaths of unmarried adult children still residing at home and those who experienced alcohol and
relationship problems were especially difficult for parents. Overall, in societies in which
childhood deaths are statistically infrequent, parents are often unprepared for the loss of their
daughter or son and suffer high levels of grief.
Loss of Parents in Adulthood: In contrast to the loss of a child,
the loss of parents in adult life is much more common and results
in less suffering. In their literature review, Moss and Moss
(1995) found that the loss of a parent in adult life is “rarely
pathological.” Those adult children who appear to have the most
difficulty dealing with the loss of a parent are adult men who
remain unmarried and continue to live with their mothers. In
contrast, those who are in satisfying marriages are less likely to
require grief assistance (Parkes & Prigerson, 2010). To
determine the effects of gender on parental death, Marks, Jun
and Song (2007) analyzed longitudinal data from the National
Survey of Families and Households that assessed multiple
Source
dimensions of psychological well-being in adulthood including
depression, happiness, self-esteem, mastery, psychological
wellness, alcohol abuse, and physical health. Findings indicated that a father’s death led to more
negative effects for sons than daughters, and a mother’s death lead to more negative effects for
daughters.

Loss of Parents in Childhood: Parental deaths in
childhood have been associated with adjustment
problems that may last into adulthood. Ellis, Dowrick
and Lloyd-Williams (2013) identified several negative
outcomes associated with childhood grief including
increased chance of substance abuse, greater
susceptibility to depression, higher chance of criminal
behavior, school underachievement, and lower
employment rates. Typically, professional help is not
required in helping children and teens who are dealing
with the death of a loved one.

However, Worden (2002) identified ten “red flags” displayed by grieving children that may
indicate the need for professional assistance:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Persistent difficulty in talking about the dead person
Persistent or destructive aggressive behavior
Persisting anxiety, clinging, or fears
Somatic complaints (stomachaches, headaches)
Sleeping difficulties
Eating disturbance
Marked social withdrawal
School difficulties or serious academic reversal
Persistent self-blame or guilt
Self-destructive behavior

As parents may also be dealing with funeral arrangements and other end of life matters, they may
not always have the time to address questions and concerns that children may have. When
explaining death to children it is important to use real words, such as died and death (Dresser &
Wasserman, 2010). Children do not understand the meanings of such phrases as “passed away”,
“left us”, or “lost”, and they can become confused as to what happened. Saying a loved one died
of a disease called cancer, is preferable to saying he was “very sick”. The child may become
worried when others become sick that they too will die. Consequently, it is important that
children have someone who will listen to, and accurately address their concerns.

Mourning
As a society, are we given the tools and time to adequately mourn? Not all researchers agree that
we do. The "death-denying, grief-dismissing world" is the modern world (Kübler-Ross &
Kessler, 2005, p. 205). We often grieve privately, quickly, and medicate our suffering with
substances or activities. Employers grant 3 to 5 days for bereavement, if the loss is that of an
immediate family member, and such leaves are sometimes limited to no more than one per
year. Yet grief takes much longer and the bereaved are seldom ready to perform well on the job
after just a few days. Obviously, life does have to continue, but we need to acknowledge and
make more caring accommodations for those who are in grief.
Four Tasks of Mourning: Worden (2008) identified four tasks that facilitate the mourning
process. Worden believes that all four tasks must be completed, but they may be completed in
any order and for varying amounts of time. These tasks include:
• Acceptance that the loss has occurred
• Working through the pain of grief
• Adjusting to life without the deceased
• Starting a new life while still maintaining a connection with the deceased

462

Support Groups: Support groups are helpful for
grieving individuals of all ages, including those
who are sick, terminal, caregiving, or mourning
the loss of a loved one. Support groups reduce
isolation, connect individuals with others who
have similar experiences, and offer those
grieving a place to share their pain and learn new
ways of coping (Lynn & Harrold, 2011). Support
groups are available through religious
organizations, hospitals, hospice, nursing homes,
mental health facilities, and schools for children.

Viewing death as an integral part of the lifespan
will benefit those who are ill, those who are bereaved, and all of us as friends, caregivers,
partners, family members and humans in a global society.
