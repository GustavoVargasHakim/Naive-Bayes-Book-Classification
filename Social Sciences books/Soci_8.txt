San Francisco, Portland, Austin, Madison, and Minneapolis are considered some
of the country’s best-designed and most politically liberal cities. Mention of each
brings to mind public parks, ample bike lanes, eclectic music scenes, colleges,
creatives, and craft beer. Each has focused public funds on livability investments
like transit, public spaces, arts, and entertainment. Each has said that equity—fair
and just access to opportunities and resources for all of its citizens—is a central
concern of its place and policy-making. But as David Dahmer asks in his article
titled “The Harsh Truth about Progressive Cities,” (Dahmer, 2015) why are these
cities some of the most unjust in the U.S.?
My own hometowns of Minneapolis and St. Paul have, in the last ten years, topped
the charts for livable neighborhoods and beautiful parks. A 2015 article in The
Introduction to Design Equity | 1

Atlantic, titled “The Miracle of Minneapolis,” said that “No other place mixes
affordability, opportunity, and wealth so well” (Thompson, 2015). But what the
article did not point out—though many readers immediately did—is that, livability
awards aside, and official rhetoric about the importance of equity aside, the Twin
Cities is still one of the worst places in the country to be Black or Native American.
That’s right, one of the worst. And this is on important measures like education,
health, and jobs.
This comes as a big surprise to many white Minnesotans. We are used to looking
at statistics in aggregate, not separated by race or ethnicity. In aggregate, we look
pretty good. So we pat ourselves on the back and assume that those aggregated
statistics hold for all Minnesotans. We assume we are good people with good
leaders. We assume “those problems” don’t plague Northern cities. Cities where
NPR is well funded and politicians, at least until you hit the suburbs, are mainly left

Why doesn’t “good” design and planning mean better lives for everyone? We know
the built environment has a huge impact on health, mobility, jobs, safety, and social
networks—but why are these impacts so unevenly felt across a city?
These questions aren’t new, not even in the design fields. They are, however,
receiving renewed attention in several public interest design programs across the
country where students, faculty, and practitioners are teaming up to address the
gap between our professional pledge to serve “the public good” and the reality
that the public we have been serving best is mainly white and often affluent. These
programs are partnering with non-profits and municipalities to build community
gardens, rethink transit systems, and advocate for better and more affordable
housing. Not all of these programs are new. Many, in fact, can trace their roots
back to the 1970s, as designers tried to chart their paths within larger social justice
movements.

What should we advocate

Although it’s exciting to me that the
pendulum towards socially responsible
design education and practice has

Instead of having transit that connects people to jobs and home, parks and public
spaces that are well maintained and active, and housing that is affordable and safe
and beautiful, we will be left to explain why nothing tangible came of the design
process. How do we make sure this doesn’t happen? What should we advocate for?
What skills do designers need to have? What do they need to know?
This book, originally created for a Public Interest Design (PID) course at the
University of Minnesota called Design Equity, was written with the hope that it
will become a resource for professional designers, non-profit and government
partners, and community members. In conversations about how we want to
ground the entire PID program, the word equity became a way to wrestle with
what we mean by public interest. Equity means fair and just access to
opportunities and resources and, in our minds, should be a fundamental goal of all
public interest design projects and programs.
In the past few years, unfortunately, the term equity has become ubiquitous and
its definition murky. It seems like every government report or new foundation
initiative has incorporated the word into its title. In “Is Equity the New Coconut
Water?,” Vu Le comments on the term’s overuse in Seattle: You can’t walk down
the street without hearing someone saying something like, “Equity. Equity, equity,
equity. Blah blah community engagement Seahawks equity” (Vu, 2014).
If the term has lost its intended meaning, should we, as Vu Le asks, put it back on
the grocery store shelf next to the kombucha? Does it still have value to designers
working for social justice? I think we need to keep it (or take it back, depending
on your view). It’s prevalence presents ample opportunities to spark conversations
about its real meaning. Each time the word is spoken—in a public meeting or
behind closed doors, in a foundation report or a design proposal—there is an
opening, a moment when an important and difficult conversation about systemic
racial disparities could occur.
There is value in the specific and
surprising turn of phrase required in
defining equity. We see the word equity

because the playing field is not level. We
don’t start from a point of equality.
Throughout our history and up to today, unfair policies have privileged certain
groups of people over others. Privilege exists when one group has something of
value that others do not because of the groups they belong to, not because of what
they have done or failed to do.
This disjuncture between equity as equal and equity as fair can fuel the
conversations needed to make San Francisco, Portland, Austin, Madison, and
Minneapolis/St. Paul into places where everyone has the chance to
flourish—conversations that acknowledge and examine the history of this privilege
and its specific impact on people in each city.
Equity is an ethical principle, a position on what is good and right. It can be defined
as “fair and just access for all,” and refers to the fair distribution of impacts—both
benefits and costs. To quote Braveman and Gruskin, two health equity researchers:
…equity…is the absence of systematic disparities…between groups with
different levels of underlying social advantage/disadvantage—that is, wealth,
power, or prestige. Inequities…put groups of people who are already socially
disadvantaged (for example, by virtue of being poor, female, and/or
members of a disenfranchised racial, ethnic, or religious group) at further
disadvantage…. (Braveman & Gruskin, 2003, p. 254)
Equity does not mean numerically equal. It does not mean, for example, that the
same amount of transit should be available to all people. Why? For low income
families, who spend 45% of their income on transportation, a change in routes
or schedules can mean less time at home, and missing the bus because of
inconsistent scheduling can mean losing a job. For these families, the costs and
risks are higher than they are for me. I have direct access to two cars, know lots of
people with access to cars who could help in a pinch, and won’t get fired if I’m late
for work.
Another reason to take hold of the word equity is that if we don’t clearly define
and deploy the word, it will be usurped by those with the most power—usually
those with the least interest in making better outcomes for people who historically
and presently have the most at stake. It’s not just professionals or government
officials who say “equity” but mean equal; it’s also community members involved
in public participation processes. Depending on your implicit definition of equity,

don’t see who had a say in the decisions,
where the money came from, and which people the project does or doesn’t
benefit. We can, however, train ourselves to see these “hidden” outcomes in the
present by looking at examples from the past. Environmental design history can
also show us how we got into this inequitable state.
In the next chapter we will examine decades of design decisions that helped create
today’s uneven playing field. The history of environmental design shows us how
the physical qualities we see in our cities, combined with what we don’t see—the
laws, policies, and processes—have allowed disparities to grow.
Why do these disparities persist? Why is
it so hard to achieve equity? I think one

downplay issues of gender, disability, or

that have led to such shameful statistics in my own and many other U.S.
communities. In Chapter 3 we will look at how personal and institutional racism
work, why these discussions are so difficult, and how we can learn to get over our
fears and engage in effective conversations.
Next we will dig into some of the equity fields that are most related to

2. For instance, researchers studying post-Katrina planning efforts found that some residents
advocated for equity as a way of acknowledging and addressing ongoing patterns of
discrimination which “left different groups of people with much less.” Others advocated for
equity as equal and supported projects and policies that did nothing to address
fundamental historic disparities. (Brand 2015), 249. http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/

environmental design, like health, information, and transportation. How is equity
understood in these fields? How does each field relate to environmental design
products and processes? What solutions have been developed in these fields to
bring us to equity? Is there a role for designers in their work?
Finally, we will bring our conversation back to design practice. How, given all that
we have learned about equity, can environmental design help create equitable
cities? Where are leverage points for generating more equitable outcomes? What
is possible? What are the pitfalls? How does equity-driven design work differ from
traditional design practice? How do we pay for it? How do we evaluate it? And most
importantly, how do we sustain it over the long haul? Our cities didn’t become
inequitable overnight. Remaking them as places of opportunity for everyone is
going to be a long haul.

Chapter 2: Learning to Talk about
Racism

Design Equity Class with community leader and educator Melvin Giles at the Aurora St. Anthony
Peace Garden in St. Paul. 2015

During the second week of the Design Equity class we begin to learn how to talk
about racism. I remember the night before the “racism talk” the first time I taught
this class, four years ago; I was a nervous wreck. The session came early in the
semester, before I knew all of the students, before they really knew me or each
other. How would the session go? I was lucky to have two friend-colleagues, Melvin
Giles and Megan Phinney, two of the co-founders of the Urban Farm and Garden

Alliance in St. Paul, MN, leading our conversation; I knew they would be respectful
and supportive of the students. In addition to being two of the kindest people I
know, they are experts in leading these conversations. So why couldn’t I fall asleep?
Where was all of this fear coming from?
Melvin and Megan anticipate that most people feel fearful when faced with a
conversation about racism in a group of people they don’t know very well. So after
introducing themselves, they begin by passing around small slips of paper and
asking everyone to write down something they find scary or difficult in talking
about racism. They then gather and redistribute the slips so that each person reads
aloud someone else’s fear. We learn that for some, fear of talking about racism
is fear of being judged, of saying the wrong thing, of being labeled a racist. For
others, it is fear of being pitied or misunderstood or viewed as angry. For some, it
is all of the above. Some students share memories of painful conversations about
racism with friends or family members that went really wrong really fast. And some
sincerely believe that they “don’t see race,” so why bother?
The fact that there are so many different reasons why talking about racism stresses
us out tells us two very important things about how racism persists and why
conversations about race can fall apart. First, we have all had very different
experiences in our lives, and if we haven’t experienced something like racism it’s
hard to understand how pervasive it is. Our individual ways of seeing the world
are so much a part of who we are that they remain mostly unconscious, but they
underlie our responses to everyone and every idea we encounter.
Second, the fear of being labeled as a bad person and the defensiveness that can
result from this fear can keep us from having meaningful discussions. Language
around racism is confusing, so it’s no wonder this fear is so strong. Jay Smooth says:
…anytime we’re dealing with race issues, we are dealing with a social
construct that was not born out of any science or reason or logic, we are
grappling with a social construct that was not designed to make sense….It’s
a dance partner that’s designed to trip us up. (Smooth, 2011)
There are a lot of words and ideas and concepts tied to the social construct of race,
and some seem to conflict with one another. For example, how does racism exist
when race does not? We use the term racism to talk about how people are judged
on the basis of their appearance and culture, while at the same time we know that
skin color and culture do not define separate human races. We know it now, but
for a long time people in power promoted the idea that there were separate races,
using it as justification for certain groups to be treated unfairly.

video does a great job of suggesting
ways to handle the fact that, when it
comes to conversations about race, we are going to make mistakes. I think about
his “dental analogy,” (where he wonders why people can’t accept being told that
something they said sounded racist, with the same openness that people accept
being told that they have food in their teeth) a lot when I feel apprehensive upon
discovering yet another pocket of racism in my own thinking or actions. Instead of
letting defensiveness take over, I try to see my mistakes as opportunities to expand
my understanding of the world beyond my personal experiences.
An interview with Beverly Daniel Tatum, clinical psychologist, professor, and
President of Spelman College, digs further into how racism persists and is
2
experienced by people day-to-day. Tatum points out many common situations
that can impact people in very different ways, depending on their skin color, and
that can strengthen particular views of how the world works. As much as I think
about racism, her interview showed me many situations I had never thought
about, because I’d never needed to; it is truly eye-opening.
Physician and epidemiologist Dr. Camara Jones further explains the persistence
3
of racism by showing how it operates at different levels. In her video, Dr. Jones
uses a gardening allegory to describe personally mediated, internalized, and
institutionalized racism, and how these different types work together. Her
clarification of abstract terms using vivid imagery can help us grapple with a
tangled social construct.
With the help of Melvin and Megan and of resources like these, what used to be
the most stressful class session has become one of my favorites, one in which I feel
that we start to gel as a group of people trying to figure things out together. It
makes me feel like a student, because there is a lot about my own world view and
my own assumptions and biases that I haven’t yet uncovered or questioned. And
it makes me feel that I’m starting to become the teacher I want to be—one who
helps students have valuable conversations.

I no longer worry about this class session like I did three years ago. Melvin and
Megan continue to create generous and thoughtful environments in which
participants can really talk to each other, and students continue to prove that
they are ready to have these difficult conversations. Even though they don’t yet
know each other well, they come in ready to hear people out and talk through the
readings. Instead of seeing this class session as the “racism” session, I now see it
as a starting point for the whole semester—a starting point grounded in a sincere
desire for us to figure out where we are and where we want to go.

Design Equity

The history of how cities in the United States were designed, built, and rebuilt helps
answer two important questions: Why doesn’t equity mean everyone getting the
same thing? And why doesn’t equity mean equal? We will learn that the way cities
were designed and planned meant, for so long, that many people got much less, or
nothing, or had things taken from them. In some cases the taking was completely
legal and based on unfair laws and regulations; in others, the taking was illegal.
The term equity matters, and matters in terms of how we design and build our
cities. For too long these processes and places have allowed some groups to access
opportunities while others are left behind.

together. California Judge LaDoris
Cordell presents one of the most
1
succinct accounts of this history. As you listen to her lecture, take special note of
the stories she tells that relate to the built environment—to housing and housing
financing, to planning and transportation.
When I teach the Design Equity class, we watch a video that dives deeper into the
2
planning of housing in cities and suburbs and the racial wealth gap that resulted.
Then we compile the dates from the readings and video into a large timeline so we
can take it in at once. It’s an awful moment, seeing it up on the wall. Awful if you are
someone whose family experienced it, awful if you are experiencing more of the
same today. And awful if you thought we were living in a post-racial world and had
moved on since slavery and the civil rights movement.
But it can also be a moment when big chunks of our own personal racism—our
unconscious belief that maybe some people are better than others just because of
the color of their skin—can drop away. Those Black neighborhoods you sometimes
drive by aren’t falling apart because people don’t care, they’re falling apart because
for years banks wouldn’t give people loans to fix up their properties. Meanwhile, the
houses in suburban white neighborhoods seem to have stood the test of time—but
that’s because the same banks gave cheap loans to white families.
Do environmental designers know this

know this history?
Most planning programs are tied to a
social sciences program, and planning
history is more likely than design history to be taught from a social/political
perspective. Most designers, in contrast, learn history from an art-history approach,
one aimed at giving us a vocabulary of Western European styles and forms like
Classical, Baroque, Beaux Arts, Modern, and Post-modern, and with a focus more
on how things look than on how they impact people’s lives. This is slowly changing,
but not fast enough.

The resources listed below will help us see the city and all its parts in a different
way—as the physical embodiment of values that continue to shape how people live
and what they can and cannot do. As visual cues to what is considered important
and what is not, who is considered important and who is not, where power is and
where it isn’t.
In the following chapters we will look at how people are trying to address these
injustices from within different fields, like health, transportation, information, and
housing. Each of these fields of equity research and practice takes on overlapping
pieces of a complex puzzle. We will focus here on health, transportation, and
information, mapping some of the ways in which each of these fields relates to
what we have learned so far about equity and the built environment.

Minneapolis and St. Paul, MN Infographic by RWJF on RWJF.org
We will begin our exploration of the different equity fields with health equity.
Health and health equity, as you will learn, encompass issues well beyond whether
someone has fair access to medical care. We will learn that where you live has a
major impact on how healthy you are and can be.
What is health? When we think of a healthy person we tend to focus on whether or

not they are ill, what they eat, and their physical fitness. But human health refers to
a much broader set of issues. Health can be described as:
…more than just the presence or absence of disease. It includes the overall
well-being of an individual, the ability of an individual to fully participate in
the social interactions of a community, and a lack of barriers to good health
across a life span. (Lopez, 2012, p. 12)
Based on this description, what factors would you need to consider to call someone
healthy? What does “overall well-being” mean to you? What allows someone to
fully participate in the “social interactions of a community”?
As I write this I’m thinking about my 83-year-old mom as an example of a healthy
person. If you met her you might be surprised (and I’m sure she would be very
surprised that I chose her). She’s never been what you would call athletic and
has some arthritis in her back, but she’s also almost impossibly positive about
the world. She engages strangers in conversation wherever she goes. She wants
to live as long as she can to see how the lives of each of her six children and 13
grandchildren and two great-grandchildren play out. She tries to eat well, goes to
“gentle yoga” twice a week, and gets together with old friends. She goes to see
her doctor regularly. She still drives to where she needs to go; she lives out in the
suburbs so nothing is within easy walking distance. She’s lived in the same town
for more than 45 years and knows lots of people close by. The ones she doesn’t
know probably had my dad as a middle school teacher. So even beyond her friends

Korean War my parents were able to use the GI Bill for my dad to attend college.
My mom’s tuition was affordable (back when public universities were affordable),
and they used an FHA loan to buy their first house together. Their incomes were
thus higher than those of their parents, and as a result they had better access to
healthcare and other things you need to stay healthy—including a safe home and
neighborhood.
As we have learned from our readings on racial equity and post-WWII housing
policy, people like my parents were lucky to be able to take advantage of federally
subsidized low-interest loans and were not prevented from buying houses in
suburban neighborhoods where homes steadily increased in value. Black families
of the same generation, however, faced institutional and personal racism that
prevented them from doing the same.
Our home was our financial safety net. If push came to shove, my parents could
borrow against its steadily increasing value. I know there were times when they
buckled down on household expenses, especially when my mom went to graduate
school, but I don’t remember the lights going out or not having food in the fridge.
I know my dad would have liked to change jobs after too many years as a middle
school shop teacher, but he was better off than his friends who lost their jobs as
factories closed down in the 1970s and 1980s and unemployment skyrocketed in
our region. His job security was another federal benefit from the GI Bill.

high blood pressure, and other chronic illnesses. As stress goes up, immunities go

start at a disadvantage even before they are born.
This is the health-equity double whammy: if you have the resources to stay
healthy—physically and psychologically—you are better able to advocate for
yourself and make sure that you can stay healthy. If your landlord refuses to get
rid of the asthma-triggering roaches, you can move. If you don’t connect well with
your healthcare provider, you can get a second opinion or call a relative or friend
who is in healthcare for some advice. But if you don’t have these resources, you will
probably become less healthy over time. Your declining health will lead to declining
opportunities to earn money. You may end up with even fewer resources, and in an
even worse situation.

The Social Determinants of Health
As you will read in the Additional Resources section below, the social determinants
of health include the conditions in which we live our lives, both physical and social:
our economic stability, education, health and healthcare, neighborhood and built

environment, and social and community contexts. Only about 25% of our health is
determined by genes, biology, and health behaviors. The other 75% relates to social
determinants. Of those determinants, more than 40% of our health is determined
by our physical environment. Some of the ways in which where we live impacts
our health are highly visible: smog-covered cities, unsafe traffic crossings, a lack of
parks for recreation and exercise, a lack of nearby health clinics or grocery stores,
insect-infested apartments. Others are not as visible, like a lack of living-wage jobs,
educational opportunities, social networks, and political power.
In other words, the place where you live is an indicator of your income level and
social status, which are both key social determinants of health. And the place
where you live—whether it has access to transit, parks, good schools, safe
pedestrian environments, grocery stores, etc.—impacts your ability to be and stay
healthy. The house where my mom grew up in Buffalo, NY became a vacant lot
which sold in 2003 for $1.00.

Environmental Design as a Prescription for Health
Over the past 20 years, environmental designers and health researchers have
argued that a way of bridging the health gap, especially for chronic disease, is to
focus on the built environment. They contend that if we had better sidewalks and
more bike lanes and parks, people would exercise more. If grocery stores selling
healthful foods were in every neighborhood, people would have better nutrition.
But recent evaluations of such measures are leading health researchers to believe
that physical changes to neighborhoods, though important, are not enough. The
same patterns of institutional and personal racism that tie people to low or middleclass housing and neighborhoods also impact their freedom to take advantage
of possibilities that might improve their physical and mental health. Adding
sidewalks, grocery stores, and parks to low-income neighborhoods, for example,
may do little to change people’s health outcomes. These studies argue that we
must also consider the interrelated issues of a person’s life choices (their agency)
and life chances (the underlying social and economic structures within which each
person lives). Going for a walk to get some exercise, buying and preparing healthful
foods, relaxing in the park with family and friends after a stressful work week, are all
life choices that help us stay healthy. But whether or not we can make the “right”
choices depends on the structural issues of how much time, money, and status we
have: our life chances.
Thus structure and agency interact, with agency playing a role in choosing
courses of action among available options that are structured by resources,
norms, and class circumstances (Blacksher Lovasi, 2012, p. 173).
“Structural” issues, like income, can severely limit someone’s ability to buy healthy
foods, feel safe enough in their neighborhood to take a walk, and take time off work
to see friends.
This is not to say that the built environment doesn’t matter to a person’s health.
Rather, environment must be considered alongside agency and structure. Health
can’t be environmentally determined; physical changes alone to a neighborhood
won’t make the neighborhood’s residents healthier. That said, in the case of health
issues related to pollution, physical changes can protect people’s health. People
living in Flint, Michigan would not have lead poisoning if their water supply was
safe. People would be less likely to be hit by cars if intersections prioritized
pedestrian rather than vehicular movement. There are many opportunities to
make broad changes and small improvements that would have a big impact on
these kinds of environmental quality and safety-related issues.

people who do not own their homes
may face rent increases, especially as
property taxes increase for their landlords. They may have to move, which
destabilizes their social networks, brings on more stress, and may require a change
in schools for kids and a longer commute to work. Consider what happens when a
toxic waste site is cleaned up and turned into a park. This often leads to an increase
in rents in the neighborhood, so that the people who had to live so long with these
dangers of toxic waste don’t end up reaping the benefits of the safe, new
amenities. Creating and maintaining safe and affordable housing and preventing
displacement is a key component of any health equity approach.
Since health is such a robust equity measure, touching all aspects of people’s daily
lives and the places where they live, it can seem almost impossible to imagine
the kinds of changes that are needed to create health equity. How can we ensure
that people have the agency to improve their health, and healthy environments in
which to live? Some of the answers to these questions may lie in other equity fields,
like housing, transportation and information equity. Other answers have yet to be
identified or explored.
In “Reducing Health Disparities Through a Focus on Communities” (PolicyLink,
2002), the authors provide an overview of the social determinants of health and
offer example strategies for addressing health disparities. As you read about these
strategies, pay attention to the following questions: who might need to be involved
in implementing them? What range of professional and community expertise is
required? What barriers might arise? What is the relationship between changes
to policies and changes to the built environments? What strategies might relate
to the stories you heard in the “Unnatural Causes” video clips? Were there any
issues raised in the videos that were not discussed in the report? In the next two
chapters, we will read about transportation and information equity. Based on what
you know about health equity, how would fair and just access to transportation and
information help someone lead a healthier life?
By this point I imagine that your
understanding of health has shifted.

Twin Cities residents advocating for equitable transit.
Thai Phan-Quang, photographer.

An equitable transportation system is one that provides affordable
transportation, creates quality jobs, promotes safe and inclusive
communities, and focuses on results that benefit all. It also strengthens
the economy by ensuring that all people—regardless of race, income, or
ability—can connect to the education and work opportunities they need to
participate in and contribute to society and the economy. (PolicyLink, 2016,
p. 2)

do you go to work, the health clinic, the
grocery store, to see your family, and back home again? How far apart are these
resources from one another? Are they well connected by transit or do you need to
drive? Once you park your car or get off your bus are there safe ways to get to your
destination as a pedestrian? How much do you pay for public transportation or
auto-related expenses? Transportation is so important that, after housing, it is the
second highest expenditure for U.S. families.
My first internship after college was at a non-profit environmental organization
about 20 miles from where I lived with my parents. The office was located at the
suburban Amherst Campus of the State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo, a
campus built in the 1960s when lots of institutions were leaving the city along the
routes created by new government funded highway systems. The internship wasn’t
paid, but the experience led directly to my first real full-time job. Using public
transportation, the commute would have taken at least two hours each way. With
my parents’ car and two different highways, however, I was able to get there in
about 30 minutes and park for free.
Transportation equity is directly tied to land-use planning decisions. Locating the
new SUNY Buffalo Campus in the suburbs rather than the city led to a cascade
of transportation and development impacts. Millions of dollars in transportation
infrastructure connected the campus to the region. Student and faculty housing
was created on and around the suburban campus instead of in the city. Money
was spent on new buses to get students from the city campus to the suburban
campus—money that could have been spent elsewhere. For those not living on
campus, walking and biking to school became next to impossible.

live, and as we learned in the history
section, these have a lot to do with the
color of your skin. The same policies and decisions that built U.S. cities and
metropolitan regions around cars also set up the conditions for today’s
transportation disparities. When we read about the history of American cities and
suburbs we learned that white families were able to use FHA loans to buy
affordable homes in newly developed suburbs, while Black and Native American
families were denied the use of these loans. Black families were forced to remain in

families were not able to use FHA loans to build homes on reservations, and were

thus unable to build wealth through homeownership. This left most Black and
Native American families in the city or on the reservations with few financial
resources. White families in the suburbs were able to build wealth through

homeownership and had enough resources for at least one car. As the tax base
shifted from cities to suburbs, available urban resources declined. Even if kids in
urban areas could walk to school, their walk might not be as safe and that school
would have a lower budget than a suburban school that was accessible by foot.
Along with the FHA loans, the Federal Highway Act of 1956 was central to the shift
from city to suburbs. This policy transformed billions of taxpayer dollars (combined
with state allocations and user fees) into high-speed connections between new
suburban housing developments and urban job centers. Starting in the 1960s and
continuing today, companies also moved their headquarters from the city to the
suburbs (where most of their executives lived), shifting thousands of jobs with
them.

free education that allowed him to shift from his job in the steel mill to teaching. The jobs
paid about the same, but when the steel mills in Buffalo, NY, laid off 60,000 people in the
1970s and 1980s, the shift in jobs made possible through the GI Bill meant our family
remained financially stable. Other families never recovered. At that time many Black
veterans did not have the same opportunities to use GI Bill funds. See Katznelson, I. (2005).

about who does or who does not benefit from transportation projects (in terms
of economic, social, educational, and health outcomes, for example), who does or
does not bear the burden of increased public transportation costs, and who does
or does not have a say in transportation decisions.
Let’s start by looking at who does and who does not have good access to
transportation options. People who cannot afford a car (or gas), who are too young
or old to drive, or whose physical disabilities prevent them from driving all depend
on public transportation to meet their daily needs. Changes in routes or schedules
impact transit-dependent people more than those who have access to a car. If your
commute goes from half an hour to two hours because of a change in bus routes,
you have less time with your family, higher child care costs, and less time to go to
school or work. If you are late to work because the bus schedule is inconsistent, you
may lose your job. If you are only able to apply for positions on or near a transit route
you may miss out on better opportunities in suburban office parks, or be unable to
work nights or weekends when bus service is typically limited.

spend about 19% That leaves middle-income families with an extra 21% of their
budget to spend on other things like education, healthcare, and entertainment.
Current government transportation budgeting, however, favors wealthier riders
and drivers. Spending on car-centered infrastructure, suburban buses, and
commuter rail well outweighs spending on city buses.
Motorists have been the primary beneficiaries of federal and state
transportation investment. A total of 80% of federal transportation dollars
goes toward highways, while all other modes of travel compete for the
remaining 20% (Rubin, 2009, p. 22).
It’s ironic that low-income people, who spend the largest portion of their incomes
on transportation, disproportionately subsidize wealthier public transit riders.

Transportation equity researcher Robert Bullard puts it this way: a “‘reverse Robin
Hood’ policy operates in many transit systems where the meager resources of
poor, transit-dependent riders are used to subsidize affluent transit riders” (Bullard,
2003, p. 1197). These subsidies are often justified as ways to reduce the number of
suburban car commuters.

projects are typically big and costly,
involving lots of land and money. Think
about the amount of space and capital needed to construct or repair a highway.
Even smaller-scale projects that make it easier for cars to move through cities
frequently make it harder and more dangerous for pedestrians, cyclists, and transit
users to get around. From this perspective, transportation equity is closely tied to
health and environmental equity. Expenditures that favor car transport over public
transportation result in higher emissions and poorer air quality. Low-income
neighborhoods are more likely to be located near major roadways, and these
residents suffer disproportionately from air pollution burdens such as increased
asthma. Unsafe pedestrian crossings and a lack of safe bike routes can lead to
collisions with vehicles. Low-income people are twice as likely to be killed while
walking than higher-income people. African Americans and Latinos are two times
4
as likely to be killed while walking than Whites. Those who rely on public
transportation may not have easy access to grocery stores and may have to shop at
convenience stores with fewer healthy food options.
Transportation equity is also about who is able to participate in decisions about
service and infrastructure. What recourse do you have if your bus line is slated
for reduced service? What if there are no benches or safe crossings near your
stop? Who do you call if the air quality is so bad that your elderly neighbors have
trouble being outside in the summer? What if a new highway is slated to run
through the middle of your neighborhood? What if a new rail line is proposed
through your neighborhood but won’t be stopping there? How do you know that
your input was taken into account? How can you find out who else cares about
these issues? Do you have any legal recourse? A study of Metropolitan Planning
Organizations, the groups with the most say in how billions of transportation
dollars are spent in many U.S. regions, showed a disproportionately high number

of white suburban committee representatives. Furthermore, representatives are
appointed, rather than directly elected by the people their decisions impact.
The siting of the SUNY Buffalo Amherst Campus, the location of my first internship,
was highly controversial. A broad and diverse coalition of members of campus
and community groups and both local newspapers argued for a site near Buffalo’s
downtown, which was already feeling the economic impacts of suburbanization. A
city location would have been much easier for people without cars to access, and
closer to low-income neighborhoods. Nevertheless, the suburban location won out
and campus construction began in 1968. The impacts of this decision—the shift
of millions of dollars of resources and increased spending on new vehicle access
routes, including expanded expressways to and from campus—are still felt today.
Many public universities in the U.S. that

back downtown. SUNY Buffalo, for
example, recently built a new medical
school complex downtown. In response to lessons learned from uniformly carcentric decades, urban designers, city planners, and real estate developers have
focused new energy and ideas on making walkable, bikeable, transit-rich urban
neighborhoods. In cities like Minneapolis and St. Paul, though, we still spend much
more on car infrastructure, and plans for city bike systems that connect to buses
and light rail are high priorities for city officials. Who these efforts are for, however,
remains an important question. Which neighborhoods are getting these
amenities? Who benefits?
Two moments in the history of the Rondo neighborhood of St. Paul, Minnesota,
illustrate the importance of understanding how major transportation projects
impact low-income neighborhoods: the construction of Highway I-94 and the
construction of the Green Line Light Rail Transit (LRT). The I-94 story has no silver
lining, and its effects continue to burden Rondo residents while benefiting car
users. The LRT story, in contrast, illustrates the power of coordinated community
action to shift public policy towards equity.
St. Paul’s mainly African American Rondo neighborhood had a thriving economy
and strong cultural community in the decades before and after World War II. But
in the late 1950s, as part of the Federal Highway Program, plans were made for
a connection between the two downtowns of Minneapolis and St. Paul and out
to the eastern and western suburbs. Rather than an alignment within an existing
railroad right of way to the north along the industrial corridor of Pierce Butler Drive,
transportation planners chose one cutting through the middle of Rondo, a choice
which ultimately destroyed hundreds of homes and small businesses.
28 | Kristine Miller, Ph.D.

Rev. George Davis tried his best to stay in his home. When he refused to move,
authorities forcibly removed him. Police arrived at the preacher’s house bearing
axes and sledgehammers, a sight that caused his 13-year-old grandson to cry.
“They were knocking holes in the walls, breaking the windows, tearing up the
plumbing…,” recalled Nathaniel Khaliq, now 66, who is Davis’ grandson. “I was
crying because it looked like something bad happened” (Yuen, 2010).
The impacts of the I-94 location went beyond physical destruction. As the federal
highway program and FHA loans pulled white Minnesotans away from the city,
residents who remained in Rondo suffered the impacts of a diminished tax base,
abandoned properties, and disinvestments in schools and other public programs.
They were also left with the ongoing health impacts of air pollution from car
emissions.
Today, former and current Rondo residents commemorate their neighborhood
through Rondo Days, an annual parade and festival that draws thousands of
participants, many of whom grew up in homes that were demolished for the
freeway. A new commemorative plaza (https://www.aia-mn.org/rondocommemorative-plaza/) on Concordia Avenue, a frontage road for I-94, interprets
Rondo’s history and the history of how the federally funded highway system cut
through many other Black neighborhoods across the U.S.
Forty years later, Rondo was at the center of another transportation equity
controversy with national implications. Planning began in earnest in 2001 to
connect the downtowns of Minneapolis and St. Paul with light rail transit along an
eleven-mile stretch of University Avenue. The Green Line was the biggest piece of
public infrastructure added to the neighborhoods since the construction of I-94.
No transit stops were planned in the most transit-dependent neighborhoods along
University Avenue, including the bulk of Old Rondo. Stops for Us, a campaign led
by a deeply diverse coalition including Rondo residents and leaders, won a victory
for transportation equity that benefited thousands of residents and businesses
and shifted federal transportation policy towards a more socially just model. As
a result of their, work three additional stops were constructed: on Victoria, Dale,
and Western Avenues. Rondo residents, some whose parents and grandparents
fought I-94, joined forces with residents of nearby Frogtown and transportation
equity advocates to win the stops, and to win support for small business owners
who faced traffic disruptions and loss of parking during and after construction.
Stops for Us allies rightly framed the uneven negative impacts of the
implementation of the Green Line as an equity issue. Gaining the stops was a hardwon victory requiring multiple tactics: lobbying public officials, researching station
locations and demographics, leveraging the National Environmental Policy Act
process, drafting state legislation, monitoring public meetings, testifying at public
hearings, and implementing a media strategy. The movement benefited from the
Introduction to Design Equity | 29

involvement of community leaders experienced in civil rights and social justice,
and from the broad range of culturally specific organizations along the corridor.
In 2010, the coalition won the Environmental Protection Agencies Environmental
Justice Award,
….for its efforts to form a broad-based partnership to secure the construction
of three new light rail transit stations, which will provide access for the transit
dependent communities of East University Avenue, connecting residents to
housing, jobs, education and the many amenities located throughout the
Twin Cities metropolitan region. (US EPA, 2010)
I-94, however, remains a barrier and health hazard for Rondo residents. They still
hope to find ways to remedy the destruction, and are advocating today for options
including new pedestrian bridges and/or a highway “lid” that would cover I-94 with
new green space. Examples of highway lids can be found as close as Duluth and
as far away as Seattle. Rondo residents are also concerned that the Green Line is
leading to increases in rent and tax assessments for long-time residents who may
need to move out of the neighborhood.
As you will read in the next chapter, information equity, like health and
transportation equity, is key to ensuring fair and just access to opportunities and
resources for everyone.

Chapter 6 - Information Equity

St. Paul residents planning for renovation of the Victoria Theater.
Thai Phan-Quang, photographer.

Think of all of the points in your day today when information has mattered—from
the simplest kinds to the most complex. To get to work or school today you had to
know what time it was, how to get there by bus or car or foot, what the weather
was going to be like, if there was traffic. To register for classes, you needed to know
what classes were being offered and at what times, what prerequisites you might
need, where and when the classes would be held, and if the professor was any
good. Access to accurate, useful information is central to everything we do. Thanks
in part to the internet and smartphones, accessing information has become so
simple that it is easy to forget its significance.

need to live a healthy life? To secure
health insurance for their family? To
help a loved one who is sick? To deal with a chronic illness? How can people know
the information is accurate? What if your health insurance company no longer
covered an important medication you or someone in your family relied on? Who
would you call?
Beyond individual interests, our entire democracy depends on an active and
informed public that has the information needed to participate:
Democratic political systems…make claims to legitimacy partly on the basis
of their citizens’ ability to seek and obtain reliable, credible information about
issues that affect them, information that allows them to interact with other
citizens and with their governing institutions….no social arrangements,
indeed, no culture or society, can exist without information….a primary
requirement for a “good society” is equitable information access and use.”
(Lievrouw and Farb, 2003, pp. 504–505)
In other words, if people in a society do not have access to information they need
to advocate for their interests, that society is not really a democracy.
Let’s use another health equity example to discuss the relationships between
information, democracy, and equity. What if someone in your family developed
asthma because of the bugs or old carpeting in your apartment? What is your
landlord required to do? Most cities have laws that spell out your rights as a
tenant and the responsibilities of your landlord. But as a renter, you need to know
these laws exist and know where you can get a copy. You might also need help
understanding legal jargon or translating the document into your first language.
There are non-profit organizations that may be of help, but again, you would need
to find them. There may even be agencies at other levels of government, like a
county office of health that might help, but where would you begin your search?

…it’s not just the information
about the particular issue
that is important. People
also need information about
how democratic processes
work.

As Lievrouw and Farb state, it’s not just
the information about the particular
issue that is important. People also need
information about how democratic
processes work. Let’s say you worked
through the process on your own behalf
and wanted to advocate for clearer laws
so that other people wouldn’t have to
deal with what you went through. You
have a lot of information about why it is

important based on your personal experience, but would you know what
government agency or body has the authority to create programs for tenants’
rights? Would you know how their decisions get made? Are they elected officials
or appointed? Do they have public meetings? You would also need information to
find other people or organizations who shared your goals so you could organize.
If you have ever looked at a city website you have probably noticed that there
are meetings scheduled just about every day of the week in which decisions are
discussed and made about issues ranging from housing to education to
transportation to social services. What information would you need to actively
participate in those meetings? Depending on the meeting, you may need to know
about zoning, traffic safety, historic preservation, or parks funding. You would also
need to know about the processes those meetings follow. When are you allowed to
speak and what recourse do you have if the decision goes the other way? You also
need to feel comfortable speaking up. Who do you think is comfortable speaking
up in a public meeting? Who do you think people in power might be more inclined
to listen to or agree with? Who might not feel comfortable going to a public
meeting at all?
Government agencies and officials are not the only bodies that make decisions
that impact people’s ability to live the lives they want to live. Private corporations
may be accountable for decisions that impact access opportunities and resources.
What companies make decisions that impact your health care or credit score? Why
are there fewer grocery stores in your neighborhood? What kind of internet or cell
phone services can you choose from?
To unpack and understand all of the
issues at play in information equity, let’s
Information is central to

and social capital. Each describes a

information can change someone’s life.
First, let’s think broadly. Information is
central to what people call personal agency—whether or not you are able to live
the life you envision for yourself. Where do you want to be in five, 10, 20 years? Are
you considering graduate school, travel, starting a career, having a family, owning
a home? Now think about all of the kinds of information you will need to pursue
each goal. Where would you find that information? How would you know it was up
to date? Is it all available on the internet and do you have reliable access? Would
you “phone a friend” for advice?
The phone-a-friend example brings us to another key element of information
equity called social capital. Social capital is the benefit people derive from having
34 | Kristine Miller, Ph.D.

relationships with others. If financial capital is about how much money you have to
spend, social capital is about what kinds of personal relationships you are able to
1
tap to your benefit. Information is key to building social capital and is a key benefit
of having social capital—to finding and meeting and interacting with people who
will benefit you and offering them advice and support in return. Information is
also a key benefit of having social capital. Your social network is an information
resource—and the social networks of people in your network are also valuable. Has
a relative ever made a call to a friend for you about a job? Do you know someone
who is a nurse or doctor who gave you medical advice? Do you have an older
sibling or friend who taught you to drive?

How would you find other like-minded people to start a petition? What if banks
lobbied to raise interest rates on loans? How would you know that was happening
and where and how to stop it?
In addition to making decisions that impact our personal agency, corporations may
collect information about us without our knowledge and use that information to
shape our decisions and choices. At the most benign level, internet search engines
remember what products we have looked at and put them up in sidebars to entice
us to go back and buy them. In a now famous story, Target used a teenager’s
internet search history to determine that she was pregnant. Her father got his first
hint when a Target catalog of baby products came to the house addressed to his
daughter. Aware of how disturbed consumers were by these targeted ads, Target
dropped its strategy of including a selection of targeted products in an otherwise
general-seeming catalog (Hill, 2012). Other companies use similar information to
decide which products they do and do not want to sell you. The term “Weblining”
describes the practice of denying people opportunities based on their digital
selves. Your “digital e-score” can determine the prices and services you are offered:

1. The two are also related. Depending on the kind of social relationships you have, you may
have a better chance of finding out about a job or an apartment or other opportunity. A
Forbes article title sums it up this way, “Your Network Is Your Net Worth: 7 Ways To Build
Social Capital. Forbes article available at https://www.forbes.com/sites/bonniemarcus/2014/

Introduction to Design Equity | 35

FTC Data Broker Report: May 2014: “the scoring processes used in some
marketing products are not transparent…consumers are unable to take
actions that might mitigate the negative effects of lower scores, such as
being limited to ads for subprime credit or receiving different levels of service
from companies.” (Yu, Mierzwinski, Robinson, Yu, Llc, 2014, p. 30)
Your ability to access and control your financial information impacts every aspect
of your life. You may be able to find information on an affordable apartment to rent,
but if your credit rating is low because it includes incorrect information, you might
not be able to make it through the landlord’s screening process.
These are just a few examples of how the category of information equity includes
whether or not we have access to information and how our own personal
information is used. But we still haven’t set out a definition of information equity.
What is its goal? What does society look like when everyone has fair and just access
to information?
Can we summarize information equity
in this way—as having fair and just

equal access, let alone fair and just
access. “More affluent, better-educated,
or higher-status individuals and groups are found to have access to more
information sources, a wider range of media and content consumption choices,
and more online access than other groups” (Lievrouw & Farb, 2003, p. 513). Let’s say
that we were able to provide everyone with the same access to the same
information in the same format. Would that solve the problem? Would everyone
have personal agency, the ability to build and sustain social networks, and the
opportunity to participate in democratic society? It depends on what the
information is and whether or not everyone is able to understand and use it:
Information resources are valuable only insofar as they are meaningful or
useful to the people who have access to them. The ability to derive a benefit
from a resource depends to a great extent on people’s skills, experience, and
other contextual factors….Consequently, the task for researchers is to assess
the quality as well as the distribution of available resources, and whether and
how well people use them. (Lievrouw & Farb, 2003, p. 514)
So it’s not just having access to the information that matters. The information itself
must matter and be understandable to the people that need to use it, and people
must understand the processes—governmental or private—through which they
can advocate for their interests. If we think of environmental design as a set of
36 | Kristine Miller, Ph.D.

ongoing processes, we can track whether people have the information they need
to have a voice in these decisions.
In order for people to participate in these processes, what information is
important? First, people need to know that something is happening and what the
opportunities are for them to give input. If you are a soccer fan you may have heard
that the Minnesota Major League Soccer (MLS) is building a new stadium in the
Midway neighborhood of St. Paul just south of the GreenLine light rail. But the first
time many residents and business owners in the immediate neighborhood heard
about it was after the decision to locate the stadium had happened and when
planning was well underway.
Artist and community organizer Lula Saleh remembers when she first saw the
drawings for the new building and the changes to the streets and sidewalks
around it. “It was at a community meeting about something totally different and
someone from St. Paul brought these big images of what the stadium was going
to look like and people were shocked. It was the first time that they had heard
anything about a stadium and here were these big pictures of the design.” A longtime Midway resident summed up his concerns this way:
My immediate response is simply this: I need a lot more information before
I can endorse this plan.…I need to know more about the potential impact
regarding traffic and potential traffic congestion on the major streets that
would be traveled by customers of the stadium, potential interference with
emergency vehicles during stadium events, parking options for event
customers, air pollution…noise volume and the impact of that noise on the
neighborhoods within two miles of the stadium. We need more information.
(Melo, 2016)
In order to get current information to concerned residents and business owners,
and to connect them to decision makers, African Economic Development
Solutions (AEDS), a local non-profit business organization, convened a meeting
outside of the official public participation plan. They invited public officials and
an official representing the MLS Stadium, and opened the meeting by sharing a
report on the economic impact of African immigrants in Minnesota, establishing
the importance and value of the voices of the people assembled. Participants
asked lots of questions: Would the stadium lead to an increase in rents in the
neighborhood? Would it impact parking for local businesses? What about the
business owners who rented space in the shopping plaza that was set for
demolition in the next five years? On their website, AEDS followed up by sharing
dates of the next official meetings and articles written about the project.

Get a new pedestrian crossing or bus shelter? Who do you talk to? What are the
permits? Who else might have the same interest?
One organization using design to improve information equity is the Center for
Urban Pedagogy (CUP) in New York. Take a look at the project called Rent
Regulation Rights (at http://welcometocup.org/Projects/MakingPolicyPublic/
RentRegulationRights). What information equity issue were they trying to
address? How might this project impact people’s agency or social capital? With
whom did they partner to make this project happen? CUP is unique in that it
uses design processes and products, especially graphic design, to bridge the
information gaps that prevent New Yorkers from being able to advocate for
themselves around big equity issues like housing, transportation, and education.
In the next two chapters we will look at design processes to figure out how they
happen, who they benefit, and how design might be an important tool in creating
more equitable systems and places.

against a set of criteria before making a final decision. This is design. And while
the designs that non-professional designers create could be linked back to larger
equity issues (who has the final say, you or your roommate? Who decides what a
private space or a study space should feel like? What is the performance about?
Where is it held? Who is able to go? Whose interpretation of the “spirit of the event”
is right?), our concern here is with the relationships between equity and the work of
design professionals. Their decisions have the potential to impact the most people.
And some design professionals, like landscape architects and interior designers,
are licensed and legally required to serve the public good.
In the next two chapters, we will look at two related types of professional design
practices: design thinking and discipline-specific design. Design thinking is the
more generic practice, with specific processes that can be used by professionals
or by anyone looking for a creative way to solve a problem or come up with
a new idea. Fields of discipline-specific design include graphic design, interior
design, landscape architecture, architecture, apparel design, experience design,
systems design, and product design. Each discipline-specific design field has its
own design processes (though they are similar) and draws on its own areas of
expertise.

companies have emerged that offer
design thinking training and services to
corporations, organizations, and government agencies. IDEO, an international
design firm with over 700 employees, is the largest, with a portfolio of work that is
deep and diverse. Los Angeles County, home to the country’s largest voting district,
worked with IDEO to rethink its entire voting system. Help Glide, a software startup,
worked with IDEO to develop a watch band that captures photos and videos for the
Apple Watch. Design thinking services are also offered by non-profit design centers
like the Minnesota Design Center at the University of Minnesota (MDC). The MDC,
the Minnesota Department of Human Services, and the Future Services Institute
used a strategic design thinking process to approach the many systemic barriers
facing adults who live in corporate foster care facilities.
So how does design thinking work? Professionals use many different
processes—some with three steps, some with five or more, some with three big
steps that are then divided into smaller steps. Most use different words to describe
roughly the same activities, making it difficult to compare, and, for our purposes,
difficult to map the ways each design thinking process relates to equity. That said,
Introduction to Design Equity | 41

some design thinking processes are more established than others because they
are taught to students at places like Stanford’s Design School or MIT’s Design Lab.
Students from these programs have gone on to teach or to create big influential
design firms and to promote similar design thinking processes. Later in this
chapter we will dig into the design thinking process model developed by IDEO
leaders Tim Brown and Jocelyn Wyatt and described in the Stanford Social
Innovation Review.

made it all happen,” by Jo Szczepanska,
design thinking as a strategy for
problem solving emerged in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Early design thinking
approaches drew on methods of established and emerging professions as diverse
as engineering, architecture, industrial design, psychology, and computer science.
Initially developed as a way to tackle complex environmental and social issues,
design thinking today has become a sort of “umbrella term” that refers to any
multi-disciplinary, human-centered project involving research and rapid idea
1
generation. “Human-centered” means that the design team aims to find a solution
that fits the needs of the end user, not just the company or organization that hired
the designer to come up with a solution. The word “research” is used a bit loosely
in design thinking to mean gathering information needed to generate and test out
solutions and ideas and then critically evaluating that information in light of the
project at hand (though some design thinking projects may include social science,
ergonometric, or market studies that do generate new knowledge and contribute
to larger bodies of research). “Rapid idea generation” (sometimes called “rapid
ideation”) refers to the step in which a design team quickly generates lots of ideas,
tests them, modifies them, and re-tests them until the team and its clients believe
they have created a workable solution.
What happens after the design thinking is over? That depends on how much time,
money, and willpower is needed and is in place to make something happen. A
non-profit might use the results of a design thinking process to solicit support
from funders. A for-profit company might bring the ideas to its research and
development team. A city agency might put the ideas out for public input and to
generate support.

Social Innovation group. Their process
has been critiqued and adapted by
others to better fit social and racial equity goals, so we will spend some time here
talking through their ideas. For Brown and Wyatt (and in all of the design thinking
models), design thinking is not a linear path. Instead, it is iterative, looping among
three big activities that they label as inspiration, ideation, and implementation:
Think of inspiration as the problem or opportunity that motivates the search
for solutions; ideation as the process of generating, developing and testing
ideas; and implementation as the path that leads from the project stage into
people’s lives. (Brown and Wyatt, 2010, p. 33)
For Brown and Wyatt, inspiration is more than just being moved to create
something—more than feeling inspired, though that helps. Inspiration in this
design thinking process sets out the “Why?” behind the whole endeavor. What is
the issue or problem that the team is trying to address? What do they need to
know about that issue or problem? What constraints do they need to be aware
of? Goals and constraints provide a focus and framework for the design thinking
process called “the design brief” (sometimes called a “problem statement”).
In any design thinking process, the

focused enough for the team to dig in
without asking themselves “What are
we doing again?” all the time, but not so narrow that the outcome seems
predetermined. For example, if a design team starts off with a brief that says
“improve kids’ health,” they won’t know where to begin. But if a design team starts
off with a design brief that asks, “How can we encourage kids to be more physically
active?” they can start finding information about what works to get kids active now
or what is it about kids’ brains and attitudes that leads them to adopt or reject new
behaviors. They can pull together research articles, talk to kids, teachers, and
parents, and observe kids at recreation centers. The brief may also say that the
Introduction to Design Equity | 43

solution must be cheap to develop and use, giving the team additional criteria
to shape and evaluate their ideas. Every design brief is based on a set of implicit
assumptions about what is good and right and what kinds of information and
research are valid.
With a design brief and lots of background information to draw upon, the team
moves on to ideation. Ideation is a fancy word for coming up with ideas or
brainstorming. The goal here is to synthesize what the team has learned in the
inspiration phase into new insights about the problem or issue. Team members
may develop a set of “design principles” based on what they have learned so
far—such as, our solution needs to facilitate both group and individual play, or our
solution should work for students who do not have a computer at home. These
principles can be used to develop multiple solutions. Ideation involves divergent
thinking—generating many different solutions based on the same information.
You can think of it as a kind of informed brainstorming. The team then takes all of
their ideas and gradually sorts out the ones that best fit their project brief.

“moving backwards and then moving

solutions and in the process discover new information that may change the brief.
They adjust the brief and create another set of stronger ideas and move on from
there.

flimsy and goofy looking, but the process of making them and talking about them
leads to valuable insights and more refined prototypes, which in turn give the team
a stepping stone to help them move from a big idea to a more refined product.
There is something about taking an idea and making something physical and
tangible that sparks new ideas and also opens up new conversations in the group.
Prototypes are good conversation starters with clients or users, and can also help a
project team identify potential problems before rolling out their ideas.
“Prototyping in Design Thinking: How to Avoid Six Common Pitfalls,” by Rikke Dam
and Teo Siang, offers practical tips for prototyping which include: work quickly,
use cheap materials, don’t “fall in love” with what you make, and know that failed
2
prototypes can yield important insights. This video, by the Academy for Innovation
and Entrepreneurship at the University of Maryland, depicts the process of
prototyping. The team decides to use two prototyping methods—a physical
prototype and a role-play prototype to test out a system to improve the experience
of biking on campus. The physical prototype gives them a way of illustrating and
talking through the “Bike Buddy” system, while the role-play prototype allows
them to practice sharing the idea with real people. In this (now classic) video
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M66ZU2PCIcM), a team works through a
design process to create a better shopping cart, ending with a prototype that can
3
be tested out in a grocery store.
Depending on how well the prototyping goes, a team may move forward to
refining and further developing their idea or may find that they need to go back
to an earlier phase. In the shopping cart example, the team will likely refine the
idea further but keep the basic concepts. In the “Bike Buddy” example, the team
would likely take the feedback from talking with people and consider issues of
safety more carefully. Perhaps they would decide that the “buddies” need to go
through safety training and that biking in busy areas like Washington, DC, is too
big a jump for new riders with or without a buddy. When the team has created
what they feel is a workable design based on what they learned in the prototyping
phase, they’re ready to move forward with creating the final product or service. At
this point they would likely hand off their idea to a discipline-specific designer, like
a systems designer or landscape architect in the case of the bike-buddy idea, or a
manufacturing expert in the case of the shopping cart. They might also create a
communication strategy. Who needs to know about this new process or solution?
What is the best way to reach them?

and fair? In the next article you will read,
“From the Technical to the Political: Democratizing Design Thinking,” by Staton,
Kramer, Gordon, and Valdez, the authors discuss exactly that. Their goal is to
critique current design thinking processes and to explore the potential of design
thinking as a tool for equity and social justice. They argue that existing models of
design thinking often offer only technical fixes for problems that are rooted in
unjust economic systems. For instance, a design thinking process aimed at helping
people access healthy foods might suggest a new neighborhood grocery store
without asking whether or not people can afford fresh vegetables in the first place.
Their article proposes a new model for design thinking based on the IDEO model
but with three new foundational steps: reflect, democratize, and contextualize.

“Reflect” requires designers to examine
their positionality, “the extent to which

expert.
Gordon, Kramer, & Valdez, 2016, p. 10). In
this model, the designer is not a neutral
and objective expert. As we learned in Chapter 2, we all act from our own set of
cultural assumptions which “creates blind spots and opportunities to harm and/or
exclude design partners with less structural power…” (Staton, Gordon, Kramer, &
Valdez, 2016, p. 10). In addition to helping illuminate the potential for blind spots
and exclusion, an understanding of the multiple positionalities on a design team
can also show the potential for building understanding and inclusion among team
members. The more we understand about ourselves, the more we can find points
of contact with other people.
In my experience, the process of reflection is not a one-time act. If 70% of my
iceberg of experiences and assumptions is subconscious, it’s safe to assume that
identifying all of my blind spots is going to take time. Last week a good friend
of mine invited me to an introductory seminar on dismantling racism he was
attending. I thought, wow, this person teaches classes, including a session with my
own students on this issue. He is also African American. What more does he have
to learn? I brought this up with one of our mutual friends who said that she always
gets something out of these sessions because there are so many different ways
that our personal biases work—and in every session she finds another insight that
helps her better understand her own biases. Reflecting on one’s positionality can
help people understand that not having experienced something yourself doesn’t
mean that that thing isn’t real, and that what is considered “normal” or “good” is
not the same for everyone.
As we learned in Chapter 3, all design

they bring to the process, and to
uncover some of their limits and
strengths. In “How does your positionality bias your epistemology,” David Takacs
says that when we ask how who we are shapes what we know, we can also identify
and value our own experiential and intellectual assets:

Introduction to Design Equity | 47

By respecting the unique life experiences that each student brings to the
classroom—by asserting that the broadest set of experiences is crucial to

empower all students as knowledge makers….Rather than “tolerating”
difference, we move to respect difference, as difference helps us understand
our own view—and thus the world itself—better. From respect, we move to
celebration, as we come to cherish how diverse perspectives enable us to
experience the world more richly and come to know ourselves more deeply.
(Takacs, p. 28-29)
So how do you go about mapping your own positionality? Where do you even
begin? While it’s not often that designers or most people in general undertake
this kind of self-discovery, it is a common practice among researchers who study
human relations, behavior, and health. What we have been referring to as
positionality, most researchers call reflexivity. The Qualitative Research Guidelines
Project from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation gives a succinct introduction
to reflexivity. In it, you’ll find many similarities to what we talked about in Chapter
2 regarding culture and worldview. Reflexivity describes “an attitude of attending
systematically to the context of knowledge construction, especially to the effect
of the researcher, at every step of the research process” (Cohen & Crabtree, 2006).
Many researchers try to prevent bias by working with a team rather than as an
individual so that (often hidden) beliefs and values can be more easily identified
and discussed or contested. They examine and describe their background and
position (sometimes keeping a personal journal to reflect on their decisions), and
include a summary of how their potential biases may have impacted their research
in their reports and articles.
Designers can use similar methods, and
since design thinking typically involves a

The goal in these exchanges between
team members is not to come to some
kind of consensus about what is or isn’t the right world view for each member to
adopt. Instead, the goal is to foster the kinds of dialog needed to uncover and

families cannot afford to purchase fresh foods and do not have access to a kitchen
in which they can store and prepare fresh foods.
In the contextualizing step, designers examine the issue at hand in the context of
ongoing “struggles for identity, culture, place, and power” (Staton, Gordon, Kramer,
& Valdez, 2016, p. 10). In the example of a team working to come up with ideas
to increase physical activity among kids, team members need to understand the
context in which the kids live and how that context—economic, racial,
gender—might impact their ability to exercise. Think back to Chapter 3, to what we
learned about how cities and suburbs were built in the 20th and 21st centuries and
how that continues to impact family wealth and neighborhood vitality. Today some
children spend their afternoons at home alone until parents come home from
work, and are not allowed outside during that time because their neighborhood is
not safe. Contextualizing the design brief within the social and economic realities
of the people you are designing for (and hopefully with, but more on that later),
you will find constraints, but you will also find opportunities to create solutions
that work for lots of different people and a chance to push your creativity own selfunderstanding further.
The next step, democratizing, challenges the notion of who gets to be the designer
6
and who is designed for. Rather than seeing the design team as designing for
someone who needs their services to solve a problem they are facing, a
democratized design process values all participants as co-designers and values
community expertise and creativity.
Communities at the margins have been innovating as a matter of survival
and in the work of liberation since time immemorial. The very work of
navigating life between forces of exploitation, violence, and neglect requires
ingenuity in devising solutions around dominant social structures” (Staton,
Gordon, Kramer, & Valdez, 2016, p. 11).

…defining design as
something a singularly
creative person does and
then gives to someone else

So what is the role for the traditional
designer in a democratized design
process? Designers bring resources,
credibility, and influence…and offer a
structured set of tools through which
community members may focus their
creative potential if they so choose. This
is a big shift for designers who are

of design thinking. The terms participatory design and co-design are more commonly used

singularly creative person does and then
gives to someone else is limiting, even
for the “expert.” The designer loses an opportunity to develop new skills and learn
from people with different knowledge. What some might see as limiting their
creative process, others embrace as a chance to learn and grow.
What are the barriers and limitations to Design Thinking for Social Justice (DT
for SJ)? Time, money, and lack of trust are all seen as barriers to a social justice
approach to design thinking. There may not be enough time and money to see
a collaborative design-thinking process through. The more participants, the more
ideas generated. The more ideas generated, the more time it takes to develop and
evaluate those ideas. Design professionals are paid for their time as part of their
contract (with the institution or company that hires them to lead the process),
but community experts are often asked to participate as volunteers. This financial
barrier means that it’s more often middle and upper-middle income earners who
can be part of co-design teams because they are able to take time off of work and
hire someone to watch their kids. Some funders recognize this barrier and will pay
for things like gift cards, stipends, baby-sitting, etc. But it’s most often only the
professionals who are paid.
Even if participants from marginalized
communities are present, will they able If there is no money in place

and that there will be a concrete
outcome that helps solve the problems
they have helped to identify? If there is no money in place to implement the ideas,
has the exercise raised false hopes or wasted people’s time? Sometimes the design
process is seen as a way to generate ideas that can then be brought to funders for
implementation grants, but there are no guarantees. Is the time and energy that
people give to a design thinking exercise valuable even if the design itself cannot
be implemented? The authors see value in the design process because of the tools
and relationships that community members may tap into in the future, but note
that, in order for this to work, there need to be relationships and networks that exist
beyond any singular design exercise.
This adaptation of the IDEO framework takes on three of the big challenges of
equity-driven design: First, the challenge of educating design professionals about
the limits and strengths of their world views and experiences and about the value

of diverse problem-solving teams. Second, the challenge of educating design
professionals about the long-term patterns of disinvestment that underlie our
society and all design problems. And finally, the information equity challenge,
understanding whose knowledge counts and who must be part of design
decision-making.
The additional steps added at the front end also have the potential to create a
cascading effect on the steps that follow. How might the “inspiration” step, where
the team frames the problem, change if people directly impacted by the problem
are involved? As the team “contextualizes” the issue or problem, they may identify
a different set of issues that need to be addressed. Having explored their own
positionality/situatedness, they may be more open to ideas they may not have
previously understood or valued. They may come to the ideation phase with the
same brief, but may look at the same data and come up with radically different
ideas on what should happen.
The authors do see a weakness of DT for

authors propose that networks of designers and community members build
relationships over time, look for new projects to collaborate on, and support each

Their Venn diagram poses three interrelated questions: Who was involved in the

questions forward into the next chapter as we explore discipline-specific design
practices and their relationships to equity.

Chapter 8 - Discipline-Specific
Professional Design Processes
and Equity

Landscape Architecture students exploring Mill Ruins Park in Minneapolis

In this chapter we will explore the design processes used by discipline-specific
design practitioners like landscape architects, graphic designers, and interior
designers. We will talk through the series of steps they use to develop, test, and
implement their ideas, paying attention to the moments when their decisions may
impact people’s fair and just access to opportunities and resources.
First, let’s go over the differences between design thinking and the processes
used by discipline-specific designers. One way of distinguishing between design
thinking and discipline-specific design processes is through their products or

be an idea for a new app or wayfinding system or tent. In contrast, landscape

while a design thinking process does not necessarily end in a “ready-toimplement” solution, discipline-specific designers are expected to produce
drawings and specifications that can be used by a manufacturer, printer,
construction team, or programmer to create the final “product.” A design thinking
team may hand over their ideas to a discipline-specific design team to move their
idea along the path to reality.
The biggest differences between design thinking and professional design
processes are related to time, cost, and scope. While a design thinking process
might happen over the course of a day or a few weeks with a small budget to
cover drawing and prototyping supplies and food, and result in ideas or products
that are either fairly simple to implement or require handing off to a professional
designer to refine and make real, professional design processes can happen over
months or years and involve many different collaborators. Larger-scale professional
design processes, like creating a new riverfront housing development and park,
may involve a team of designers from different fields as well as other professional
consultants like engineers, planners, archeologists, public artists, ecologists, and
community engagement experts. Each team member has their own contract (or
sub-contract) and all must conform to local, state, and national regulations (usually
related to health, safety, accessibility, and environmental concerns).

This is important to our conversation for two reasons. First, because not everyone
has the financial and social capital to achieve licensure, these fields lack diversity.
Second, since many designers have amassed significant debt to pursue their
education, and jobs can be scarce during economic downturns, they may not feel
empowered to rigorously advocate for equity outcomes. We will look more at both
of these issues as we talk through the design process.

broad question in order to generate the
most ideas, like “How can we encourage kids to be more physically active?” A
professional design brief, in contrast, is intentionally narrow, since someone (the
city, a private client, a neighborhood organization, etc.) has already decided what
needs to happen. A professional design brief might say something like “we need to
redesign this specific park so that it supports a variety of physical activities for kids
of all abilities,” while the discipline-specific brief sets out the what—a building, a
brochure, a patient intake system, a park, etc.—and includes specific goals or
requirements like a timeframe and a budget. Creating the brief is called the predesign phase. A client may work with a designer experienced in pre-design to help

them create a well-defined brief. The narrow focus of discipline-specific design
briefs mean that individual projects do not address deep structural injustices.
As you can imagine, the pre-design phase is rich with equity opportunities and
challenges. Who decides what needs to happen and where? Who stands to gain?
Who may suffer the impacts? All of the challenges we learned about in earlier
chapters have a big impact on whether or not equity-driven design projects even
make it to the designers desk. Let’s say you’re in charge of communications for
a county social services agency and want to hire a web designer to help get the
word out about a nutrition program. If you have a computer and a smart-phone
at home, you might not consider that your web-based communications strategy
won’t work for most low-income families. You might assume that your strategy
wasn’t successful because people just don’t care enough about nutrition to email
back or that they don’t need the services since they haven’t signed up for them
online.

Or let’s say the decision to renovate an existing park is made by a city’s Department
of Parks and Recreation. How did they decide which parks get the resources?
Let’s say the decision is made by an individual property developer to create a new
apartment building. What, if any, rules does the city have requiring that some of
the units be affordable? Who has access to those units and how? Let’s say the
decision is made by a non-profit home for the elderly that wants to renovate their
lobby. Why are they fixing the lobby and not a part of the building more directly
tied to patient care?

not typically the designer deciding what jobs to take on, but the design firm leader.

4. But a lot of equity issues—like benefits and risks—are in place even before a design project
brief is written. In the case of a large-scale land development project, what can and can’t
happen on the site is already determined by something called zoning. Or there may be
other constraints on what can happen there based on who owns the property or on existing
planning documents.

So an individual designer working at a firm has the choice to work on the project
or find another job.
But let’s say a developer worked with a city to come up with a redevelopment
plan for a large river-front site. They want to include some affordable and marketrate housing and a new public park. They have a design brief and are looking for
designers to hire. On a project of that size they will most likely create a selection
committee. As you read about the selection committee, the request for
qualifications, the requests for proposals, and interview processes, do you see
any points where equity issues might arise? Who gets to be on the selection
committee and what values (rooted in their worldviews) do they bring? What
spoken and unspoken judgments are they basing their selection on? Do they value
the benefits of having a diverse group of creative problem solvers? Let’s say the
selection committee is committed to having a diverse group of designers with
experience in equity-driven design work on the team. How diverse is the city’s
pool of experienced designers? Who has the resources to go to school to be an
architect? Whose parents have the resources to help them out?
Once a design team is hired, members move through the steps of programming,
schematic design, design development, construction documentation, and
construction administration. To start, the designers gather additional information
about the project and its constraints (typically called site inventory and analysis). In
the case of a public park design, they may gather information on the park’s main
users, how people might get to the park, the types of soil at the site and whether
there is any contamination from a previous use, who lives in the neighborhood, the
amenities at other nearby parks, etc. What is considered important information on
which to base design decisions? Again, who is involved in the planning process?
How is information gathered? Which people are considered the main users of the
space? What conditions—environmental, social, economic, etc.—are considered
important for study? What methods are employed in the information gathering
and analysis phase?
In the case of publicly funded work there

people don’t believe their voices will be heard. For example, most first-generation

A friend whose parents came from a refugee camp in Thailand and who works
with immigrant business owners explained the challenge of building trust this way:
A lot of people come from places where any kind of authority is as much of
a problem as it is a benefit to you…anything either associated with the city
or imagined to be associated with the city is to be treated with suspicion. I

interactions. Trust is also central to design engagement processes. So how do
you build trust? Professional design teams and public agencies are increasingly
partnering with community artists to help plan and facilitate public engagement
meetings, or shifting from the format of a public meeting to having informal
conversations with people on-site. Community-rooted artists and organizations are
better able to broker relationships within groups and between groups and outside
structures like public agencies.
Let’s assume that the design team has worked with local artists and non-profits
to come up with an engagement strategy that reaches all of the people who
would be impacted by the project. At the meetings, everyone feels comfortable

sharing their ideas and criticisms. The designers gather all of the feedback and
take all of that information (plus all of the other information they have gathered)
and start making drawings and prototypes. In the case of buildings or community
designs, they will build models or generate computer models as a way to test
out their ideas. Often the designers will share those drawings and prototypes
to get additional feedback. Some ideas are carried forward, others can’t be
accommodated within the budget and construction timeline. The designers may
or may not incorporate all of what they heard in the public meetings, because it
may not fit the original brief, may be too costly, or may not be legally or physically
possible. How do the designers decide what is important? What if the client (the
developer and the city) has ideas that are at odds with what the designers heard
in the public meetings? What if the city’s goal is to increase tax revenue while
providing a minimum of access to the river, but the goal of community members is
to have lots of river access and less space for commercial use? The designers may
be able to accommodate both goals on the site, and this might mean that they
spend extra time (unpaid time) working out the logistics and redrawing their plans
to make it happen. Or it might not be possible to do both. Typically, the decision
goes to the city and the developer.
But let’s say the clients decide to go with what the community wants, or that the
designers find a way to accommodate both in their plan. Once the designers have
come to what they and their clients believe is the best fit, they generate a set of
technical drawings and digital models that can be used to build, print, code, etc.
the final design product. These drawings and models are extremely detailed. They
specify what materials will be used, the exact dimensions of the final products,
and how they will be built, and are used to hire contractors to build the final
products. Contractors are asked to submit bids for constructing the project based
on these drawings. The drawings become part of a legal contract between the
client, the designers, and the contractors. If it is a public project, the client may
be required to go with the lowest bid. In other situations, the client may use other
criteria to choose the contractor, like how much experience they have or where
they are located. The same equity issues arise here as they did with the selection
committee that hired the designers. Who decides? Who gets the contract? Is there
a requirement that a certain amount of the contracts go to businesses owned by
people of color? To businesses with a diverse staff?
During the construction or implementation phase, designers may act as on-site
supervisors to make sure the project is being built according to specifications and
to deal with any problems that come up. Even after the design work is completed
and the drawings are handed over to the contractor, designers are legally
responsible for making sure that contractors follow the design’s specifications. If
anything goes wrong, designers can be sued. Construction sites can be dangerous
places. Depending on what materials the designers specify, construction workers
may be exposed to toxic chemicals from adhesives or paints. To ensure safer

working and living environments, organizations like Healthy Building Network
provide information to designers and builders on alternatives to hazardous
materials.
Once construction is completed, designers sign off on the project to say that
everything has been built to their specifications (or their adjusted specifications, if
changes are needed along the way). The new park, community center, advertising
campaign, or hospital registration system is opened and designers move on to
9
their next projects. Of course, the reality of the design process is much messier
than this. Like design thinking—which can move back and forth from inspiration to
ideation to prototype many times before a solution is chosen—the design process
is also iterative.
From pre-design to construction/implementation, discipline-specific design
processes are tied to multiple equity issues, even more than the few pointed out
here. As a landscape architecture student back in the 1990s, I didn’t learn about
this side of the work. While some programs had a more community-driven focus,
most designers practicing today haven’t had the opportunity to think through the
ways in which their work can help create fair and just access to opportunities and
resources for everyone. In the past ten years, social justice has received renewed
attention at a batch of public interest design programs across the country where
students, faculty, and practitioners are teaming up to address the gap between
our professional pledge to serve “the public good” and the reality that the public
we have been serving best is mainly white and often affluent. These programs are
partnering with non-profits and municipalities to build community gardens, share
information about proposed changes to transportation systems, rethink bus stops,
and advocate for better and more affordable housing. Not all of these programs are
new; many can trace their roots back to the 1970s, when designers began thinking
about their role in social justice movements.
Professional networks for equity-minded designers are also springing up, some
tied to a specific city and others national or even international in their membership.
The Design Justice Network (http://designjusticenetwork.org/network-principles/),
the Environmental Justice Professional Practice Network of the American Society
of Landscape Architects (https://landscapearchitecturemagazine.org/tag/socialjustice/), and Colloqate (https://colloqate.org/about/) are just a few.

9. Further equity issues arise after a project is constructed. Once a project is designed and
built, how is it managed? Who has access to the site? Who is responsible for its maintenance
and operation? How are future changes to the site handled? How, if the private sector is
involved, are things like public access monitored? Who is kept out of the site? Under what
circumstances? What codes of conduct will be developed for the site? How will they be
enforced? Will there be security cameras? Private security guards?
