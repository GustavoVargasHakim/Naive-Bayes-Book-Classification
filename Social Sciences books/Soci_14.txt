Mercator projection. One of the first maps of the world developed was by Mercator (Carta do Mundo de Mercator,
1569).

1. Maps, Society, and Technology
Steven Manson and Laura Matson

People have long used maps, from scratching their worldview on clay tablets thousands of years
ago to people today creating sophisticated web-based maps to change their societies. Alongside
nanotechnology and biotechnology, the White House touts mapping as one of the three most
important industries of the 21st century, and one that accounts annually for a trillion dollars of
economic activity. Mapping is an essential form of inquiry across the arts, humanities, and sciences
that uses geospatial technologies to gather data on people and places. Mapping
technologies—ranging from the earliest forms of drawing on clay tablets to modern satellite imaging
and sharing information on web-based social networks—spring from and play out in a social context,
exemplifying the interplay of society and technology.
This book is about how to read, use, and create maps. Our exploration of maps will be informed by a
contextual understanding of how maps reflect the relationship between society and technology, and
how mapping is an essential form of scientific and artistic inquiry. We will also explore how mapping
is used to address a variety of societal issues, such as land use planning and political gerrymandering
to selling yoghurt. You will gain insight into the technical underpinnings of mapping as a science
approach, complement on-going interest and activities, or provide an applied focus for research or
policy.
This chapter will introduce you to:
• Basic social and technical elements of maps
• A very short history of mapping
• Mapping and liberal education
By the end of this chapter, you should be able to identify basic characteristics of mapping, its history,
and important ways that mapping, society, and technology interact.

1.1 Maps, Society, & Technology
The standard or dictionary definition of a map usually revolves around the idea that a map is a
representation, usually on a flat surface, of an area. The Wiktionary, for example, defines a map as
“a visual representation of an area, whether real or imaginary.”

4 Mapping, Society, and Technology

This definition is not very useful on its own, so in order to figure out what maps are about, we usually
instead look at what maps do.
In particular, maps:
• Show an area larger than we can see. Most often this view is from above but not always.
• Present information concisely, especially the features of most interest to the user.
• Demonstrate spatial relationships.
• Show things we cannot see directly, such as minerals below ground or records of daily
temperatures.
It is also helpful to look at kinds of maps in addition to what they do. We can distinguish between
two major kinds of maps: reference maps and thematic maps.
Reference maps store data and show a variety of features for variety of uses. These maps function
like general store houses of information. The figure below is a reference map of China because it
stores a variety of information, including transportation routes, rivers, and names of water bodies.

1. Maps, Society, and Technology 5

Reference map of China. This map is considered a reference map because it shows many different features of interest,
such as rivers, roads and boundaries. 1

Thematic maps highlight specific themes. Their chief goal is to focus the user’s attention on
specific features or characteristics. The figure below has two thematic maps that each draw the user’s
attention to a single idea or theme. The other information, such as the outlines of states, is only
provided to help understand the main theme—vegetation and population, respectively.

6 Mapping, Society, and Technology

Thematic maps of Thailand. These maps are considered thematic because they focus on a single item or theme. On the
left is a categorical thematic map showing nominal classes of vegetation in 1974, and on the right is a quantitative
thematic map showing ordinal classes of population density in 1974. 2

Regardless of whether a map is thematic or reference, it is essentially a technology in that it is
the manifestation of knowledge gained from many fields and forms of knowledge. These include
cartography, land surveying, remote sensing, computer science, information science, and social
science. A map is also a social entity, in that society affects everything from the underlying data used
in the map through how it is processed into information, converted into knowledge about the world,
and ultimately turned into intelligence that is used for action.

1. Maps, Society, and Technology 7

1.2 A Very Short History
The history of mapping is long, rich, and complicated. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of
books on the history of mapping and maps. Here, we look at a very general outline; note that we are
only looking at a few representations, and are focusing primarily on European and North American
maps. There are long histories of mapmaking in most regions of the globe. In thinking about maps,
it helps to distinguish between literal maps, which were meant to show actual things and places, and
figurative maps, which show conceptual or imagined places.
Early Maps (25000 BCE+). People have probably been scratching maps into dirt with sticks for
longer than they have been using words. The figure below shows a few maps made in around 600
BCE (Before Common Era) that traces relationships between cities and mythical places and ideas.

8 Mapping, Society, and Technology

Babylonian Map of the World. This map traces relationships between cities and mythical places and ideas (~600 BCE). 3

Greeks (800-100 BCE). The Greeks were producing fairly high-quality and accurate (so, literal)
maps of the region around the Mediterranean Sea and were among the first peoples to discover earth’s
circumference. Eratosthenes (276-195 BCE) is widely credited for this achievement.

4

Medieval Maps (1100-1400s). In Europe during the Dark Ages, maps took a turn towards the
figurative, often in aid of advancing religious viewpoints of the world. An example is the T and O
Map below, where the T is the Mediterranean, the Nile, and the Don Rivers dividing the continents of
Asia, Europe and Africa; and the O represents the encircling ocean. Given its religious significance,
Jerusalem was generally placed in the center of the map and because the sun rose in the east, Paradise
(representing the Garden of Eden) was considered as being in remote Asia. This map captures aspects
of reality, such as the relative locations of water bodies and continents, but is a step back from past
maps in terms of realism.

10 Mapping, Society, and Technology

T and O map. This map by Isidore of Seville where the T is the Mediterranean, the Nile, and the Don Rivers dividing the
continents of Asia, Europe and Africa; and the O represents the encircling ocean. 5

At this time, non-European cartographers were developing literal maps. Abu Abdullah Muhammad
al-Idrisi al-Qurtubi al-Hasani as-Sabti, or simply Al-Idrisi (1100–1165), was an Arab geographer,
cartographer and Egyptologist who lived in Sicily at the court of King Roger II. He travelled the
Mediterranean world and developed advanced maps of the world, like the one here.

1. Maps, Society, and Technology 11

Al-Idrisi’s map of the world. Al-Idrisi was a geographer, cartographer and Egyptologist who lived in Sicily at the court
of King Roger II. He traveled the Mediterranean world and developed advanced maps. 6

Age of Exploration (late 1400s+). European countries embarked on a period of exploration in the
1400s that reshaped the world. Many nations from around the globe had intrepid explorers before this
time, but this period saw a rapid increase in maps being made for the explicit purpose of navigation.
Chinese cartographers were developing maps for navigation but also as a way to understand history,
as below, where Ch’üan Chin and Li Hui developed the Map of Historical Emperors and Kings and
of Integrated Borders and Terrain.

12 Mapping, Society, and Technology

Historical map. Chinese cartographers developed this map in 1402 of historical empires, borders, and terrain. 7

The Cantino Map, shown below, is one of the earliest surviving maps showing Portuguese
discoveries around the world. It is named after Alberto Cantino, who successfully smuggled it
from Portugal to Italy in 1502. The Cantino Map, like others of its kind at the time, held military,
political, and economic significance. Given that such maps were being used to sail ships and lay
claim to places, mapping became more concerned with providing literal and accurate representations
of reality.

1. Maps, Society, and Technology 13

Cantino Planisphere. Portuguese discoveries as of year 1502. 8

Thematic Mapping (late 1600s+). From the 17th century onward, more people made thematic maps.
As discussed above, thematic maps focus on a particular idea or theme, as opposed to serving
multiple goals as a reference map. The map below shows travel flows out of Dublin and was one of
the first maps designed to convey a sense of flow or movement, namely, where the width of lines
were proportional to the number of passengers travelling by rail.

14 Mapping, Society, and Technology

Rail flows out of Dublin. One of the first maps that conveys a sense of flow or movement (1837). The width of lines are
proportional to the number of passengers travelling by rail. 9

Analytical Mapping (1800s+). Related to thematic mapping is analytical mapping, where maps are
used to explore the role of location and space to answer questions. One the most interesting early
examples of analytical mapping was the case of John Snow, an English physician. He investigated
the outbreak of cholera in London in 1854. At the time, no one knew it was a water-borne disease.
Dr. Snow spoke with residents and determined that many of the afflicted were drawing water from
a public well in Broad Street. He established that people with the disease were clustered around the
pump and convinced the authorities to discontinue its use. Dr. Snow is credited as being among the

1. Maps, Society, and Technology 15

first scholars to consider how a spatial pattern could result from a specific process and to produce
maps about his findings.

Snow’s map of cholera. John Snow developed this 1855 map to investigate a Cholera outbreak. The Broad Street Pump
is circled in red. 10

Geographic Information Science (1960s+). The advent of computing in the 1940s and 1950s led
quickly to the foundation for the use of computers in mapping. A Geographic Information System
(GIS) is a computer system used to store, display, and analyze spatial information. The field
concerned with this use of computers became known as Geographic Information Science (GIS) and
has become synonymous with mapping for many practitioners, although technically Cartography is
considered the art and science of making maps. As we examine later in the text, GIS can be used
to make some truly terrible maps while a cartographer can make beautiful and useful maps using
a variety of approaches. GIS excels at bringing together many layers of data for a location and
conducting sophisticated analysis.

16 Mapping, Society, and Technology

GIS layers. These maps show attributes for part of the state of Wisconsin, United States. Geographic information
systems are very helpful in that they allow investigators to store, manipulate, and analyze data on a large variety of
phenomena. 11

1.3 Maps & Liberal Education
Liberal education explores how creative insights and knowledge are acquired and used, as well as
how they change over time. Mapping is an important way of knowing and changing the world.
Liberal education engages you, as both a student and a global citizen, through multiple forms of
learning that include reading, fieldwork, group experiences, lab work, writing, and other creative
activities. These are important components of a broader education that gives you the ability to see
multiple sides of an issue, develop critical reasoning abilities, and create an ethical compass to guide
you in your lifelong participation in society as a knowledgeable, thoughtful, and engaged citizen.

1. Maps, Society, and Technology 17

1.3.1 Inquiry and Mapping
Artists, scientists, and policy makers are among the many people who use mapping technologies
to describe and analyze human experiences and behavior. We examine how individuals and
organizations use maps, both as tools and objects of analysis.
Mapping relies on a number of fundamentals, from data collection to science approaches, ranging
from mapping data, using symbolization to best represent data, simplifying and classifying data via
visual and statistical methods, and then finally analyzing data and maps with a range of methods.
We identify key mapping resources and evaluate their quality. We examine the science and policy
dimensions of data and mapping technologies in order to better understand their promise and pitfalls.
More broadly, we discuss the role of various individuals and organizations in providing map-based
analyses on a range of issues.
We examine the roles that individuals play in their cultural, social, economic, and political worlds.
We ask questions about what surveillance practices mean for individuals and society one week, for
example, while in another we consider how individuals can take advantage of the ubiquity of mobile
mapping technologies to change the way they understand and effect change in the world. Mapping
offers a multidisciplinary framework with which to understand a range of local, national, and global
issues. It also involves engaging in a process of critical evaluation of maps produced by various
individuals, social groups and researchers.

1.3.2 Society, Technology, and Mapping
We examine the measurable impacts mapping technologies have on society. Mapping is a trilliondollar enterprise that fuses fast-evolving technologies with rapidly changing societal practices. What
does it mean for individuals and society that most mobile phones and many web-applications like
Facebook can track your location in a way that was not possible just a few years ago? Should the
government track our every movement? Should parents or schools track their children? Companies
their employees or customers? These are not hypothetical questions. Tens of millions of people are
being tracked right now, including you if you are reading this on a computer or phone or any other
internet-connected device.
We examine the science and engineering behind mapping technologies to better understand their
promise and pitfalls. How does GPS tracking work, and what are the limitations of its functionality?
Importantly, are these limitations clear to its users? How do crowd-sourced maps compare to more
traditional atlases in their accuracy and adaptability? How do these different methods of gathering
mapped data affect the way these maps are used?

18 Mapping, Society, and Technology

We discuss how society has fostered the development of mapping technologies. What does it mean
that mapping technologies such as satellite imaging of the earth, GPS units, or the spatially-aware
internet owe their existence and continued evolution to military research?
We examine how various social groups put mapping technologies to use. We explore how maps
are used in many ways, including to tell lies, sell products, win elections, and save lives. We look
at mapping from multiple perspectives, from developers of technology to users and other people
affected by the technology. Mapping is a useful lens through which to understand interactions
between society and technology, as mapping technologies are driven by social imperatives and these
technologies in turn change with society.

1.4 Conclusion
Mapping is an essential form of inquiry across a wide range of domains. Mapping also represents
the interplay of society and technology, which has been going on for thousands of years. From
the earliest forms of writing to modern satellite imaging and web-based social networks, mapping
methods spring from, play out in, and shape our social context.
With the advent of GIS, people experience how spatial data, analysis, visualization and thinking
are transforming our society in myriad ways. Billions of people use technologies such as Global
Positioning Systems (GPS), Google Maps, Yelp, and Uber. Governments use mapping to identify
crime hot-spots, plan social interventions, and identify routes to evacuate vulnerable populations
from harm. Companies use spatial analysis to site stores, evaluate supply chains, and determine
how much to charge for goods and services. Researchers combine spatial data gleaned from maps,
satellites, smart phones, sensor networks, and social media. They help commuters plan how to
minimize travel time; farmers to best plant and protect crops; epidemiologists to identify emerging
disease hot-spots; emergency planners to develop smarter evacuation routes; policy makers to
visualize spatiotemporal climate-change scenarios; and first responders to use high-resolution
imagery to map areas of need.

2. Data
Melinda Kernik and Dudley Bonsal

When admiring a well-designed map, it is easy to forget that it is made from data that came from
somewhere. An individual or group of people has asked one or more questions, gathered data in
response, and processed the raw numbers before putting it all on the map. These data are necessarily
just a small portion of what can be measured, because it is impossible to measure all characteristics
for all places for all times. Instead, we focus on how and why data were collected for what, where,
and when.
This chapter will introduce you to:
• Elements and common types of spatial data.
• Metadata, or data about data.
• How data in the US census – a survey that underlies many of the examples and activities
in this book – are collected and aggregated.
Resolution, accuracy, and interoperability – important concepts that are part of metadata and are
important to keep in mind when choosing appropriate data for a project.
By the end of this chapter, you should be able to ask thoughtful questions about the data used in
mapping.

2.1 What are Spatial Data?
Map data have three key characteristics:
• Spatial – where an object is located or an event has occurred
• Temporal – when the location and attributes were accurate (i.e. when collected)
• Attribute – what characteristics the object or event has
Imagine we have data about US states. Spatial characteristics of data, namely location of state
boundaries, are necessary to put the data on a map or use. More broadly, spatial information can take
the form of street address, latitude-longitude coordinates, or the area in which data was collected
(e.g., residential block, city, state, country). Temporal characteristics refer to how data represent a

22 Mapping, Society, and Technology

“snapshot” of what things were like at the time the data were collected, such as census data from the
year 2000. Finally, attribute characteristics describe the nature of a location. In the case of the states,
we could be concerned with population or income or any of hundreds of other characteristics.

Data table and map. This attribute table and linked map show state boundaries with data from the U.S. Census Bureau
on population density. The table and map represent two key elements of spatial data: location and attributes. A third
important piece, not shown, is the time at which these data were collected. 1

2.2 Collecting Spatial Data
Two main methods of spatial data collection, or gathering information about places, are ground
surveying and remote sensing. Ground surveying involves a person or mechanism observes or
interacts with people or the environment in a particular place. Remote sensing refers to collecting
data from afar, often by taking pictures from a plane or satellite.

2.2.1 Ground Surveying
Ground surveying is conducted through an individual or mechanism interacting with a particular
place.. This can include a person collecting locational data with a handset that works with a global
positioning system (GPS), a constellation of satellites that beam signals to earth where they can
be used to determine position. Surveys involve talking to people or traveling to different locations
to gather information. Another kind of ground surveying occurs at weather stations that measure
temperature and other climatological information at a given location. This is similar to a process
called geocoding, where data with a locational element such as an address or zip code, are matched
to their respective ground coordinates that are known already.

2. Data 23

Land surveying is one of the longest-standing methods of determining location. In essence, land
surveyors use a variety of tools to determine the precise positions of locations by triangulating from
the position of known locations, or in other words, using mathematics of angles and distances to find
locations. Surveying has existed for thousands of years, probably originating as a way to determine
the boundaries of land and help construct large buildings. From the 1800s onward, land surveyors
helped map out many countries, working outward from known to unknown locations.

Land surveying. The foundation for modern mapping was laid by people walking and measuring the land with
specialized telescopes (left) and modern GPS enabled total stations (right). 23

Global positioning systems (GPS) are constellations of satellites that orbit the earth. These satellites
transmit signals to the earth’s surface that indicate their position in space and a very precise time
signal. A device equipped with an appropriate GPS receiver can interpret these signals and determine
the device’s location on the earth. We consider using a GPS unit to find location a form of ground
surveying because the satellites themselves do not collect information; it is the handset or GPS unit
that is determining position from the satellite signals.

24 Mapping, Society, and Technology

GPS constellation. The Global Positioning System is a system, or constellation, of satellites orbiting the earth that allow
handsets to establish location. 4

For decades, locating objects accurately with GPS units required expensive equipment and
specialized training. It was undertaken primarily by the military, scientists, and government
organizations. With technological developments making computer chips smaller and faster, GPS
receivers are now standard in mobile phones. It is possible for any person to record, or tag, the
location where a picture was taken or track daily movements without special expertise. This ease of
use substantially expands who is able to create spatial data and the amount of spatial data that exists
and must be stored.

2. Data 25

GPS have their drawbacks. Since handsets must receive signals from satellites orbiting the earth,
these signals can be blocked by solid objects, such as trees, buildings, or landscape features such as
the sides of tunnels or ravines. Getting a strong signal in a moderately forested area can be difficult,
as can getting one in a city with tall buildings. There are a limited number of satellites orbiting the
earth, and there are times when the handset is in a non-optimal position relative to these satellites.
A GPS handset should receive signals from at least four satellites, and ideally more, that are spread
out evenly in the sky, but there are times when these sources are bunched up relative to the handset
position and the coordinates it provides will be inaccurate. Finally, depending on the quality of the
handset, GPS coordinates can also be inaccurate when the handset is moving quickly, such as in a
car or airplane. Note that, generally speaking, heavy weather such as snow, rain, or clouds do not
interfere with GPS signals.

26 Mapping, Society, and Technology

GPS handset. Handsets have specialized radios and computers that receive signals from GPS satellites and then
determine location. 5

Geocoding is the process of attaching a geographic location to some sort of address information,
such as a house address or zip code, or a verbal description such as “the intersection of Elm Avenue
and Main Street.” Geocoding takes a number of different forms, but most use some form of database
of addresses whose locations are precisely known. Unlocated addresses are matched to these known
addresses in the database.

2. Data 27

Geocoding involves matching street addresses to known addresses or best guesses based on ranges of street addresses
along streets already on a map. 6

Surveys gather attribute information about individuals, households, businesses, or areas. Not all
surveys collect spatial information, but when they do, the data can be linked to a location on a map.
Surveys can be mailed to households, gathered in person, or conducted over the phone. They usually
focus on a specific subpopulation or activity (e.g., students’ perceptions of safety walking home). A
census is a special type of survey that collects data on all members of a population (e.g., with the
goal of all inhabitants of a country). Note that survey information is usually attribute information,
and determining the location requires geocoding (as with a mail survey that records the address of
the person surveyed) or use of a GPS handset by the person taking a survey. Another kind of survey
occurs when companies like Google equip cars with GPS receivers and cameras and drive around
recording pictures of their surroundings.
Sensors. There is a growing number of sensors used to measure a wide array of human and
environmental facts. We have long had climate stations, for example, which measure many variables
including temperature, sunlight, and precipitation. The locations of these sensors are determined by
GPS, ground surveying, or geocoding.

28 Mapping, Society, and Technology

Climate observation station. Ground based stations such as these collect information on weather. 7

2.2.2 Remote sensing
As the name suggests, remotely-sensed data are collected at a distance from the object they are
studying. These data are usually collected by sensors mounted on airplanes, satellites, or drones.
Some sensors collect imagery with cameras that work on essentially the same principles as you would
find in a handheld film camera or digital cell phone camera. These cameras collect visible light that
human eyes can recognize. Other sensors detect different nonvisible parts of the electromagnetic
spectrum, such as infrared (heat). Still others can actively scan the earth with technology like radar.

2. Data 29

Satellite imaging. Painting of the Landsat 7 remote sensing satellite. Note that the satellite does not really cast a foursided beam of light upon the Earth’s surface, this is just artistic licence. Instead, the satellite’s sensors record
electromagnetic energy reflected or emitted by the Earth. 8

You have likely seen remotely sensed data as a basemap for Google maps or other online maps. This
imagery is also used for a wide array of purposes, especially monitoring changes in the environment
over large areas such as deforestation in the Amazon or oil spills.

30 Mapping, Society, and Technology

Mexico (May 24, 2010). 9

Photos are also taken by airplanes and drones. One of the most common uses is to take photos of the
earth’s surface. These photos are then converted by mapping professionals into maps of the ground.

2. Data 31

Aerial photogrammetry. Photogrammetry is the process of taking measurements of the ground from photos of the earth
in order to make the data necessary for maps. 10

2.3 Metadata
When working with maps, you will often use data that you did not create. Metadata helps you
determine whether the data on the map are appropriate for your question or project. Metadata are
data about data. We are usually most interested in spatial, temporal, and attribute data characteristics,
but metadata go further and provide information including:
• Who collected the data?
• How were the data collected and classified?
• When were the data collected?
• How accurate are the data?
• What is the resolution of the data? (More on this below!)
Be cautious using a map if you cannot find metadata. This caution is particularly important because
metadata lets you assess how well the data can work with other data. Below, we look at issues of

resolution, accuracy, and interoperability among datasets. Cartographers explore these issues and
then add them to the metadata attached to a map.

2.4 Census Data
An important form of survey data are census data, or those collected by national governments
on their populations. We use the example of census data collected by the United States Census
Bureau because the census is the primary source of social data used by government, nonprofits, and
businesses. These data are created using well documented procedures and are available at a variety
of scales for the entire nation. Finally, many free online mapping tools provide census data, making
it possible to explore mapping concepts without rigorous technical training.

2.4.1 Background to the Census
The United States census is conducted every ten years with the goal of counting every person in the
country, although, as described below, it is almost impossible to reach this goal. The census collects
information about the race, age, and housing situation of the population. The primary purpose of the
census, as established in the Constitution, is to determine the number of seats each state will have
in the US House of Representatives, the legislative branch of government. Voting district boundaries
must then be redrawn in states that have gained or lost seats between census years (we will take a
closer look at how redistricting is done and the spatial challenges of the process in later chapters).
Censuses also determine how hundreds of billions of dollars in federal funding are distributed for
many important purposes, including education, health care, environmental protection, transportation,
and other forms of federal aid to states and cities.
The first US census, carried out in 1791 by sixteen US marshals and 650 assistants, counted around
3.9 million people. They asked only a few questions: the number of free persons, the number of
slaves, and the sex and race of each individual.

2. Data 33

Census form 1791. This form for the first census in the United States was filled out by a census taker who asked a few
questions. 11

By 1960, with the population approaching 180 million, it was no longer feasible to have a census
taker visit each household. Instead, questionnaires were mailed to every household, and temporary
employees followed up in person with the households that did not respond.

34 Mapping, Society, and Technology

Census form 1960. This is a blank copy of the 1960 Census form that was mailed to each household to be filled out. 12

Questions asked of all households now include the number of persons by age, gender, ethnicity,
homeownership, and household composition. Between 1940 and 2000, one in six households also
received a more detailed “long form” survey which asked questions about a much wider range of
topics including income, occupation, commute length, and military service. The Census Bureau then
used this sample to estimate the characteristics of the rest of the population.
Demand for more timely social data led to the development of the American Community Survey
(ACS), which replaced the long form census survey in 2010. The ACS is conducted every year in
order to provide more frequent “snapshots” of demographic, economic, and housing characteristics
of the population. However, only 2-3 million households receive the survey per year (less than 2% of
the population), which introduces substantial statistical errors in estimates for the whole population.
Data for the census and ACS are collected from each household, but in order to preserve privacy and
to make the data easier to use, the Census Bureau aggregates the data to larger geographic areas.
While data are available for a large number of different geographical areas, we will work primarily
with census tracts and counties in this course. Census tracts have a population size between 1,200
and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. Census tract boundaries generally follow
environmental or political features, but the spatial size of census tracts can vary a great deal

2. Data 35

depending on the density of settlement and population. Census tract boundaries and shapes are drawn
with the goal that they will stay pretty much the same over a long time so that statistical comparisons
can be made from census to census.

2.4.2 Limitations of Census Data
The census is the most comprehensive source of demographic information available for the United
States, but it still has important limitations.
The primary challenge is accuracy and undercounting. The census attempts to take a snapshot of
how many people there are and where they are living on April 1st of the census year. The method
for collecting data assumes that every person lives in a housing unit with a postal address and that
they will respond accurately to surveys. The Census Bureau estimated that approximately 10 million
people were missed in its 2010 count.

Census 2010. The first enumeration of the 2010 Census took place in Noorvik, Alaska. An early start allows census
takers to reach remote villages before residents leave to hunt and fish or travel for warm-weather jobs following the
spring thaw. 13

Undercounting is not random because it is more prevalent in certain areas and subpopulations. Those

36 Mapping, Society, and Technology

who are homeless or have unstable housing at the time of the census are often missed. Those residing
in remote rural areas can be hard to contact by mail or in person. The census is also less likely to
receive responses from those who distrust the government, such as people fearful that their answers
will be used by immigration enforcement to deport undocumented family members.
Because the census is only taken every ten years, the counts have long-term consequences for states
and cities. The accuracy of counts can be very contentious in cash-strapped cities. For example,
Detroit challenged the findings of the 2010 census, having come up 40,000 people short of a
population cutoff point for many major sources of federal funding. Since poor and marginalized
populations are among the hardest to count, districts with the most need are also the most at risk of
underfunding and underrepresentation.
Beyond accuracy issues, while the census and ACS provide an extensive set of social data, plenty
of topics are not covered. For example, there are no questions about religion, consumer spending,
or political party affiliation. The quantity and wording of questions asked in the census has changed
over time, and data are not always available for all places or for all geographic areas.
Remember that there are many other social surveys which collect information about different
attributes, areas, or periods. For example, the Association of Statisticians of American Religious
Bodies conducts the “Religious Congregations and Membership Study” (RCMS) every 10 years to
track patterns of religious affiliation. Local governments gather data for projects in their specific
region. There are also censuses conducted in countries around the world with varying levels of detail
and accuracy.

2.5 Data Concepts & Problems
When choosing data to analyze a specific problem, there are some key concepts to bear in mind: 1)
resolution, 2) accuracy, and 3) interoperability. We will look at each of these concepts with respect
to the three elements of spatial data (location, attributes, time). Each of these concepts can be rolled
in under the term metadata in that they are information about data (or data about data). Developing
and understanding metadata involve looking past the basics of ‘data’ in terms of spatial location,
attributes measured, and time collected.

2.5.1 Resolution
Resolution describes the breadth or specificity of the data you are examining. There are three main
types of resolution – spatial, attribute, and temporal. Higher resolution corresponds with smaller
areas over which data are aggregated, narrower distinctions between categories, or shorter times

2. Data 37

between data collection. But before we get into examples of resolution related to mapping social data,
think about the concept in relation to everyday technology.
Spatial Resolution. You have probably seen the term “resolution” used to describe the quality of
a computer screen or mobile phone camera. Each picture is composed of many smaller squares or
pixels. When the pixels that make up the larger picture are small, more detail can be distinguished
and the image is said to have higher resolution. As the size of the square pixels increases, it becomes
more difficult to make out small details, such as the water droplets on the flower petals. This can
be important if you copy an image from a website and then resize the image. Depending on the
resolution of the original picture, you may suddenly be able to see pixels that previously were too
small to see.

38 Mapping, Society, and Technology

Spatial resolution. Comparing higher resolution and lower resolution in a photograph of leaves (top) or in a grid
(bottom). 14

Spatial resolution can also refer to the question, “What is the smallest unit of area measured?” It is
similar to pixel resolution, except that the map often is not split into equally sized squares. Instead,
the map might be split up between administrative boundaries (such as census tracts, counties, or
states) which have varying shapes and land areas. The greater the area over which data have been
aggregated, the lower the resolution and the more difficult it is to make out small details in the
data. In the figure below, small areas of high population density are not visible with lower spatial
resolution.

Census data resolution. Comparing population density data aggregated by county (left) to data aggregated by census
tract (right). 15

Consider an example. If you were trying to determine whether there had been increasing median
income on your block in the last 4 years, but the only data you could find was zip code level
resolution, it would be hard to establish the pattern. Zip codes are substantially larger than blocks.
Changes of median income in other parts of the zip code might obscure or falsely enhance what is
happening on your block.
Attribution resolution deals with the degree to which distinctions are made between categories. Data
split into many categories provide more detailed distinctions and therefore higher attribute resolution.
For example, imagine you are interested in data about the age of individuals. If the data are grouped
into only two categories – individuals who are under 18 years old and individuals who are over 18
years old – the data would have low attribute resolution. By comparison, splitting ages into more
categories (e.g., 0-18, 18-34, 34-64, 65+) would give us higher attribution resolution. If you need to
know the number of individuals who are old enough to vote in national elections, using the lower

2. Data 39

resolution data would be sufficient. But if you are interested in the number of senior citizens, you
would need to have higher data resolution.
Temporal resolution is the frequency with which data are collected, and in essence addresses the
question, How often or over what period of time is a measurement taken? In the section above, we
noted that the US Census Bureau collects data every ten years, whereas the ACS conducts a survey
every year. The census is more accurate than the ACS because it draws on a larger proportion of the
population, but at the cost of having a coarser temporal resolution. It would not be possible to make
an argument about how your neighborhood had changed demographically over a period of five years
given the temporal resolution of the census, because the census will only give you a snapshot of your
neighborhood every ten years.
In summary, when looking at data, ask yourself the following questions: Are you looking at the
correct area for the question being asked? Are the categories in the data specific enough for your
argument (or do you need to broaden your claims)? Are data collected frequently enough for the time
period you want to analyze?

2.5.2 Accuracy
Accuracy describes how well data on a map align with objects in the world. There are three main
types of accuracy – spatial, attribute, and temporal.
Spatial accuracy answers the question of how well an object’s location on the map matches its
location in the world. There are many reasons why the locations of something on a map do not
exactly correspond to those on the ground in reality. Boundaries between countries may be drawn
incorrectly. Points marked using GPS can be offset from their actual location if the signal is blocked
by trees or tall buildings. The figure below shows the example of a person whose movements are
being tracked with GPS in a vehicle. The map appears to show the person walking through several
buildings and then running across a nine-lane freeway. It only appears that way on the maps because
of an error in how the GPS measurements were collected.

40 Mapping, Society, and Technology

Spatial accuracy. Blue dots mark the path taken by an individual carrying a GPS tracking device in a vehicle. 16

Attribute accuracy asks whether characteristics reported about an object are true about that object
in the world. Attribute inaccuracies can show up in survey data if participants do not respond,
misunderstand the instructions, or purposefully provide false information. Inaccuracies may also
occur when estimating values for a small area based on a small number of responses. Remember
that the ACS polls around 2% of the population each year – 4 out of every 200 people – and then
estimates the characteristics of the rest of the population from their responses. The ACS has better
attribute and temporal resolution than the census (more categories that are collected more often), but
the census is more accurate in the sense that it counts more people.
Temporal accuracy is concerned with whether details about an object are up-to-date with respect to
changes in the world. While data may be accurate and complete at the time they are collected, details
may soon be inaccurate because of changes to the social and physical landscape. For example, the
objects on a printed reference map will become less accurate over time as new roads are constructed,
removed, or given name changes.

2. Data 41

Temporal accuracy. Static road maps are updated much less frequently than Google maps. 17

2.5.3 Interoperability
Interoperability describes how well two different datasets work with each other. There are three main
types of interoperability – spatial, attribute, and temporal.
Ask yourself the following questions: Are they comparing the same area? Do they use the same
categories and define them in the same way? These questions are especially relevant when using data
collected by different organizations or across multiple time periods.
Spatial interoperability. How well do spatial units match up? This is the question that concerns
spatial interoperability. For example, zip codes and census tracts are spatial units for which data
are frequently aggregated, but their boundaries are rarely the same. A census tract may fall within
multiple zip codes and vice versa. Zip code level data and census tract level data have poor
interoperability because they do not show characteristics for the same group of people.

42 Mapping, Society, and Technology

Census Geographies. Census Geographies. Geographic areas for which the US Census Bureau makes data available,
ranging from the state level down to blocks. 18

Attribute interoperability asks the question: how well do the categories of two datasets match? For
example, in the 2010 census, individuals could pick from between fifteen different racial categories
with the option of selecting multiple categories. By comparison, in the 1850 census individuals were
divided into only three racial categories: “white,” “black,” or “mulatto.” These two datasets have
poor attribute interoperability because they have very different attribute resolution and do not have
matching categories.

2. Data 43

Census form 2010 on race. In the 2010 Census, individuals could pick from between fifteen different racial categories
with the option of selecting multiple categories. 19

Even a category that has a similar name between two census years may measure different attributes.
The category “Chinese” used in the 1870 census was applied to individuals from any part of Asia,
rather than just China. It is therefore not interoperable with “Chinese” as used in the 2010 census.
Temporal interoperability. How well do reported times match up? Temporal interoperability is of
most concern if you are making an argument about what things are like at one point in time but your
data are not from the same point in time. For example, imagine you are working at a nonprofit that
is trying to compare the number of children ages 0-5 to the number and location of early childhood
centers in an area. The most accurate count of children is from the 2010 census, but your organization
has information about childhood centers collected in 2015. These two datasets have poor temporal
interoperability because no children who were 0-5 at the time of the census would still be in that
age bracket in 2015. It would be hard to determine whether childhood centers are appropriately
located based on this data. Per below, sometimes you have to worry about both spatial and temporal
interoperability!

44 Mapping, Society, and Technology

Spatial and temporal interoperability. Boundaries for different census years in South Africa do not align between years
because new regions were added over time. One solution is to create a new map that groups together regions; this
integrated geography allows data to be compared between maps. 20

In summary, when looking at multiple sets of data, ask yourself: Does it make sense to compare
these data? Are the data generated for the same area using the same spatial units? Are the attribute
categories defined the same way by the organization(s) that produced the data and over time? Were
the data produced over a comparable time frame?

2.6 Mapping Tools
There are many software programs for making maps and most offer a range of data to their users.

2. Data 45

While these programs have traditionally been developed for desktop computers, a large and growing
number of websites and web applications are allowing people to view and make maps online. These
maps and tools have been developed with the goal of making data more accessible to researchers,
politicians, and members of the public.
Social Explorer is an example of an online mapping tool, developed to make it easier to access and
use data generated by the US Census Bureau. Keep in mind that many organizations are focused
on getting maps online and had no role in collecting the underlying data. Instead, online maps and
mapping tools act like libraries by bringing together information from multiple sources. Note that
Social Explorer is not the source of the data being mapped; it is our tool for exploring data created
by the Census Bureau.

2.7 Conclusion
Whenever you look at a map, it is important to think about how the data that has been visualized were
generated. Who created the map? How were the underlying data collected? What questions were
asked of whom? How accurate is the map? What is missing? Even the most carefully created data
contain errors and have a context within a social, political, and cultural landscape. To be a responsible
map user and map maker, you must think about what you can and cannot show given the resolution,
accuracy, and interoperability of the available data. It is important to cite the sources of the data you
include on your map so that your audience can find additional information.
As we move on to explore how to symbolize and simplify data, to make an appealing map, and to
analyze the spatial relationships of data, remember: a map can only be as good as the data that go
into it.

3. Scale and Projections
Laura Matson and Melinda Kernik

Scale and projections are two fundamental features of maps that usually do not get the attention they
deserve. Scale refers to how map units relate to real-world units. Projections deal with the methods
and challenges around turning a three-dimensional (and sort of lumpy) earth into a two-dimensional
map.
This chapter will introduce you to:
• Scale and ways of telling the map user what the map is measuring on the ground
• Projection mechanics, types of projections, and their characteristics
By the end of this chapter, you should be able to read map scales and identify common projections
along with their basic features and uses.

3.1 Scale
The world is vast. The earth’s surface has an area of over 500 million km2 and any picture of the
earth that you can easily carry can only show general outlines of continents and countries. When we
visually represent a region of the world on a map, we must reduce its size to fit within the boundaries
of the map. Map scale measures how much the features of the world are reduced to fit on a map; or
more precisely, map scale shows the proportion of a given distance on a map to the corresponding
distance on the ground in the real world.
Map scale is represented by a representative fraction, graphic scale, or verbal description.

50 Mapping, Society, and Technology

Map scales. A map can have a representative fraction, graphic scale, or verbal description that all mean the same thing. 1

Representative fraction. The most commonly used measure of map scale is the representative fraction
(RF), where map scale is shown as a ratio. With the numerator always set to 1, the denominator
represents how much greater the distance is in the world. The figure below shows a topographic map
with an RF of 1:24,000, which means that one unit on the map represents 24,000 units on the ground.
The representative fraction is accurate regardless of which units are used; the RF can be measured as
1 centimeter to 24,000 centimeters, one inch to 24,000 inches, or any other unit.

Representative fraction. Representative fraction and scale bars from a United States Geological Survey (USGS)
topographic map. This topographic map has an RF of 1:24,000, which means that one unit on the map represents 24,000
units on the ground. 2

3. Scale and Projections 51

Graphic scale. Scale bars are graphical representations of distance on a map. The figure has scale
bars for 1 mile, 7000 feet, and 1 kilometer. One important advantage of graphic scales is that they
remain true when maps are shrunk or magnified.
Verbal description. Some maps, especially older ones, use a verbal description of scale. For example,
it is common to see “one inch represents one kilometer” or something similar written on a map to
give map users an idea of the scale of the map.
Map makers use scale to describe maps as being small-scale or large-scale. This description of
map scale as large or small can seem counter-intuitive at first. A 3-meter by 5-meter map of the
United States has a small map scale while a UMN campus map of the same size is large-scale.
Scale descriptions using the RF provide one way of considering scale, since 1:1000 is larger than
1:1,000,000. Put differently, if we were to change the scale of the map with an RF of 1:100,000 so
that a section of road was reduced from one unit to, say, 0.1 units in length, we would have created a
smaller-scale map whose representative fraction is 1:1,000,000.
When we talk about large- and small-scale maps and geographic data, then, we are talking about the
relative sizes and levels of detail of the features represented in the data. In general, the larger the map
scale, the more detail that is shown.

3.2 Extent vs. Resolution
The extent of a map describes the area visible on the map, while resolution describes the smallest
unit that is mapped. You can think of extent as describing the region to which the map is zoomed.
The extent of the map below is national as it encompasses the contiguous United States, while the
resolution is the state, because states are the finest level of spatial detail that we can see.

52 Mapping, Society, and Technology

Map resolution and extent. This map shows a national extent and a state resolution. The extent of the map is national
while the resolution is at the state level because they are the finest level of spatial detail that we can see. 3

We often choose mapping resolutions intentionally to make the map easier to understand. For
example, if we tried to display a map with a national extent at the resolution of census blocks, the
level of detail would be so fine and the boundaries would be so small that it would be difficult
to understand anything about the map. Balancing extent and resolution is often one of the most
important and difficult decisions a cartographer must make. The figure below offers two more
examples of the difference between extent and resolution.

3. Scale and Projections 53

More map extent and resolution. Maps showing an extent of the Pacific Northwest. The top image has a spatial
resolution of county and the bottom has a spatial resolution of census tracts. 4

3.3 Coordinates & Projections
Locations on the earth’s surface are measured in terms of coordinates, a set of two or more numbers
that specifies a location in relation to some reference system. The simplest system of this kind is
a Cartesian coordinate system, named for the 17th century mathematician and philosopher René
Descartes. A Cartesian coordinate system, like the one below, is simply a grid formed by putting
together two measurement scales, one horizontal (x) and one vertical (y). The point at which both x
and y equal zero is called the origin of the coordinate system. In the figure, the origin (0,0) is located
at the center of the grid (the intersection of the two bold lines). All other positions are specified
relative to the origin, as seen with the points at (3, 2) and (-4, -1)

54 Mapping, Society, and Technology

Coordinate system. Locations on the Earth’s surface are measured in terms of coordinates, a set of two or more numbers
that specifies a location in relation to some reference system. 5

The geographic coordinate system is designed specifically to define positions on the Earth’s roughlyspherical surface. Instead of the two linear measurement scales x and y, as with a Cartesian grid,
the geographic coordinate system uses an east-west scale, called longitude that ranges from +180° to
-180°. Because the Earth is round, +180° (or 180° E) and -180° (or 180° W) are the same grid line,
termed the International Date Line. Opposite the International Date Line is the prime meridian, the
line of longitude defined as 0°. The north-south scale, called latitude, ranges from +90° (or 90° N) at
the North pole to -90° (or 90° S) at the South pole. In simple terms, longitude specifies positions east
and west and latitude specifies positions north and south. At higher latitudes, the length of parallels
decreases to zero at 90° North and South. Lines of longitude are not parallel, but converge toward the
poles. Thus, while a degree of longitude at the equator is equal to a distance of about 111 kilometers,
that distance decreases to zero at the poles.

3. Scale and Projections 55

Longitude and latitude. The graticule is based on an east-west scale called longitude and a north-south scale called
latitude. 6

The graticule specifies positions on the globe with latitude and longitude coordinates. The graticule
refers to longitude and latitude on a three-dimensional globe. When we use longitude and latitude on
a two-dimensional map, we refer to these as geographic coordinates. Maps can have an enormous
array of different coordinate systems depending on who developed and used them.
Projection is the term for turning a three-dimensional globe into a two-dimensional map. As noted
above, the graticule on a globe is helpful, but how do we go from three-dimensional graticule to twodimensional geographic coordinates, as per the figure below? We will discuss the process of how
objects on a 3-dimensional surface (the earth) come to be represented on a flat piece of paper or
computer screen. Our emphasis will be on the properties that different projections distort or maintain
– area, shape, and distance.

56 Mapping, Society, and Technology

Graticule projected. The longitude and latitude of the graticule become two-dimensional geographic coordinates through
projection. 7

Projection is the process of making a two-dimensional map from a three-dimensional globe. We can
think of the earth as a sphere. In reality, it is more of an ellipsoid with a few bulges, but it is fine to
think of it as a sphere. To get a sense of how difficult this process can be, imagine peeling the skin
from an orange and trying to lay the skin flat.

Flattened orange peel. You can imagine the difficulty of moving from a 3d to 2d surface by considering how difficult it
is to peel the rind from an orange and try to lay the skin flat. 8

As you peel and flatten the skin, you will encounter several problems:
• Shearing – stretching the skin in one or more directions

3. Scale and Projections 57

• Tearing – causing the skin to separate
• Compressing – forcing the skin to bunch up and condense
Cartographers face the same three issues when they try to transform the three-dimensional globe
into a two-dimensional map. If you had a globe made of paper, you could carefully try to ‘peel’ it
into a flat piece of paper, but you would have a big mess on your hands. Instead, cartographers use
projections to create useable two-dimensional maps.

Shearing, tearing, compression. Cartographers face these the three issues of shearing, tearing, and compression on a
globe when they try to transform the three-dimensional globe into a two dimensional map. 9

58 Mapping, Society, and Technology

3.4 Projection Mechanics
The term “map projection” refers to both the process and product of transforming spatial coordinates
on a three-dimensional sphere to a two-dimensional plane. In terms of actual mechanics, most
projections use mathematical functions that take as inputs locations on the sphere and translate them
into locations on a two-dimensional surface.
It is helpful to think about projections in physical terms. If you had a clear globe the size of a beach
ball and placed a light inside this globe, it would cast shadows onto a surrounding surface. If this
surface were a piece of paper that you wrapped around the globe, you could carefully trace these
shadows onto the paper, then flatten out this piece of paper and have your projection!

Thinking of projections in physical terms. You can conceptualize projection as working with a clear globe, a light bulb,
and tracing paper. If you had a clear globe the size of a beach ball and placed a light inside this globe, it would cast
shadows onto a surrounding surface. This surface can be a (a) cylinder, (b) cone, or (c) plane. 10

Most projections transform part of the globe to one of three “developable” surfaces, so called because
they are flat or can be made flat: plane, cone, and cylinder. The resultant projections are called planar,

3. Scale and Projections 59

conical, and cylindrical. We use developable surfaces because they eliminate tearing, although they
will produce shearing and compression. Of these three problems, tearing is seen as the worst because
you would be making maps with all sorts of holes in them! As we see below, however, there are times
when you can create maps with tearing and they are quite useful.
The place where the developable surface touches the globe is known as the tangent point or tangent
line. Maps will most accurately represent objects on the globe at these tangent points or lines, with
distortion increasing as you move farther away due to shearing and compression. It is for this reason
that cylinders are often used for areas near the equator, cones used to map the mid-latitudes, and
planes used for polar regions.

Tangency. Red lines or dots mark the tangent line or point respectively. The flat surface touches the globe and it is the
point on the projected map which has the least distortion. the place where the developable surface touches the globe is
known as the tangent point or tangent line. These surfaces can be a (a) cylinder, (b) cone, or (c) plane. 11

For beginning mapmakers, understanding the exact mechanics of projections doesn’t matter as much
as knowing which map properties are maintained or lost with the choice of projection – the topic of
the next section.
Projections must distort features on the surface of the globe during the process of making them flat

60 Mapping, Society, and Technology

because projection involves shearing, tearing, and compression. Since no projection can preserve
all properties, it is up to the map maker to know which properties are most important for their
purpose and to choose an appropriate projection. The properties we will focus on are: shape, area,
and distance.
Note that distortion is not necessarily tied to the type of developable surface but rather to the way
the transformation is done with that surface. It is possible to preserve any one of the three properties
using any of the developable surfaces. One way of looking at the problem is with distortion ellipses.
These help us to visualize what type of distortion a map projection has caused, how much distortion
has occurred, and where it has occurred. The ellipses show how imaginary circles on the globe are
deformed as a result of a particular projection. If no distortion had occurred in projecting a map, all
of the ellipses would be the same size and circular in shape.

3.4.1 Conformal
Conformal projections preserve shape and angle, but strongly distort area in the process. For
example, with the Mercator projection, the shapes of coastlines are accurate on all parts of the map,
but countries near the poles appear much larger relative to countries near the equator than they
actually are. For example, Greenland is only 7-percent the land area of Africa, but it appears to be
just as large!

3. Scale and Projections 61

Mercator projection. The Mercator projection is conformal because it preserves shape and angle but strongly distorts
area. 12

Conformal projections should be used if the main purpose of the map involves measuring angles or
representing the shapes of features. They are very useful for navigation, topography (elevation), and
weather maps.

62 Mapping, Society, and Technology

Mercator projection. One of the first maps of the world developed was by Mercator (Carta do Mundo de Mercator,
1569). 13

A conformal projection will have distortion ellipses that vary substantially in size, but are all the
same circular shape. The consistent shapes indicate that conformal projections (like this Mercator
projection of the world) preserve shapes and angles. This useful property accounts for the fact that
conformal projections are almost always used as the basis for large scale surveying and mapping.

3. Scale and Projections 63

Mercator distortion. The Mercator projection is conformal because it preserves shape and angle but strongly distorts
area. 14

3.4.2 Equal Area
On equal-area projections, the size of any area on the map is in true proportion to its size on the
earth. In other words, countries’ shapes may appear to be squished or stretched compared to what
they look like on a globe, but their land area will be accurate relative to other land masses. For
example, in the Gall-Peters projection, the shape of Greenland is significantly altered, but the size
of its area is correct in comparison to Africa. This type of projection is important for quantitative
thematic data, especially in mapping density (an attribute over an area). For example, it would be
useful in comparing the density of Syrian refugees in the Middle East or the amount of cropland in
production.

64 Mapping, Society, and Technology

Gall-Peters projection. The Gall Peters projection is equal area. Note how the shape of Greenland is significantly altered,
but the size of its area is correct in comparison to other regions such as Africa. 15

As we can see with an equal-area projection, however, the ellipses maintain the correct proportions in
the sizes of areas on the globe but that their shapes are distorted. Equal-area projections are preferred
for small-scale thematic mapping, especially when map users are expected to compare sizes of area
features like countries and continents.

3. Scale and Projections 65

Gall-Peters distortion. The Gall Peters projection is equal area. Note how the shape of Greenland is significantly altered,
but the size of its area is correct in comparison to other regions such as Africa. 16

3.4.3 Equidistant
Equidistant projections, as the name suggests, preserve distance. This is a bit misleading because no
projection can maintain relative distance between all places on the map. Equidistant maps are able,
however, to preserve distances along a few clearly specified lines. For example, on the Azimuthal
Equidistant projection, all points are the proportionally correct distance and direction from the center
point. This type of projection would be useful visualizing airplane flight paths from one city to
several other cities or in mapping an earthquake epicenter. Azimuthal projections preserve distance
at the cost of distorting shape and area to some extent. The flag of the United Nations contains an
example of a polar azimuthal equidistant projection.

66 Mapping, Society, and Technology

Azimuthal Equidistant projection. In this equidistant projection, all points are the proportionally correct distance and
direction from the center point. This projection is used on the map of the United Nations. 17

3.4.4 Compromise, Interrupted, and Artistic Projections
Some projections, including the Robinson projection, strike a balance between the different map
properties. In other words, instead of preserving shape, area, or distance, they try to avoid extreme
distortion of any of these properties. This type of projection would be useful for a general purpose
world map.

3. Scale and Projections 67

Robinson Projection. Some projections, including the Robinson projection, strike a balance between the different map
properties. In other words, they do not preserve shape, area, or distance, but instead try to avoid extreme distortion. 18

Compromise projections preserve no one properties, but instead seek a compromise that minimizes
distortion of all kinds, as with the Robinson projection, which is often used for small-scale thematic
maps of the world.

Compromise distortion. Note that some maps may not preserve either shape or area but do a pretty good job at both. 19

Other projections deal with the challenge of making the 3D globe flat by tearing the earth in strategic

68 Mapping, Society, and Technology

places. Interrupted projections such as the interrupted Goode Homolosine projection represent the
earth in lobes, reducing the amount of shape and area distortion near the poles. The projection was
developed in 1923 by John Paul Goode to provide an alternative to the Mercator projection for
portraying global areal relationships.

Goode homolosine projection of the world. This equal-area projection is interrupted in the sense that it uses lobes or
sections. 20

The Interrupted Goode Homolosine preserves area (so it is equal-area or equivalent) but does not
preserve shape (it is not conformal).

Interrupted distortion. This equal area projection preserves area but distorts shape, but not as much as it would if it were
not interrupted. 21

There are also many projections that are aesthetically pleasing, but not intended for navigation

3. Scale and Projections 69

between places or to visualize data. Examples of these artistic projections include the heart-shaped
Stabius-Werner projection.

Artistic projections. Many projections are interesting and beautiful, like this Stabius-Werner Projection, but are not
intended for navigation between places or to visualize data. 22

3.5 Conclusion
In this chapter, we have explored the concepts of scale, resolution, and projection. There are hundreds
of projections, each which distorts the world in a slightly different way. Keep in mind that all maps
have a scale and there are a few important ways to indicate this scale. All maps also use a projection
that can be formed from a developable surface and can preserve one or two properties at most.

4. Design and Symbolization
Eric Deluca and Dudley Bonsal

“Design is so simple, that’s why it is so complicated.” Paul Rand, graphic designer
The difference between an ordinary map and one that is persuasive and interesting depends on how
well the cartographer incorporates principles of good design and symbolization. Data, in isolation,
cannot tell a story. It is up to the cartographer to make the data convincing by turning mundane
information into artistic expressions. The concepts in this chapter are fairly basic to understand, yet
they take years to put to good practice. Map design requires patience, trial and error, and careful
attention to detail.
This chapter will introduce you to:
• Basic map elements: key elements, such as a title or source, are found on most maps and
understanding their purpose will give you a solid foundation for cartography.
• Design principles: there are many principles of good design, but we start with the two of
hierarchy and balance, which make the difference between boring maps and maps that
pop out at the reader.
• Symbolization: cartographers have many tools to make data more memorable and
convincing, and among these are symbolization basics including geometry and visual
variables.
By the end of this chapter, you should understand basic principles of design and symbolization, and
tools you can use to make interesting, aesthetically pleasing, and effective maps.

4.1 Map Elements
Maps are composed of a varying number of elements. There are potentially dozens of map elements
but we focus here on a few key ones.
• Figure. The thing or place being mapped is called the figure of the map. In the map below,
the figure of the map is the continental United States.
• Ground. The figure is juxtaposed against the ground of the map, or in other words, the
background. In this case, it is the countries outside of the United States and the oceans.

74 Mapping, Society, and Technology

• Frame. Maps often have frame, a line drawn around the figure and ground, that acts like a
picture frame does for a picture. The more technical term neatline is also used.

Map elements. Key map elements include figure, ground, and frame. Additional elements that make for a basic map are
title, legend, credits, and scale. 1

Other elements are informative enough to be used almost always, including a title, scale, legend, and
source information.
• Title. The title is a short, descriptive text typically at or near the top of the map. A good
title should provide some detail about the map’s content without being too wordy or
descriptive. Map titles often include all or some of the following components: the subject
of the map, the year, the spatial extent, the mapping resolution, and the data source.
• Legend. The legend lists the symbols used and explains what is being mapped. It is
important to include the symbols on the legend exactly as they appear on the map.
Legends include both text and graphics, and they sometimes contain additional details
such as the source of the data or the year the data were collected. Labeling the units in the
legend is important so the audience can properly understand the data being mapped. If
your map of counties shows the number of bicycles per thousand people, then the legend
should say so.

4. Design and Symbolization 75

• Source/Credits. Think back to the data chapter and recall how important it is to know
where the mapping data come from and what sort of biases are inherent in the data. For
transparency purposes, it is necessary to provide attribution to the source of the data— the
place, company, person or agency that made the data. These are also known more
generally as credits. Including the source makes it possible for the audience to explore the
data further if necessary. Knowing who made the map can help the reader better gauge the
accuracy and reliability of the data. Sometimes, the mapmaker is highly regarded for
accurate and unbiased use of data; other times, he or she is known for having a political
agenda that would raise doubts about data accuracy. Source attribution can be as simple as
a short text annotation near the bottom of the map, or it can include more detailed
information.
• Scale. Almost all maps include a scale because maps are smaller than the reality being
mapped. Providing the map audience with information about what scale you are using is
important so they can have some understanding of relative size and distance. The scale is
often provided in a less prominent part of the map and is typically displayed with graphics
or text. There are times when the scale is so obvious that it is omitted from a map. For
example, a map of the entire world does not typically have a scale bar on it, because
everyone has a general understanding of how large the world is. Keep in mind from the
section on projections, however, that many maps distort area, so the sizes that you see on
a map might not always be spatially accurate. In this case, listing the projection with the
scale is helpful.
There are many other possible elements that cartographers may include and that you may see used
in maps. These other elements, while not as frequently included, often represent good mapmaking
practice, especially if you want the reader to understand how the map was created. These elements
include the cartographer’s name or company, the production date, and the projection. Some elements
of the map, such as the north arrow, follow conventions, or commonly understood rules. Typically,
we equate the orientation “up” with “north,” so cartographers will often omit the north arrow on a
map unless the map breaks that convention.

4.2 Design Principles
While a title, legend, source, and scale are necessary elements of all maps, they need be applied
according to map design principles in order to properly convey the information. Poorly designed
maps, like the one below, can be both difficult to read and confusing.

76 Mapping, Society, and Technology

Poor map design. While the bottom map contains necessary elements (such as title, legend, scale, and source), it fails to
practice principles of good design. It is unbalanced, disorganized, and uses white space poorly. 2

Designing maps to be visually appealing is an art form, and there are entire courses in cartography
devoted to these principles. Two of the foundational elements of design that all good maps must
incorporate are hierarchy and balance.

4.2.1 Hierarchy
Not all information on a map is of equal importance. A title is more important than the north
arrow, so making them the same size would lead to inadequate emphasis on the title. It also does

4. Design and Symbolization 77

not make sense if a legend is so large that it overwhelms the actual figure that you are mapping.
Visual hierarchy is the design principle that takes these factors into consideration. A map with good
hierarchy emphasizes important information and figures by positioning them strategically on the
map and by using visual variables appropriately. Typically, the top of the map is a good place for
important information like the title. Size and color are two other important tools in creating strong
visual hierarchy, as the more important text and figures can be larger in size.

Visual hierarchy. Typically, the top left of the map is a good place for important information like the title. If this frame
represents the layout of a map, it is often helpful to put your most important information on the top or the top left side of
the page. Information near the bottom of the page seems less important to the map audience. Bear in mind that the “topleft to bottom-right” rule is relevant in the western context, but different cultures have different rules of visual emphasis
so it is important to understand the audience of your map. 3

78 Mapping, Society, and Technology

Visual hierarchy examples. These three maps use various techniques of visual hierarchy. None of them are necessarily
“correct,” but you can see how certain techniques help to emphasize the important features. Note how these images use
hues, sizes of lines, and texture in different ways to emphasize certain roads and parks. 4

4.2.2 Balance
Not everything that is important can be in large text at the top of the map. After you satisfy
requirements of visual hierarchy, the next step is to make sure that your map looks balanced. This
entails aligning text with other text or elements so everything looks neat and organized. If your map

4. Design and Symbolization 79

is too cluttered it will be difficult to see the information, so maintaining a sufficient amount of white
space is helpful.

Hierarchy and balance. These are three examples of incorporating hierarchy and balance to varying degrees of
effectiveness. The map on the top offers good hierarchy and balance as the image is well sized, and there is sufficient
white space. The map in the middle does not leave enough room for the legend and title. The map on the bottom has too
much white space so it is difficult to make out the figure. 5

80 Mapping, Society, and Technology

4.3 Symbolization
Symbolization is the term used to describe how the features on a map are visualized. Unless you
are looking at an aerial photographic image, everything on a map is a symbol for something in the
real world. A mapmaker must constantly decide how a map feature should be symbolized in a way
that helps the reader to quickly understand what it represents and its degree of importance relative to
other features in the map.
Before we continue, we need to consider a basic distinction between kinds of data, namely whether
they are quantitative or qualitative.
• Qualitative data deal with descriptions of a real-world phenomenon that relate to the
quality (which is where ‘qualitative’ comes from), or in other words, differences in kind
or existence.
• Quantitative data are those that deal in measurements (or quantities, which gives us the
term ‘quantitative’) that deal with differences in amount.
A qualitative map of cities, for example, would show whether a city exists or not in a given place,
while a quantitative map would show the location of the city as well as some measurement, such as
the number of people living there. A qualitative map of wildlife could indicate where different kinds
of animals live, while a quantitative map would show the amounts of different animals.
We look at two key components of symbolization: geometry and visual variables. Per the figure
below, these components all work together to make map symbolization.

Symbolization components. Basic building blocks of symbolization are geometry (points, lines, and areas) and visual
variables (shape, size, hue, and value).6

4. Design and Symbolization 81

4.3.1. Geometry
Most map symbols are essentially variations on three simple geometric features: the point, the line,
and the polygon.

Geometry. Points, lines, and areas and how they can be used interchangeably. Each row represents a different mode of
symbolization, and each column represents a different kind of real-life thing or place.7

Points are typically used for discrete features, such as a tree or the location of a store. Lines are often
used to represent roads, telephone lines, or other long, continuous features. Areas or polygons are
typically used to represent boundaries such as counties or parks, but they can also be used to help
generalize data such as the concentration of many individual animals. It is very common for all three
of these geometric objects to be used in a single map, such as the map of Montreal below which
contains the locations of roads (lines), cities (points), and parks (areas).

82 Mapping, Society, and Technology

Power of symbolization. Satellite Image on the left compared to a map incorporating point, line, and area symbolization
on the right.8

4.3.2 Visual Variables
We can modify the appearance of basic geometries of maps (points, lines, and polygons) in many
ways. The modifications or variation of these points, lines, and polygons are referred to as visual
variables because they describe how a given visual entity, like a line for example, varies from dark
to light or big to small. Visual variables are important in displaying both qualitative and quantitative
data. The four main visual variables that are commonly manipulated on maps are: shape, size, hue,
and value. The figure below highlights the main tenants of these visual variables as well as what
types of data they are best suited for.

Quantitative and qualitative data. Different visual variables are suited to quantitative data and qualitative data. 9

Shape. Shapes often indicate differences in kind, so they are good for qualitative data. There are
certain conventions of shape use, such as an airplane for an airport, or a cross for a hospital. Shapes
can also have much more specific representations. A wildlife map might show simple pictures of

4. Design and Symbolization 83

different species of animals to show the location of their habitats. Corporate logos can also be used,
indicating the locations of dealerships for different models like Honda or Ford, or someone looking
for a nearby fast food restaurant can easily distinguish between the locations of a McDonald’s or a
Burger King.

Qualitative data and shape. This map uses shapes to indicate different kinds of tree species. 10

Size. Size is a visual variable especially well-suited for quantitative attributes. Large sizes are often
understood to represent something of high value or importance, while small sizes represent low or
less important values. Size is limited by the ability of the map audience to estimate the difference
between sizes.

84 Mapping, Society, and Technology

Quantitative data and visual variables. This map uses one hue and incorporates changes in size to demonstrate quantity.
Cartographers sometimes like pictographic symbols because they can be more interesting (like the cars in the map at the
right), but the complicated shapes of these symbols may make their areas more difficult to estimate and create greater
problems with symbol overlap than more simple shapes like the circles in the map on the left. 11

Hue. When people speak about color on a map they usually refer to what is technically known as
hue. Hue is most commonly used to distinguish between qualitative data. Decisions are based on
psychological and social factors because we associate certain colors with certain real-world things:
blue (water), green (forest), and red (fire or heat). It is also common for red to be used to signify
intensity or importance while calming colors such as blue or grey help to signify something of less
intensity.

Hue. Different hues (colors) are used to demonstrate discrete qualitative data. 12

Value. Value refers to the lightness or darkness of a hue. It is most commonly used for quantitative
data as it can demonstrate relative importance or amount on a continuous scale. While the distinction
between light and dark is fairly obvious, be careful not to use too many different values on a map.
The human eye has difficulty distinguishing more than about eight values on a map.

4. Design and Symbolization 85

Value. Note the range of values across these 22 different shades of red. High value refers to a color that is very light,
while low value refers to colors that are dark. 13

4.3.3 Recap
In very general terms, we use size and value for quantitative data and we represent qualitative data
with hue and shape. This applies to points, lines, and areas, per this figure.

86 Mapping, Society, and Technology

Visual variables with quantitative and qualitative data. Different visual variables are suited for quantitative data and for
qualitative data. Cartographers tend to use size and value for quantitative data and represent qualitative data with hue
and shape. 14

Note that the kinds of data, qualitative or quantitative, makes a difference in color choice. Consider
the two maps below, which show internet users per 100 people by country. The first uses a single hue

4. Design and Symbolization 87

– purple – and different values. This first one is easier to understand because darker colors indicate
higher values. The second one uses different hues – such as green or red or orange – to indicate
different values. This one does not work as well because you have to study it intently to assess which
places are high and low in terms of internet users.

Mapping quantitative data. These two maps use hue and value differently, with an impact on map readability. 15

Symbolization choices may also be tied to the potential uses of your map. You may want to design
a map in color but your map users may want to reproduce it in black-and-white, as when a color
map gets photocopied on a black-and-white photocopier or printed on a monochrome printer. If you
know that your color map may become reproduced in black-and-white, you may choose to adjust

88 Mapping, Society, and Technology

your color design so that important features do not become lost in the translation. The figure below
explores these transitions for tree mapping.

Symbolization choices. In the top left map, different tree types are symbolized using different hues. If this map is
photocopied (top right), it will be very difficult to tell most classes of trees apart. However, by using shape and value
differences instead of hues (bottom map), the map reader can easily differentiate all five classes of trees. 16

4.4 Conclusion
In this chapter, we have looked at the basics of symbolization. Basic map elements include the figure,
ground, and frame as well as ones commonly seen on maps such as title, legend, scale, and source.
These elements are then integrated with design principles, particularly hierarchy and balance, and the
tools of symbolization, such as geometry and visual variables including shape, size, hue, and value.

5. Simplification
Melinda Kernik and Eric DeLuca

“What a useful thing a pocket-map is!” I remarked.
“That’s another thing we’ve learned from your Nation,” said Mein Herr,
“map-making. But we’ve carried it much further than you. What do you
consider the largest map that would be really useful?”
“About six inches to the mile.”
“Only six inches!” exclaimed Mein Herr. “We very soon got to six yards
to the mile. Then we tried a hundred yards to the mile. And then came the
grandest idea of all ! We actually made a map of the country, on the scale of
a mile to the mile!”
“Have you used it much?” I enquired.
“It has never been spread out, yet,” said Mein Herr: “the farmers objected:
they said it would cover the whole country, and shut out the sunlight ! So we
now use the country itself, as its own map, and I assure you it does nearly as
well.”
Lewis Carroll, Sylvie and Bruno Concluded, Chapter XI, London, 1895
Maps are by necessity smaller than what they portray in the real world. Because of this, only a limited
number of features can be represented on them. Choices have to be made about how to simplify the
complexity of the world to be understandable on the map. Knowing who your audience is and having
a clear sense of what you want to explain to them are crucial for deciding what to include and what to
leave out. For example, subway maps prioritize the names of stops and connections between subway
lines over the geographical location of the stops.

location of the stops. 1

Simplification is used in both thematic and reference maps. The first part of this chapter will look
at different kinds of thematic maps and the concept of classification, paying close attention to how
different classification schemes break up data between classes. We will also reflect on the ways in
which selecting a classification scheme and the number of classes impact the data patterns that are
visible. The second part of this chapter will look at how maps simplify the shape or number of objects
on a reference map – a process known as generalization.

5. Simplification 93

This chapter will introduce you to:
• the advantages and disadvantages of three common classification schemes
• situations in which data standardization is appropriate
• four major types of generalization on reference maps

5.1 Thematic Map Types
We use a variety of different kinds of maps. We will take a quick look at several key kinds and then
focus on a few in particular.
• Dot density maps use dots or points to show a comparative density of features over a base
map. The dots are all the same size.
• Proportional symbol maps use symbols that occur at points across a map, but unlike dot
maps, the symbol size varies based on the quantity or magnitude of the thing being
measured. Generally speaking, higher values get larger symbols.
• Choropleth maps are among the most commonly used thematic maps. They use varying
colors to show measures that are for areas or regions on the map.
• Cartograms distort the shape of areas to depict the magnitude of the attribute being
measured. A relatively high value within a typically small geographic unit like a state will
be depicted as disproportionately large on a cartogram because the size of the region is
based on its attributes and not its actual size.
• Flow maps show the movement of goods, people, and ideas between places. Usually they
depict the size of flows by changing the width of the lines connecting places.
• Density maps depict the concentration of point measures. You can think of this map
showing how each location spreads out its presence beyond its immediate location to
include adjacent areas.

94 Mapping, Society, and Technology

Map types. There are six common kinds of thematic maps that are used to simplify data. 2

5.1.1 Dot Map
On a dot map, each dot represents a fixed quantity. For one-to-one dot maps each dot represents one
object or person. For example, John Snow’s famous map had one dot for each reported death from
cholera around the Broad Street pump.

5. Simplification 95

One to one cholera map. John Snow’s famous one-to-one map of cholera deaths centered around the Broad Street
pump.3

Alternatively, one dot can stand in for multiple objects or people. The figure below shows an example
of a many-to-one map in which one dot represents 10,000 people.

96 Mapping, Society, and Technology

Many-to-one dot map. This map portrays the total population of the Northeastern United States. Each dot represents
10,000 people. 4

Dot maps are useful for quickly visualizing patterns of clustering and density. They do not require
color to communicate, which avoids issues arising from differences in how people perceive color
such as color blindness. Though they are versatile and intuitive, it can be hard to determine precise
numbers based on a dot map. One area may have more dots than another, but to know how many
more would require you to painstakingly count hundreds or thousands of dots.
Privacy can also be an issue for one-to-one maps. For example, you might not want exact locations
known when mapping sensitive subjects such as where patients with sexually transmitted diseases
live. To get around this, dots are often displaced from their actual location. By simplifying the
number of dots on the map, many-to-one maps avoid privacy problems, but instead face the challenge
of where to place the dots. Dots are generally positioned at an average location of the multiple objects
represented.

5. Simplification 97

Dot map simplification. The placement of dots in the middle of roads and unevenly distribution around the block are
evidence that the dots in the one-to-one dot map have been displaced. The many-to-one map of the same blocks
simplifies the amount of data shown and places dots at an average location. 5

Note that it is crucial that dot maps be drawn using an equal area projection, or the density of the dots
will be distorted.

5.1.2 Proportional Symbol Map
This type of map adjusts the size of simple symbols proportionally to the data value found at that
location. The larger the symbol, the “more” of something exists. Proportional symbols can be used to
represent data at precise locations (points) or data averaged over a geographic area. A key advantage
of this type of map is that perception of data value is not affected by the size of the area that the
symbol represents. In choropleth maps, states with small geographic areas (such as Rhode Island)
may be overlooked even if they have a large data value. By contrast, the sizes of symbols in a
proportional symbol map are not tied to the land area.
The downside to this is the greater likelihood of visual clutter. Symbols may overlap if locations with
large values are close together. As in the figure below, the relative sizes of symbols can matter. If you
choose symbols that are overall too small, it will be more difficult for the map reader to see patterns
in the data (top left) but if they are too large, many symbols will overlap and make it difficult to
see patterns in the data (top right). Ideally, the symbols have a slight overlap between symbols in

98 Mapping, Society, and Technology

the most crowded area of the map (bottom) without there being so much overlap that symbols are
hidden.

Symbol size. Proportional symbol map of motor vehicle deaths in California, United States. Note how the relative sizes
of symbols must be chosen with care. 6

This problem of overlap in proportional symbol maps can get to the point where people have trouble
accurately comparing symbol sizes, in the figure below. Many people underestimate differences in
symbol size, especially when the difference is large. The proportional symbol map maker must strike
a balance between having a range of symbol sizes and limiting their overlap.

5. Simplification 99

Proportional symbol map. With this map of population by county it is difficult to make out which county each symbol
represents in areas with many small populated counties. 7

5.1.3 Choropleth Map
On choropleth maps, areas are shaded using hue or value to represent different quantities. Usually
darker hues or values signify larger quantities. Choropleth maps are easy to make and to interpret,
which has made them very popular among map makers. They can, however, be very misleading if
incorrectly standardized or if the geographic phenomena being mapped are not intrinsically tied to
the areas being shaded. For example, rainfall totals, soil type, and length of commute do not vary
according to county or zip code boundaries. Phenomena being mapped rarely change abruptly at
human-defined boundaries as they appear to do on a choropleth map, and there may be a lot of
variation within an area symbolized with a single color. When working with choropleth maps, a
mapmaker must try to maintain important patterns while simplifying unnecessary complexity.

100 Mapping, Society, and Technology

Choropleth map of population density. This map of population density by county from the 2010 Census relies on users
correctly interpreting the way the data are divided into groups. 8.

5.2 Standardization
An important consideration in thematic mapping, especially in choropleth maps, is whether data are
visualized as a count (e.g., number of people) or as a density (the number of people per square mile).
The primary reason to standardize data is to allow the map reader to compare places that are very
different in terms of size or shape. Comparing a large place like Russia to a smaller place like Ireland
is only really possible by looking at population density instead of population total. Russia has far
more people than Ireland but has a lower population density because it is so large.
Some forms of standardization are spatial such as population density – the number of people per
square mile. Consider the figure below. The map on the top simply shows the count of the number of
people in each state in 2010. Texas and New York have a much larger population than North or South
Dakota, so it should be unsurprising that they also have a darker shading. By contrast, the map on the
bottom is standardized – showing the number of births per square mile. This map is more interesting
because it focuses on people and not state size.

5. Simplification 101

Standardization and population. The top map shows the count of the number of people in each state in 2010. The bottom
map is standardized – showing the number of births per square mile.Jennifer M. Smith, Department of Geography, The
Pennsylvania State University; Data from U.S. Census Bureau. 9

Other types of standardization are non-spatial, such as dividing the cost of housing by the total
household income or dividing the number of students receiving free or reduced-price lunch by the
total number of students at that school. Both the raw count and standardized numbers can be useful,
depending on what you are trying to accomplish. If you are calculating the cost of providing meals
through the free or reduced-price lunch program, you would need to know the number of students

102 Mapping, Society, and Technology

who qualify. If you are trying to understand how much of a student body faces food insecurity, having
a standardized number – the percentage of students receiving free or reduced-price lunch – would
be more useful. When mapping social data, unless the areas being compared are similar in size and
population, it is usually best to standardize numbers.

5.3 Classification
Classification is at the heart of simplification and thematic mapping. Classification can be used to
simplify a wide range of values into something that can be more easily interpreted by the map
audience. Rather than symbolizing each data value with a unique hue or size, values are grouped
together into a smaller number of categories. There are many classification schemes – methods
for breaking up the data into these categories. We will focus on three of the most frequently used
classification schemes: 1) equal interval, 2) quantile, and 3) natural breaks.

5.3.1 Equal Interval
Using the equal interval method, data is split into classes that have an equal range of values (e.g.,
0-100, 100-200, 200-300, and so on). Equal interval is easy to interpret and to compare with other
maps in a series. However, it does not work well for all data distributions. If there are gaps in the
data values, some classes may be empty. If the data are strongly skewed or has outliers, you may end
up with a map where almost all areas are in a single class. Equal interval works best when data are
relatively evenly distributed between the minimum and maximum value, and there are no outliers.

5. Simplification 103

Equal-interval classification. Population density by county in Minnesota, United States using equal-interval
classification. 10

5.3.2 Quantile
With the quantile method, data are split so that there are an equal number of observations in each
class. For example, if you have 100 cities and 5 classes, there would be 20 cities in each class. This
method yields attractive, visually balanced maps and can be useful if you are working with ordinal
data, or those that are ranked (in this case from largest to smallest). Because it puts the same number
of observations in each class without reference to the value of those observations, quantile sometimes
groups very different values in the same class (e.g. 0-11,12-21,22-33,34-70,71-2961). This effect is
especially notable with outliers, or especially low or high values that are out on their own. If one
were to create a quantile classification that is technically exacting, it could put observations with the
same value into different classes; however, mapmakers will often manually change the classification
so that that observations of equal value are not separated, which makes it more like a natural breaks
classification (below).

104 Mapping, Society, and Technology

Quantile classification. Population density by county in Minnesota, United States using quantile classification. 11

5.3.3 Natural Breaks
The natural breaks method attempts to maximize differences between classes and minimize
differences within classes. There are multiple algorithms for how to do this, usually by putting break
points where there are the largest gaps between observation values. This method works especially
well for data with clusters or outliers. One drawback to natural breaks is that it establishes unique
break points for each dataset and thus is difficult to use if you need to make a comparison across
multiple maps (e.g. population change in a city between 1970 and 2010).

5. Simplification 105

Natural breaks classification. Population density by county in Minnesota, using natural breaks classification. The
smaller graphs above are scatter plots of the actual data points, and show the population density of the counties range
from lowest on the left to highest on the right. You can see how the graph of all counties has many low values and just a
few higher values on the right-hand side, which are the populous Twin Cities counties such as Hennepin and Ramsey. 12

5.3.4 Number of Classes
In addition to selecting a classification method, map makers need to decide how many classes or
categories to divide the data into. Having only a few classes can hide important details and draw
attention to geographical patterns that are not actually there. Having too many classes, however, can
make a map confusing.
With more classes, it can be hard to distinguish between different colors, increasing the likelihood
that values in the legend will be misread. There is no ideal number of classes that will work for every
choropleth map. It depends on what you are trying to convey and how your data are distributed.

106 Mapping, Society, and Technology

Different classifications. These three maps use the same classification scheme (quantile) and data (ACS 2010 5-yr
estimate), but show different patterns and locations of where older housing stock exists. 13

In summary, depending on choices made about standardization, classification scheme, and number of
classes, the same data can be visualized very differently. These differences can have a huge influence
on the social and political conclusions drawn from a map. When making maps or looking at a map
someone else has made, be very thoughtful about how your data has been divided into categories.

5. Simplification 107

5.4 Generalization
We have been looking at simplifying data for thematic maps (i.e., grouping data into a smaller
number of categories or areas). Simplifying data and information is also important when making
reference maps, a process known as generalization. Generalization is especially necessary on smallscale maps. For example, as you zoom out on Google Maps, it becomes increasingly impractical to
show small details like residential streets. Even if you wanted to include every building and street
name, objects eventually will be too small to be displayed on your computer screen. A mapmaker
has to choose what features of the map are most important to include and what can be simplified.
Eliminate. Removing objects from a map. A mapmaker may remove features completely if they
become too small to see, too close together to be meaningful, or provide unnecessary detail. For
example, small residential streets have been eliminated from the image on the right.

Elimination. Map generalized by eliminating streets. 14

Simplify. Smoothing or removing the geometry of features on a map. Shorelines, rivers, and borders
between countries often have lots of curves and bends. When working at small scales, a mapmaker
may choose to simplify the shapes of objects or smooth out wiggly lines. Note: yes, this can be
confusing – generalization is a kind of simplification, but generalization also uses an approach called
simplification.

108 Mapping, Society, and Technology

Simplify. Map generalized by smoothing shorelines. 15

Combine. Merging, aggregating, or amalgamating features. A mapmaker might also choose to
combine small objects into a larger object that will be visible when zoomed out at small scales.

Combine. Map generalized by combining islands with mainland. 16

Displace. Moving or enhancing an object. If an object is important for the purpose of the map but
very small or not visible at a selected scale, a mapmaker might enhance the size of the symbol. The
symbol will appear on the map larger than it would be in reality. If multiple important objects are so
close together that their symbols overlap, the map maker might also move them apart. For example,
the road and parking lot in the image on the right have been shifted slightly from their actual location
so that the map is easier to read.

5. Simplification 109

Displace. Map generalized by moving road to enhance separation from shoreline. 17

5.5 Conclusion
The key to making good choices about simplification is to know what you are trying to say with your
map. Now you are familiar with several types of thematic mapping including dot maps, proportional
symbol maps, and choropleth maps. You also have a sense of how standardization and classification
influence what data looks like when it is visualized on a map. We have examined simplifying
data by dividing it into classes (via the process of classification) with three basic approaches: 1)
equal interval, 2) quantile, and 3) natural breaks. We also took a gander at simplifying geometry
by generalizing the actual point, lines, and areas via elimination, combination, simplification, and
displacement. Most importantly, you should be on the lookout for simplification and curious about
its impact on the message of the maps you encounter.

6. Analysis
Laura Matson and Eric Deluca

Analysis is a way of interpreting what is going on in the maps that you encounter and create.
Analytical tools provide ways of engaging with data, understanding spatial patterns, and giving us
a vocabulary for discussing what we see when we look at a map. There are many ways to spatially
analyze the data displayed in maps – too many to mention here. In this chapter, we will focus on a
few particular techniques for analyzing maps, and we will touch on some of the social, economic,
and political implications of map analysis.
This chapter will introduce you to four kinds of analysis:
• point pattern
• autocorrelation
• proximity
• correlation
These categories differ in several ways. They can differ in whether they are looking at location alone,
or location and attributes at the same time. They sometimes differ in whether they look at points and
areas, or just points or areas. These analytical approaches also differ in whether they are looking at
just one theme (say, just population) or more than one theme at a time (such as two maps of counties,
one of population density per county and another of median income).
Depending on the focus of inquiry and the number of themes being analyzed, some maps can be
analyzed using more than one of these methods, and other maps are best analyzed using just one.
In this chapter, we will teach you the differences between these four types of spatial analysis, and
ask you to use these analytical methods to understand maps. Keep in mind that although we draw
distinctions between these types of analysis throughout the chapter, there are many overlaps and
situations in which different analytical methods (particularly proximity and correlation) can be used
in tandem. At the end of this chapter, you will have the basic skills to analyze and interpret maps and
spatial data.

112 Mapping, Society, and Technology

Analysis. Four common methods for analyzing maps.They differ in whether they are looking at location alone, or
location and attributes at the same time. 1

6.1 Point Pattern Analysis
Point pattern analysis looks at the spatial arrangement of the locations of objects or events within a
single theme and does not consider how their attributes vary. In particular, this kind of analysis looks
at the relationship between the locations of objects or events in space relative to the locations of other
objects or events.
The map below looks at the distribution of burglaries near the Thames River in London. Here we are
looking at the locations of specific events—burglaries—which occur when someone enters a building
illegally with the intent to steal something. Note that technically there is a qualitative attribute being
considered – did a burglary occur at a given location or not? – but we are really just interested in
the location of these events. We are not interested in the attributes of any given burglary itself, such
as what was stolen, what was it worth, whether the thief caught, or any number of other kinds of
attributes we could measure or questions we could ask.

6. Analysis 113

London burglaries. This map portrays the distribution of burglaries near the Thames River in London. 2

We use point pattern analysis to describe the pattern of this one particular theme of
interest—locations of burglaries—over the mapped area. Point pattern analysis can help us to see
where spatial patterns of burglaries are occurring, such as if burglars are targeting a particular block
in recent days. As you would guess from the name, point pattern analysis is interested in finding
patterns in locations, in this case where there are any patterns in burglaries. We need a language to
describe these patterns, which is what we explore next.
There are three main types of point patterns – or spatial distributions of locations of entities or events
– in a map: random, uniform, and clustered.

114 Mapping, Society, and Technology

Point patterns. Three general point patterns are random, uniform, and clustered. 3

Random. A random pattern is where locations are distributed seemingly randomly, or in other words,
where the position of any one point is unrelated to the locations of other points. Marketing firms that
conduct phone surveys often want a random distribution of people, for example, so they use methods
to ensure that they choose random locations where people live in a city, state, or nation.
Uniform. A uniform pattern is one in which locations are evenly distributed through space. Maps of
fire stations in a county often display a uniform pattern because fire stations are deliberately spaced
out across a city or county in order to ensure that firefighters can quickly and efficiently access fires
across the area. Another example is the location of wolf packs, in that packs spread out as much as
possible as each pack tries to keep a lot of space between itself and the other packs in order to reduce
conflict over game.
Clustered. A clustered pattern describes when a number of locations are very close to one another,
or in clusters – closer than you would expect if they were randomly patterned. Burglars who target
a particular neighborhood will create a cluster of burglaries on a community’s crime map. Disease is
often clustered in space because the location of one event, such as the flu, makes it more likely that
other flu cases will be nearby, as the flu is spread through close contact among people.

6. Analysis 115

Keep in mind that you will often find multiple point patterns on the same map. The figure below
shows a map of locations of hardware stores in the Midwest of the United States. Looking at this map
with point pattern analysis, you could describe store distribution as uniform in northern Iowa (circled
in red), random in central Wisconsin and the Minnesota/Dakotas border area (yellow), and clustered
around Milwaukee and the Twin Cities (blue).

Clustering in stores. Clustering comparison for the locations of Menards hardware stores in the US Midwest. You could
describe store distribution as uniform in northern Iowa (circled in red), random in central Wisconsin and the Minnesota/
Dakotas border area (yellow), and clustered around Milwaukee and the Twin Cities of Minnesota (blue). 4

6.2 Autocorrelation Analysis
While point pattern analysis is concerned with the relationships among locations on the map,
autocorrelation pertain to both the spatial distribution of location and attributes over an area. census
data, for example, are well-suited for autocorrelation analysis. Though census data may be collected
at the level of individual households, the demographic data are ultimately aggregated and mapped
over an area, rather than tied to specific household locations. Autocorrelation looks at the relationship
of one attribute to itself; or in other words, autocorrelation is a way of analyzing the degree to which
things of the same kind are related.

116 Mapping, Society, and Technology

Recall the map of London burglary locations discussed above. The figure below demonstrates the
difference between a point map (like that above), which is best examined using point pattern analysis,
and an area map, which is better suited to an autocorrelation analysis. The point map above shows
specific locations where burglaries were reported in London while the one below reports these data as
burglary rates for specific neighborhoods, which allows us to compare burglaries among neighboring
areas. These two types of maps are useful for different purposes. If you want to understand the
particular houses or blocks that burglars target in a neighborhood, the point map is better for gleaning
information about the spatial clustering of burglaries. If you work for the city of London and you are
trying to decide how to distribute resources to various police precincts, it is more helpful to you to
know where the most crime is happening across different precinct areas. In that case, knowing the
locations of specific households would not be as useful as having spatial data over an area. If you are
considering buying a house in the neighborhood, either of these maps may help you to understand
your general risk of burglary.

Burglaries by area. Reported burglaries in London aggregated over an area. 5

There are three ways to describe autocorrelation patterns: negative autocorrelation, positive
autocorrelation, or no autocorrelation. These descriptive terms call to mind what has been termed
Tobler’s First Law of Geography: “Everything is related to everything else, but near things are
more related than distant things.” The figure below offers a highly simplified example of how these
autocorrelation descriptions might appear on a very stylized map.

6. Analysis 117

Autocorrelation. Negative, positive, and neutral or no autocorrelation. 6

• Negative autocorrelation describes a pattern that defies Tobler’s Law – the attribute is
uniformly distributed across the area, intersects uniformly with dissimilar attributes, and
is not concentrated.
• Positive autocorrelation corresponds with Tobler’s law – the areas nearest to each other
will display similar patterns or densities of the attribute, and the areas farther away
display different densities of the attributes.
• No autocorrelation indicates that there is no discernible pattern in the distribution of the
attribute.
Another way of thinking about autocorrelation is to ask whether the values of an attribute in one
place are likely to be similar to those in nearby places (positive autocorrelation), very different
from neighboring locations (negative autocorrelation), and whether there is basically no connection
between neighboring places in terms of the attribute (no autocorrelation).
Much of the demographic data that we deal with in this course will display positive autocorrelation.
For instance, a map that shows the burglary rates for all of London demonstrates that boroughs
with high burglary rates are generally located nearer to other boroughs with high or above average
burglary rates. Boroughs with low burglary rates are generally nearer to other boroughs of low or
below average burglary rates.

6.3 Proximity Analysis
Proximity analysis describes the spatial relationships and patterns between locations across two
themes – think of it as point pattern analysis with two different kinds of objects or events. Using
proximity analysis, you can look at the relationship between houses and streets, crimes and
surveillance cameras, patients and disease vectors, or stores and where people live. Beyond the
spatial relationship between multiple points, proximity analysis can help us to make sense of the
world over time and distance.
Proximity analysis can be tremendously useful for public health—determining how diseases spread,
how to predict vulnerability to disease, and how and where to most effectively target interventions.
Dr. John Snow developed one of the classic examples of public health proximity analyses. As noted
in Chapter 1, a cholera outbreak had ravaged London in 1854 and left many public health advocates
and policy makers alarmed and unsure of how to contain the virus. Dr. Snow interviewed residents

6. Analysis 119

and discovered that those who contracted cholera obtained their water from the Broad Street pump,
as in the figure below. Soon after the handle was removed from that pump, the cholera epidemic
subsided.

Proximity and disease. Cholera outbreak and proximity to Broad Street water pump, London 1854, drawn by Dr. John
Snow (pictured). The small black dots represent cholera cases, the large green dots represent water pumps, and the red
dot is the Broad Street Water Pump. The red circle is the concentration of the greatest number of cholera cases,
proximate to the Broad Street pump. 8

To persuade the medical community that cholera was a waterborne rather than an airborne disease,
Dr. Snow created the map shown above to demonstrate the relationship between cholera cases and the
Broad Street pump. Dr. Snow’s map was one of the earliest examples of proximity analysis conducted
to understand spatial disease vectors, and it paved the way for significant expansions of disease
mapping. This information led to the reform of the entire public health system in Victorian England,
which included the Nuisances Removal and Diseases Prevention Act of 1846, and the expansion of
the London sewer system in 1849.
Proximity analysis can also help us to think about different ways of measuring distance. Most of the

120 Mapping, Society, and Technology

time we are interested in Euclidean distance, which is the straight-line distance between two points.
However, unless you are able to scale and hop across buildings, the distance between point A and
point B will be affected by the natural and built environment. Imagine that you are an ambulance
driver, and you need to get a critically injured person to the nearest hospital. The “closest” hospital
based on time (speed of the roads, traffic) or distance (miles of road) might not be the same as
the hospital that is closest in Euclidean distance. Manhattan distance, or “taxicab geometry,” is a
measurement of distance that takes into account the grid like pattern of city streets (as on the island
of Manhattan), and is better suited to understanding navigational proximity. Manhattan distance is
not only useful for thinking about proximity in urban environments. It more generally denotes the
distance you have to travel over a transportation network in order to reach someplace, or network
distance.
Imagine that you are planning a trip to the beautiful Southern Alps of New Zealand. Fox Glacier and
Mt. Cook are two of the most breathtaking sites, and only about 35 km from one another, which is
very proximate using a Euclidean measure of distance. Still, to travel between them by car takes over
5 hours because there are few places to pass through the mountains. Your travel plans must take into
account network distance, or you will be in for a very long and potentially frustrating day of travel!

6. Analysis 121

them by car takes over 5 hours even though they are close in terms of Euclidian distance. 9

6.4 Correlation Analysis
Correlation analysis involves analyzing the spatial relationship between multiple attributes or
themes. In other words, correlation analysis attempts to measure the degree or extent to which two
or more different attributes are spatially related. Although correlation is generally a good method for
looking at multiple attributes aggregated over an area, it can also be used to talk about the relationship

122 Mapping, Society, and Technology

between an aggregated attribute and a specific point. In this way, sometimes there are overlaps
between proximity and correlation analysis. We will deal with these overlaps more comprehensively
later. For now, let’s look at a typical example of correlation analysis: the spatial relationship between
income and education.
Across the world, many governments, NGOs, and media outlets herald the relationship between
higher education and increased income. The figure below shows average incomes of those earning
$75,000 or more and the percentage of people with a bachelor’s degree or higher for census tracts
in the city of Los Angeles. Looking at these two maps side by side, we can see a general correlation
between certain areas with relatively high incomes and higher levels of educational attainment. The
places where the correlations between the two attributes are strong are highlighted with a circle or
oval.

6. Analysis 123

Correlation analysis. Income and educational attainment are correlated in the Los Angeles Area. 10

There are other areas on this map where the correlation is not so clear, as noted by the squares
and rectangles. For instance, in downtown Los Angeles (the square to the upper left of the circle in
roughly the center of the map), we see little correlation between education and income. It’s important
to read your maps carefully when assessing correlation: take a look at the long diagonal census tract
in the upper right of each map. This is Los Angeles County Census Tract 9301.01, and we can see
from the maps that though there is a large population of educated residents, there is insufficient data
as to how many of them are making $75,000 or more per year. This may be because only 119 people
live in this whole area of the San Gabriel mountains. Although a number of areas on the map seem to
support the proposition that higher education correlates to higher incomes, the map also demonstrates
that there are areas that do not adhere to this pattern, and that the situation is likely more complicated
in reality.

124 Mapping, Society, and Technology

6.4.1 Potential mistakes
When performing a correlation analysis, you need to be careful to avoid two common pitfalls: 1)
correlation does not necessarily mean causation, and 2) data are sometimes not interoperable.
Mistake One: Correlation ≠ Causation
As with the income and education example above, just because you see a correlation in the map does
not mean that you have sufficient information to determine causation. Looking back at our maps of
income and education in Los Angeles, we do not have adequate information to claim that higher
education causes higher incomes, or that higher incomes cause higher education. All we can see from
the map is that the two are correlated. If you wish to make an assertion about causation when doing
a spatial correlation analysis, you must consult and cite other robust academic literature that supports
your analysis. In short, you must develop a candidate theory or concept that explains the relation
among your variables.
The correlation/causation fallacy is perpetuated throughout the popular media. For instance, in 2014,
the New York Times Economy section posted an article with the headline: “A Simple Equation: More
Education = More Income.” (Porter 2014). Now this proposition may be true in certain areas, and
at certain levels of aggregation, but we know even from a simple glance at our map that in the Los
Angeles area, there are almost as many places where there is little correlation between income and
education. We simply do not have enough information to understand why some tracts do not display
a correlation between education and income when other nearby tracts do. We cannot make a claim
about causation for certain places or spatial scales without introducing additional peer-reviewed data,
and even then we must be very careful about causal assertions.
Similarly, the proposition in the New York Times article, which argues that higher education does
have a causal relationship to higher income, does not help us to explain these low correlation tracts
either. Though there may be widespread correlations between educational attainment and income
at the state and county level, a critical reading of our map of income and education demonstrates
complexity and the fallacy of a simple correlation equals causation argument. For these reasons,
academic literature is required to clearly state its research methodology and is more transparent
about how data are collected and how conclusions are drawn than popular media sources. Generally,
academic resources are more useful if you are interested in making causal arguments.
Mistake Two: Interoperability oversights
Make sure that the data you are correlating are actually comparable. You’ll want to verify that
the maps you are comparing—and the data that are displayed—are based on similar aggregation
units, categories, and temporalities. You can only draw effective correlations if your maps and data
are interoperable. The figure below shows an example of how correlation analysis can be used

6. Analysis 125

to interpret attribute shifts over time. These figures, produced by the New York Times, look at
correlations in demographic shifts between black and Hispanic populations in South Los Angeles
between 1990 and 2010.

Correlation and interoperability. Spatially interoperable maps that show correlations in demographic shifts over time. 11

Using what you know about census data, take a look at the temporalities, aggregation units, spatial

126 Mapping, Society, and Technology

extent, and attribute categories. Are these maps properly interoperable? In this case, the answer is
yes. These maps cover the same time frames (1990 & 2010), in years when racial categories remained
consistent (Black and Hispanic have the same meanings in the 1990 and 2010 censuses), both maps
aggregate data by census tract (across years when the spatial boundaries of census tracts remained
consistent), and focus on the same spatial extent (South Central Los Angeles). These are maps that
cover all of the interoperability bases and can be effectively analyzed using correlation. If you have
additional questions about interoperability, refer back to the chapter on Data for a more in-depth
discussion.

6.5 Combining Analyses
As mentioned above, there are occasionally overlaps between these different analytical methods, and
the distinctions are not always so clear. Sometimes you can use these multiple methods to analyze
one map. The figure below was published by the New York Times in 2012 as part of a series on fatal
police shootings in Anaheim, California.

Mixing kinds of analysis. Locations of fatal police shootings, percent Hispanic demographic data, and Median
household income, Anaheim, California, United States. 12

6. Analysis 127

Using this figure, we can perform a point pattern analysis by observing the distribution of fatal
police shooting sites. We could conduct an autocorrelation analysis on the top map by looking
at the relationship between the density of Hispanic residents across neighboring tracts (relatively
positive levels of autocorrelation), or the bottom map by comparing median household incomes
across tracts. We can perform a correlation analysis on the two maps side by side, by attempting
to determine whether there is a relationship between the percentage of Hispanic residents and the
median household income. Finally, we might use these figures to understand the proximity between
fatal shooting locations, percentage of Hispanic residents, and/or median household incomes.
Because there is often overlap between correlation and proximity, you could use either or both
analytical methods to understand the spatial relationships between fatal shootings and the aggregated
attributes of percent Hispanic population and median household income.
Let’s look at another example. In the figure below, proximity analysis is called for, since the focus of
inquiry is the location of universities and Fortune 500 companies to one another in the Los Angeles
area. In general, we see a relatively high degree of proximity between universities and Fortune 500
companies. Of course, there are some exceptions. For instance, Pepperdine University, nestled in the
Santa Monica Mountains on the left side of your map, seems relatively isolated at this scale; however,
in Manhattan or network distance terms, it is less than 20 miles, and around a 30-minute drive, from
either Dole Foods or Health Net, the corporations located respectively to the northwest and northeast
of campus.

6.6 Conclusion
In this chapter, we examined a few methods for analyzing maps. We have narrowed our focus to
four general categories of analysis: point pattern, autocorrelation, proximity, and correlation. These
categories differ in key ways, particularly in terms of whether they look at location alone, or location
and attributes at the same time, and whether they are looking at just one theme or more than one
theme at a time. They also sometimes differ in whether they look at only points, only areas, or both
points and areas. Regardless of approach, it is important to not lose sight of the bigger picture, to
remember that you can sometimes use multiple forms of analysis with the same map, and to remain
critical of causal claims based only upon correlation.

7. Lying With Maps
Eric Deluca and Sara Nelson

You’ve learned many different ways that you can represent data and modify your maps. Geographer
Mark Monmonier argues that all of these little modifications—smoothing of geographic features,
choices about classification scheme, aggregation of data, or clever use of hue—represent little “lies.”
He writes, “To portray meaningful relationships for a complex, three-dimensional world on a flat
sheet of paper or a video screen, a map must distort reality…There’s no escape from the cartographic
paradox: to present a useful and truthful picture, an accurate map must tell white lies.” (1996)
White lies include all sorts of cartographic strategies, including symbolization, generalization, and
unintentionally misleading mistakes. Then there are the other kinds of lies—propaganda maps,
advertising maps, maps for military defense and disinformation, and maps that push a particular
political perspective. As a critical map reader and map maker, it is imperative that you be able to
identify and understand all of the ways that maps lie. In this chapter, we are going to focus on how
and why maps lie, whether innocently or not so innocently.
By the end of this chapter, you should be able to critically read the maps that you encounter in
your daily life—whether simple informational maps or maps with a more complex social or political
message—and understand the strategies that the mapmakers have chosen to promote a particular
message or highlight specific data features. In order to be a critical map reader, pay attention to the
guiding questions in the box on the right.
The various mapping strategies that you’ve learned about in this course all work together to produce a
specific result in the final map. The mapping choices that are made can have a big impact on the final
product. As we will see a little later in this chapter, these choices—and the lies that they tell—can
also have real-world consequences for people and societies.
This chapter will introduce you to guiding questions in thinking about lying maps:
• Who made this map and why?
• What is included and what is excluded from the map?
• What is the source of the data on this map?
• Which modification strategies are at work in this map? What is the effect?

132 Mapping, Society, and Technology

7.1 Little lies
7.1.1 Projection
All maps inherently include white lies and subtle misrepresentations: these white lies are
fundamental to the very act of mapping! Think back to our discussion of projection. Recall that
only a 3-dimensional object is able to preserve both shape and area, so anytime you translate a
3-dimensional object onto a 2-dimensional surface, you must choose how you are going to distort the
object.
This misrepresentation is a form of lying with projection. One example that has garnered much
attention is the difference between the Mercator and Gall-Peters projections. The Mercator projection
was created by Flemish cartographer Gerardus Mercator in 1569 and is used in many settings, from
classrooms to Google Maps and other online services. This map was primarily made for navigation
and it preserves angles and shapes well. The major drawback to this projection is that it does not
preserve area, so that countries near the poles appear much larger than they should relative to
countries near the equator. Greenland has only 7-percent the land area of Africa, for example, but it
appears to be just as large on the map.
In contrast, the Gall-Peters projection preserves area at the cost of shape (e.g., Greenland is
significantly distorted but the size of its area is correct in comparison to Africa). Dr. Arno Peters in
the 1970s argued that the Mercator projection could introduce bias into the perception of the world,
given that countries in the northern latitudes were perceived as much larger than those closer to
the equator. As a result, Peters argued, the Mercator projection shows a northern-centric bias and
alters the world’s perception of the importance of the global south. He offered an alternative, the
Peters projection, that better preserved area. It turns out that this project existed long before, having
actually been invented by James Gall in the 1800s, but the projection is usually termed the GallPeters projection to recognize Peters’ argument.

7. Lying With Maps 133

Lying with projections. The Mercator and Gall-Peters projections are both correct in the sense of being good projections
but present the world differently. 1

7.1.2 Symbolization
Because it is impossible to show or even to acquire all of the information that could be mapped in
a particular area, symbolization is a common way in which mapmakers “lie” in order to present or
highlight certain information.
Compare the Google Maps road map of Boston in the figure below to its satellite image equivalent.
The image and map represent the same area, but in the road map, Google uses symbolization to tell

134 Mapping, Society, and Technology

white lies—highlighting different roadways using size and hue (federal highways in thick orange,
state highways in yellow, county roads in thick white, city roads in thin white), different shapes to
signify different types of highways, and different label styles for different towns and neighborhoods
in the area. These forms of lying with symbolization help to fulfill one of the central purposes of
Google Maps: clear presentation of information. You would be hard-pressed to use the raw imagery
to do useful things like drive around Boston or find locations like Cambridge. On the other hand, the
image could be more useful to make guesses about urban land cover in the Boston region or how
deep the water is in the harbor.

Lying with symbolization. Google Maps view of Boston and satellite view of Boston are of the same area but use
symbolization differently. 2

Cartograms are another way of lying with symbolization. Cartograms are maps that distort area
or distance by substituting another thematic variable. Because of the dramatic distortions that
cartograms produce, you might consider them to be telling more than white lies. However,
cartograms are just different ways of symbolizing the same data in order to tell a story. The big lies
that we will deal with in the next section are lies that are told for very specific purposes or for eliciting
particular reactions. Cartograms are considered white lies here because they are just another set of
symbolization choices that affect the representation of data on your map.
The figure below is an example of a map showing the number of people and amount of wealth per
country in 2015. Note how the size of any given country is not displayed in accordance with the land
mass of that country, but in fact corresponds to the number of people living there or its total wealth.
This map gives you, very quickly and effectively, a read on which countries have the most people
and most money.

7. Lying With Maps 135

Lying with cartograms. Population total and wealth by country in 2015. Note how the size of countries on the map is not
their actual area but instead proportional to the attribute being measured, population or wealth. 3

7.1.3 Standardization
How and whether data is standardized also has a huge impact on the story that the map tells. The
maps in the figure below represent poverty data from the 2000 US census. The top map standardizes
data by the percentage of the population – the number of people living in poverty relative to the total
population of that census tract. The bottom map is based on raw numbers for how many people are

136 Mapping, Society, and Technology

living in poverty in the census tract. By failing to account for poverty as a percentage of the total
population, the bottom map tells a much bigger lie about poverty levels in the US.

Lying with standardization. Poverty as a percentage versus poverty as a raw number. These maps represent poverty data
from the 2000 US Census but differ in their standardization. 4

7.1.4 Classification
Classification matters. Choices you make about how to classify your data can have a big impact on
the story that your map tells. The maps here show how you can lie with classification. The three
maps in the figure below each use the same data, the same number of classes, the same color scheme
and the same standardization, yet each tells a very different story about poverty in the US, depending
upon the classification scheme. The first map classifies the data using equal interval, the second using
natural breaks, and the third using a quantile scheme.

7. Lying With Maps 137

Lying with classification. Poverty via equal interval, natural breaks, and quantile classifications. The three maps use the
same data, the same number of classes, the same color scheme and standardization, yet each tells a very different story
about poverty in the US. 5

The figure below shows three maps of 2000 census poverty data. Each uses a quantile
classification scheme. The only difference is the number of classes. See how the number of
classes impacts your perception of poverty levels in the US. Although there are some areas that
demonstrate patterns of poverty across the three maps, as you increase the number of classes, you
get a more nuanced picture of how poverty is distributed across the country.

138 Mapping, Society, and Technology

Lying with classes. Poverty via quantile classifications with differing number of classes. The three maps use the same
data and color scheme yet tell a different story about poverty in the US. 6

7.1.5 Aggregation, Classification, and the Ecological fallacy
Recall that data are often aggregated. They are often collected at one scale, such as the household
or neighborhood, and then reported at much broader scales, such as the census tract or county.
This is termed aggregating the data. While aggregation can be very helpful in terms of preserving
privacy or presenting a broader and synoptic view, it can also lead to the ecological fallacy, or the
assumption that a characteristic or value calculated for a group in aggregate can be applied to an

7. Lying With Maps 139

individual member of that group. In other words, aggregated data make it hard to assume or guess at
the characteristics of any given individual found in that aggregated area.
Imagine you are comparing the income of two blocks, each being composed of five households.
Block A has an average household income of $48,000 while Block B has an average household
income of $40,000, per the figure below. In which area are you more likely to find a household with
a higher income? If you chose Block A—the area with the higher average income total—then you
were tricked by the ecological fallacy. In fact, there is no way to know from aggregated data alone
what the situation is like for an individual within a group. The figure shows one of many possible
scenarios under which four out of five households in Block B have higher incomes than households
in Block A.

Ecological fallacy. Consider this scenario in which Block A has a higher aggregated average income but mostly lower
individual values than Block B. 7

Watch out for the ecological fallacy whenever you are interpreting maps, or you might come to false
conclusions about the people who live in a neighborhood or other areas!
The danger of the ecological fallacy for the map reader is closely tied to the subtle ways that
mapmakers can lie with aggregation, often in combination with classification. The figure below
illustrates voting returns for the 2012 US presidential election. The map on the left represents
counties by their majority vote in the election. Red signifies counties where a majority of residents
voted for the Republican candidate, Mitt Romney; blue signifies counties with a majority vote for the

140 Mapping, Society, and Technology

Democratic candidate Barack Obama. The map on the right attempts to reveal a little more nuance
in voting patterns, by using a red—purple—blue scale to indicate percentages of votes, while the one
on the left is simpler and more prone to the ecological fallacy. These maps are both entirely correct.
They differ in how they classify their underlying data into either two categories or by not classifying
the data and instead using hue and value to represent fine differences among counties.

Lying with aggregation and classification. Lying, or rather telling different truths, about the United States presidential
election in 2012. The map on the left shows counties by their majority vote in the election, where red means counties
where a majority of residents voted for the Republican candidate and blue signifies counties voting Democrat. 8

From your knowledge of the ecological fallacy, you know that even at the level of the county, this

7. Lying With Maps 141

map does not accurately represent the party affiliation, beliefs, or voting patterns of each person in
the county. The data are aggregated to the county level and are classified differently than the data
in the map on the right. This sort of aggregation and classification is useful because it allows us
to distinguish between voting patterns in different parts of the country—rural/urban variations, for
instance. The map on the right is still lying of course—not all residents in the US voted, and those
who did were not necessarily voting for the endorsed Republican or Democratic candidate—but it is
trying to provide a more accurate picture of the data. Both maps lie in order to give a picture of the
election outcome in particular parts of the country.
Consider the cartogram version of the election map, below. The cartogram distorts area based on
county-level election returns, so counties with larger populations appear bigger. The cartogram lies
by distorting area, but in some ways, it gives us a clearer picture of election results. In the standard
county aggregation map above it appears that the US voted strongly Republican; but the cartogram
shows that many Republican-leaning counties have relatively small populations, while counties with
larger populations mainly voted for the Democratic candidate.

Election cartogram. This cartogram of election results distorts apparent county area by the number of returns, so
counties with larger populations appear bigger. 9

142 Mapping, Society, and Technology

7.1.6 Aggregation and Zonation
We have looked at how data are aggregated to larger areas and how this process of aggregation can
affect how data are interpreted, such as causing the potential for the ecological fallacy. In addition
to aggregating data, we can also zone it differently, which is another way of saying we can draw
an almost infinite array of differing boundaries for any given aggregation. We often use county
boundaries in our analyses, for example, but the boundaries of counties are arbitrary. They were
drawn over time according to a range of different principles, such as where a river flowed or where
settlement was being encouraged. Population data is often aggregated and reported by county but
they could be (and often are) reported via other zonations, such as zip codes, phone-number area
codes, school districts, or watershed boundaries.
Importantly, the way in which data are aggregated and where the boundaries of zones are drawn
can easily change data patterns and analysis outcomes. Depending on the scale at which you look
at a geographic pattern, you can derive completely different results from the exact same underlying
data. This is called the modifiable areal unit problem. For example, consider the rate of a disease in
a population. Individuals at specific locations become sick, but health officials often want to know
the broader trends of diseases. For this reason – and to protect the privacy of patients – they may
count the number of cases by block, zip code, or another zonation. But artificially breaking up space
into these larger areas can change the apparent patterns of disease. The figure below illustrates this
for deaths from respiratory problems in Ottawa, Canada. Each map uses the same underlying data
but groups or zones cases differently: by a health department aggregation, by neighborhood, and by
census tract. Each classes spatial units into quartiles, or in other words, divides the areas into four
equal groups by how many people are dying in those areas. Note that these three maps all use the
same exact underlying data and are just using different ways of zoning the groups. Nonetheless, these
maps look very different, highlighting the challenge of the modifiable areal unit problem.

Health and zonation. These maps all show data on where people die from respiratory problems in Ottawa, Canada. Each
map uses the same underlying data but but groups or zones cases differently. Each categorizes spatial units into quartiles.
10

7. Lying With Maps 143

In addition to zoning, the modifiable areal unit problem can result from aggregation. Consider the
figures below of solar potential in the lower 48 United States. Solar potential refers to the suitability
of a particular place to develop solar power. These data are from the National Renewable Energy
Laboratory and these maps were created by Anthony Robinson (2010). The first map shows the
average annual solar potential by state. In other words, these data are aggregated by state. You can
see right away that some states look better than others.

Solar potential by state. Annual solar potential by state, which measures the suitability of a particular place to develop
solar power. 11

The same underlying data aggregated to counties instead makes it look like a lot of states that were
shown in one color at the state level actually include several categories of solar potential when you
look at the data by county.

develop solar power. 12

The third map shows the original underlying data on which the other two maps were based. These
original data calculate solar potential in 10 kilometer grid cells. You can see how the state and
county boundaries compare to the raw data and how aggregation changes the apparent distribution of
phenomena.

7.2 Big Lies
There are other mapping lies that are not so innocent. In the remainder of this section, we are going
to focus on some examples of maps that are lying more deliberately—or working hard to represent a
very particular story. Keep in mind, though, that there is a fine line between the map-maker intending
clarity vs. pushing an agenda. The first example addresses the ways that aggregation and zonation
are manipulated to achieve a particular political end.

7.2.1 Political Lies: Gerrymandering
There are many ways that maps are modified in order to promote particular political perspectives
or outcomes. Political lies in mapping take the form of propaganda, campaign advertisements,
and politically-motivated resource maps. One particularly important political lie is gerrymandering,

146 Mapping, Society, and Technology

the manipulation of the boundaries of an electoral constituency in order to favor a particular
political party or group. Because US Congressional districts are reapportioned in the years following
the decennial census, political leaders in power at that time may take the opportunity to redraw
borders—even convoluted gerrymandered borders—that favor their party’s continued political
success.
Gerrymandering has been an important and highly contested part of the US political process
for quite some time. The term was coined in the Boston Gazette in reference to the contrived
redistricting schemes designed to secure the political power of Massachusetts Governor Elbridge
Gerry’s Democratic-Republican Party. In 1812, the Gazette published the illustration seen below
comparing Gerry’s convoluted redistricting to the image of a salamander-like creature. Thus,
“gerrymandering” was born. This political technique has a storied history, and is a powerful way of
lying with maps: gerrymandering works to consolidate or distribute political power, with such tactics
as isolating opponents (known as packing) and breaking up areas of opposition (cracking).

7. Lying With Maps 147

Gerrymandering. The term gerrymandering was coined by Elkanah Tisdale in the Boston Gazette in 1812. The
newspaper published an editorial cartoon that showed the elongated shape of the aggregated areas in the form of a
salamander. 14

In the figure below, there are fifty precincts (the smallest area in which votes are tallied) that can be
distributed among five districts. At the precinct level, there are proportionally more green voters than
yellow (60% versus 40%), and so all other things being equal, you would expect non-gerrymandered
districts to reproduce a proportionate outcome. Out of the five total districts, you would expect three
to vote majority green and two majority yellow, which corresponds to the 60% versus 40% split of
the underlying precincts. Grouping precincts into districts yield different outcomes if principles of
gerrymandering are used, namely packing and cracking. Under Districting A, the number of districts

148 Mapping, Society, and Technology

won by each party is proportional to the number of voters for each party: 60% for green and 40% for
yellow. Districting B cracks the yellow precincts in a way that allows green to dominate all districts,
yielding 100% for green and 0% for yellow. Districting C packs and cracks green in a way that lets
yellow eke out an upset win with three districts, which is the reverse of the underlying voting patterns
of the precincts.

Packing and cracking. Overall, at the precinct level, there are proportionally more green voters than yellow (60% vs.
40%). Three different ways of grouping precincts into districts yield different outcomes. Under Districting A, the
number of districts won by each party is proportional to the number of voters for each party. Districting B cracks the
yellow precincts in a way that allows green to dominate all districts. Districting C packs and cracks green in a way that
lets yellow gain an upset win with three districts. 15

7. Lying With Maps 149

Gerrymandering is alive and well today. It is widely practiced in the US, as you can see by some
of the more outrageous examples of congressional gerrymandering in the figure below. This type
of redistricting and reapportionment can have very real consequences for people who live in these
areas, limiting their representation, protecting incumbent seats, and compromising access to federal
funding. Some have argued that gerrymandering is akin to legal election rigging.

Gerrymandering in the United States. These maps show examples of gerrymandered districts in the United States; these
are just a few of many. North Carolina’s 12th congressional district in 2016 was example of packing, with
predominantly African-American residents (top). Illinois’s 4th congressional district packs two Hispanic areas while
meeting the requirement for contiguity running along Interstate 294 (middle). Ohio’s 7th is an example of “cracking”
where the urban population of Columbus, Ohio is split off into more conservative suburbs. 16

For incarcerated populations and those who live in districts where prisons are located,

150 Mapping, Society, and Technology

gerrymandering may have an even bigger impact. In order to understand how prison-based
gerrymandering works, you’ll have to think back to what you learned about how census data
is collected, analyzed, and aggregated. For certain data categories, the Census Bureau counts
incarcerated people as residents of the town where their prison is located, rather than the town where
they resided prior to their imprisonment. Because census data are currently used for redistricting at
all levels of federal, state and local governance, the particular cities and census tracts where people
are counted is very important for ensuring representation and apportionments.
In the US, the prison population has risen significantly in the past few decades. Advocates for
ending prison-based gerrymandering argue that counting prisoners based on their incarceration
location—particularly when those prisoners are barred from voting in 48 states—gives exponential
political power to the small non-incarcerated population in the area, and their representatives. When
this happens, advocates argue, the practice siphons political representation and funding from other
districts in the state—particularly those districts that bear the greatest costs of crime.
The prison gerrymandering dynamic is evident in existing census maps. Let’s return to the Los
Angeles area income and education maps that you encountered in chapter 6. The figure below
contains details about Los Angeles County Census Tract 2060.20. The map shows us that income
and education are not correlated in this area. Looking at the data, we see that only 5.328% of the
population in this tract has a Bachelor’s degree, but 91.453% has annual income of $75,000+. Only
when we dig a little deeper does this particular tract begin to make a little more sense. Census
Tract 2060.20 is home to the Twin Towers Correctional Facility and the Men’s Central Jail. The
ACS and census currently tabulate all of the prisoners who live in the Twin Towers and Men’s
Central jail as residents, and takes into account their education level. However, the census does not
include incarcerated populations in household income or poverty calculations, so the map on the
right only takes into account the incomes of the surrounding community. You can see how this kind
of data collection method might make it very difficult to adequately account for population, ensure
reasonable representation, and manage appropriations in prison-based communities, as well as the
communities from which incarcerated populations come.

Prison gerrymandering. This detail of Census Tract 2060.20 shows income and education (Left: Income More than
$75,000; Right: Education Bachelor’s Degree or More). These maps show us that income and education are not
correlated in this area. 17

7.2.2 Geopolitical Lies: Contested Territories
There are other types of lies that have more to do with navigating the complexities of international
geopolitics. For instance, in many parts of the world there are territories that are contested between
two or more states. Depending on the political considerations of the mapmaker and the audience,
regional maps may represent these territories very differently. Jammu & Kashmir is a territory in the

152 Mapping, Society, and Technology

northwestern region of South Asia along the borders of India, Pakistan and China. Since the 1947
partition of British India created the contemporary states of India and Pakistan, the two countries
have been engaged in a territorial dispute over the region. Jammu and Kashmir are geopolitically
significant, and are the source of the Indus River and its tributaries, which sustain India and
Pakistan’s water supplies.

Situating Kashmir. Jammu & Kashmir is a territory in the northwestern region of South Asia along the borders of India,
Pakistan and China. 18

India and Pakistan both claim Jammu and Kashmir. The figure below shows how Google Maps
images of the region appear differently whether the search is conducted in the US (which considers

7. Lying With Maps 153

the two states’ territorial claims on Jammu and Kashmir to be unsettled) or India (which reasserts its
claim to Jammu and Kashmir in the map).

Contested Kashmir. Google Maps will show the contested Kashmir region differently depending on whether the user is
in the United States or India.19

Different media organizations have also favored different representations of Jammu and Kashmir, as
seen below.

representations of Jammu and Kashmir. 20

7.2.3 Commercial Lies: Advertising
In 2009, AT&T filed a lawsuit in federal court against Verizon. The complaint? AT&T alleged
that a Verizon ad campaign featuring coverage maps of each carriers’ 3G cellular data service
misrepresented the actual reach of AT&T’s wireless service and misled customers. AT&T sued
Verizon over a “lying map.” AT&T was concerned that the map would make customers think that
its entire wireless network was reflected in the spotty map below, while Verizon contended that the
map accurately reflected the differences between the two carriers’ 3G networks. AT&T dropped the
suit about a month after it was filed, but it raises some important questions about lying maps in
advertising.

7. Lying With Maps 155

Lying competition. AT&T alleged that a Verizon ad campaign “There’s a Map for That” featured coverage maps of each
carrier’s cellular data service that misrepresented the actual reach of AT&T’s wireless service and misled customers. 21

For mobile service providers, maps that demonstrate extensive coverage are becoming increasingly
important as companies like Verizon and AT&T compete for larger shares of the marketplace.
However, many consumers have expressed frustration over what they perceive as inaccurate
coverage maps in the advertising materials of mobile phone service providers. In recent years, a
number of apps and websites have popped up to crowd-source mobile phone coverage data across
the US and paint a more accurate picture of mobile network coverage. The figure below shows a
crowd-sourced map from one such site, OpenSignal.com.

156 Mapping, Society, and Technology

Open mapping. This crowd-sourced mobile network coverage map from OpenSignal.com is arguably less biased than
those offered by companies because firms have a vested interest in making their product seem better than competing
offerings. 22

7.3 Conclusion
In making maps, we tell many lies. Small lies include all sorts of standard cartographic strategies,
including projection, symbolization, standardization, classification, aggregation, and zonation. Then
there are the other kinds of lies—gerrymandering, propaganda maps, maps that push a particular
political perspective, and misleading advertising maps. As a critical map reader and map maker, it is
imperative that you be able to identify and understand the ways that maps lie.

8. Surveillance
Laura Matson and Steven Manson

We live in a surveillance society and always have. Multiple organizations track our daily activities,
and often with the help of geospatial technologies including mobile phones, satellite remote sensing,
and sophisticated mapping systems. The practice of tracking populations is not new. Governments
in particular have long conducted surveillance of individuals and groups for centuries, although
they have been joined by a host of companies and other groups. For most of human history,
however, surveillance was limited in scope because it required a lot of human resources. The advent
of computers and computing networks has vastly expanded the ability of government agencies,
commercial firms, and other organizations to monitor millions of people.
This chapter will introduce you to:
• Surveillance as a concept that has long been a part of human societies
• Drivers of the new surveillance society
• Surveillance from both the inside and outside of our daily lives

8.1 Surveillance
In many ways, we are living in a surveillance society and have been since the earliest of human
civilizations. Multiple organizations track our daily activities, often with the help of geospatial
technologies. The practice of tracking populations is not new. Governments, in particular, have long
conducted surveillance of individuals and groups, and many countries have conducted a population
census continually for centuries. From the 1800s onward, most governments have tracked their
populations. Besides basic demographics, governments gather health surveys, migration information,
data on border crossings, crime, and more (as seen the the map below).
For much of human history, the opportunities for surveillance were physically bound in important
ways. For example, governments have always employed people to follow other people around to
keep them under observation, but this is expensive and time consuming. It is also difficult to monitor
people passing across borders or to count citizens once a decade at their home via a census. This
kind of door-to-door census is tremendously costly to conduct because it involves paying thousands
of enumerators to go to homes and talk to people in addition to the money and time spent mailing,
reading, and tabulating surveys. Since around the mid-Twentieth century, however, technology has

160 Mapping, Society, and Technology

made it much easier for governments, companies, groups, and individuals to surveil large numbers
of people.

State surveillance. Map of crimes against persons, crimes against properties and education in France (1829).
Governments gather information on health, migration, crime, and more/. 1

There are three recent drivers of expanded surveillance, which threaten to fundamentally rewrite
the rules about how government agencies, commercial firms, and other organizations keep tabs on
individuals.
The first major driver is our ever-improving technology which has become less expensive and much
faster.
• Computerization. From the 1940s onward, the advent of computers heralded new

8. Surveillance 161

capacities for observing and tracking societies. Computers are very helpful for keeping
records and making connections among records, and they can store large amounts of
information.
• Networks. From the 1980s onward, communication networks made it easier for computers
to talk to one another. Organizations could share information more easily and it became
easier to collate information from many different places.
• Miniaturization. Both computers and networks benefit from miniaturization. Computers
are becoming faster and networks are becoming almost omnipresent. Mobile phones exist
because computers are now small enough to fit in your pocket while remaining capable of
networking to other computers.
The second driver of expanded surveillance is the rise of the politics of fear and security. Although
by most measures we are living in a safer world than ever before, many people feel less safe and
less secure than in the past. The reasons for this mismatch are numerous and complex, but in general
there is evidence that bad news travels faster than it ever has before. The news is filled with stories
of danger and tragedy from around the world, stories we would not have heard about by just relying
on the newspaper or evening news. We have also seen an increase of, and desire for, a range of
surveillance technologies, such as cameras put in private and public spaces in the name of safety.
These technologies are arguably making us safer in some cases, but at what cost to personal liberty
and privacy? These trends are also related to both perceived and actual increases in terrorism, along
with related threats such as cybercrime. This has ushered in a new era in which governments have
sought more powers of surveillance. The Patriot Act in the US, for example, substantially increased
the powers of government to track citizens through their phone records and online activities, often
with little or no oversight. While these measures have undoubtedly helped protect people from harm,
they have also introduced a new and potentially dangerous level of government scrutiny into the lives
of all people.

162 Mapping, Society, and Technology

Surveillance cameras. These cameras have become ubiquitous. This one is part of the Memphis Police Department’s
Blue Crush Taking Back Our Streets initiative. 2

The third major driver in the growth of surveillance is the personalization of tracking. In general,
we have moved from a situation where a person was observed or tracked in one or two places, like
at a border crossing, to a situation where a person can be observed directly or indirectly at almost
all times. In some cities, a person can be seen by dozens of cameras a day and their face or license
plate number can automatically be matched against databases. Essentially every online interaction
you have, be it looking up directions on a map or looking at shoes on a website, is tracked by multiple
organizations, ranging from private sector companies to government agencies. If you carry a mobile

8. Surveillance 163

phone, you are also carrying a device with a microphone, camera, and location tracker. These are just
a few of many possible examples of the ways in which you are monitored on a regular basis.

8.2 Inside Surveillance
Often we think of surveillance as happening outside of daily life – we watch movies where secret
agents use satellites, telescopes, and microphones to spy on criminals or enemy agents or our hapless
heroes. Really, though, much of the surveillance we experience is “from the inside,” in that we
willingly purchase spy gear and carry it with us in order to be spied on.
Many of our possessions, including clothing and other items we buy in stores, have radio-frequency
identification (RFID) tags built into them, which can continue to be accessed even after their original
purpose has been fulfilled. These RFID tags help to prevent shoplifting, but it is possible for anyone
to read these chips; so, for example, if you buy a pair of jeans from the Gap, a Levi’s store could read
the chip in your jeans months later. Companies constantly experiment with different ways of using
these and other kinds of technologies. Your student ID card likely has an RFID chip embedded in it,
as do many of the cards you carry. These chips are helpful because they allow users to open locks
and doors with the swipe of a card instead of having to use a key for every door. Some universities
have gone a step further, however, and have installed special doorways that detect students’ IDs
automatically. They are experimenting with using this technology to track attendance in classes, use
of the cafeteria, or to make for easy entrance to dorms. Of course, you can imagine many other uses
to which this system could be applied. How would you feel knowing that the university knows your
every move on campus?
Our mobile phones are tremendously useful, but many different parties – phone companies,
marketing firms, government agencies – have varying degrees of access to the microphone, camera,
data, and location of your phone. These organizations know who uses the phone, what they use the
phone for, and where the phone is at all times. One advantage to this situation is that companies can
offer location based services (LBS), or services and products that take into account where you are. If
you search for a coffee shop, for example, your phone will tell you the locations of the nearest shops,
give you ratings, and provide directions. Of course, companies like Google or Apple provide search
results that are biased toward stores or chains that pay advertising fees. They are also interested in
tracking the people you spend time with; features such as facial recognition or the opportunity to
‘tag’ or identify friends and family in photos are often billed as a great way to help organize photos,
but they also provide a way for companies to better understand your social networks.
Most of our activities online are tracked by companies and governments. There is always a tug of war
occurring behind the scenes over the balance between protecting the privacy of people being tracked
versus using this tracking information to learn about people, their activities, and their relationships.

164 Mapping, Society, and Technology

The companies that power the internet, such as Google, Apple, and Facebook, keep track of every
person who uses their services. They track what you buy, with whom you communicate, the stories
you read, and the people with whom you associate. Much of this is spatially aware knowledge, in the
sense that these companies can track with whom you travel or spend time.
One side effect of many people being tracked is that this continuous and automated collection yields
a lot of data that can be used in various ways, some inadvertent. These data are typically used by
companies to develop better products and sell advertising while providing a useful service. There are
many mobile phone applications (or “apps”) on fitness, for example, that will use your location to
help you plan running or biking routes, monitor your exercise routines, or encourage you to push
yourself further. Strava is one such application that is used by millions of people around the globe.
In addition to using the data for its own purposes, the firm shares its data as maps. One unanticipated
side effect of this data sharing is that it became apparent that members of the armed forces and
security services of various countries were using the app and inadvertently sharing their data. These
data could be used to create high-resolution maps of how, where, and when people moved around on
a military base such as the Bagram Air Base, the largest U.S. military base in Afghanistan, pictured
here. This level of specificity poses a range of security risks. This is just one example of the many
potential uses and misuses, inadvertent or otherwise, that may result from the mass surveillance of
people using their mobile devices.

8. Surveillance 165

Mobile phone tracking. Users of a fitness app shared their locations and these data in turn were used to make a map that
showed details of a military installation. 3

Most transactions have some sort of receipt or indication of their occurrence and we have many
different kinds of records about who we are and what we do: internet activity, credit card purchases,
debit card activity, airline tickets, car rentals, medical records, educational transcripts, driver’s
licenses, utility bills, tax returns, and records of most life events, including birth, marriage, divorce,
and death. These records are collected and collated by governments and private firms, and other
organizations. Government agencies, political parties, advertisers, and internet companies like
Google or Facebook are just a few of many organizations that maintain vast amounts of information
on individuals from the moment they are born until when they die. It is very difficult for individuals
to gain access to these data or learn how they are used.
Much of the time, this tracking occurs with our blessing: we choose to be tracked in order to get
better search results, deals on services, travel directions, and so on. There are other times, however,
when these data are misused to breach the privacy of individuals, or when they are stolen by
cyber-criminals and used to commit fraud. These same dynamics also hold true for governments.

166 Mapping, Society, and Technology

Local, state, and federal authorizes use cell phone information in various ways to help catch people
suspected of crimes, but these technologies are often also used to monitor citizens for potential
criminal behavior. There have been many, and will likely continue to be many, instances where these
data are misused by trusted authorities in ways that skirt or sometimes just break the law.
Beyond our phones, there are a variety of ways in which computers, networks, and miniaturization
have made it easier to track people. GPS receivers are small and powerful, making it easy for
security or investigative agencies to place them on a suspect’s car or person and track them for
months. Insurance companies offer drivers the opportunity to have GPS trackers placed in their cars
in order to get a better idea of how a person drives, which can lead to better rates – at the cost of
having a company know your every move. Many new cars have GPS-based services built in, such as
emergency roadside assistance, which can be a real help when you have car trouble. These companies
often sell this information, however, to other companies that want to know where you travel or where
you live.
These are just a few of many examples of how we are all tracked in the course of our daily lives.

8.3 Outside Surveillance
A growing amount of surveillance also happens from “the outside,” by which we mean when you are
being observed or tracked in ways that do not rely on devices you carry on your person or are derived
from your interactions with computers.
A prime example of surveillance from the outside is remote sensing technology, which is rapidly
improving. Until recently, the spatial resolution of these sensors was not good enough to see or track
people, but now there are several companies and governmental agencies that offer space-based and
airborne sensors that can track individual people and cars with ease. Some commercial systems can
track every single person and car in a city over the course of hours, and military and government
systems are much better. Military-level surveillance techniques can even be applied to, for example,
apprehending suspected criminals in US cities or tracking literally thousands of cars at the same time
as they move along city streets.
More prosaically, most cities are carpeted with surveillance cameras mounted on any number
of objects – stores, houses, light poles, or traffic signs. There are some urban areas where you
cannot walk virtually anywhere without being captured on camera. For some people and places,
these cameras are seen as a good thing. The site www.videosurveillance.com/communitycam/, for
example, argues for more, and better camera coverage in order to safeguard property and protect
people from harm caused by crime or automobile accidents. In contrast, the New York Civil Liberties
Union’s Surveillance Camera Project warns of the dangers of blanketing cities with cameras,

8. Surveillance 167

especially in how they offer security but at the cost of intruding into the lives of many people by
removing their ability to be anonymous, move through the city freely, and associate with other people
without fear of being watched.
Another emerging technology that is both useful and troubling is facial recognition. Many of the
kinds of data collected about people during the course of their daily lives can be associated with them
because they carry a phone or use a computer. In other words, surveillance from the inside. Leaving a
phone behind or not using a computer can free a person from this form of surveillance, but it does not
prevent other people from taking photos of that person or from cameras from doing so. Increasingly,
these photos and videos are processed by computers that can recognize faces and associate these
faces with other records. Apps on your mobile phone, like Facebook or Google+, can automatically
identify the people in your photos. We are very close to a time when someone can simply point a
phone at you and be able to bring up all sorts of information about you without your knowledge and
consent.
Consider a program being tested in China, called “Xue Liang” or “Sharp Eyes”, a nationwide
surveillance system that uses artificial intelligence to match people from a photo database to the
video feeds from private and public cameras in streets and in homes and businesses. This system is
seen as being helpful because it would allow banks, hotels, airports, apartment buildings, schools,
and other places to identify people and allow them entry automatically. Of course, the police
and security forces are also very interested in being able to track actual or suspected criminals.
Further plans include linking this facial recognition system to medical records, social media posts,
travel plans, and purchases in order to create a single system of pervasive and ubiquitous national
surveillance. The program will eventually give officials the ability to track what people are doing,
where, and with whom.
Perhaps the fastest growing form of surveillance from the outside is one that is also much
like surveillance from the inside namely the profusion of internet connected devices such as baby
monitors and internet-enabled speakers like Google Mini or Amazon’s Alexa or Echo. These are
devices that are always on, always listening and watching, and always feeding information back to
their companies. Of course, people have these devices in their homes because they are helpful—they
can search the internet, order groceries, and monitor whether a child is sleeping peacefully. These
devices also have drawbacks. Companies record and track every utterance or request, feed this
information into their systems in order use it both in house and to sell to other companies. Many
of these devices—especially cameras and toys—are incredibly insecure and are vulnerable to being
hacked or taken over by people in order to spy on you and anyone else who is in your home.
Even when organizations don’t have pieces of information about you in particular, they can make
very good guesses about the sort of things you do, buy, and want based on where you live—with
even small amounts of information. This way of combining location with attributes of the people
who live in a given place is called geodemographics. A product by Esri called “Zip Tapestry” divides

168 Mapping, Society, and Technology

the country up by zip codes and other zonations, and then describes a good guess about who lives in
each area. You can try it yourself at ESRI’s Zip Tapestry.

Geodemographics. Esri’s Zip Tapestry website describes the general categories of people living in a given zip code,
based on a variety of different data. 4

These technologies are very helpful to firms because they help narrow down where their customers
live. Many college and university students can find elements of their lives in the following
description of the “young and restless”:
We’re millennials and coming into our own. We’re young, diverse, well educated, and are
either financing our classes or working in professional/technical sales, and office administration
support positions. Most of us rent and will move for a job. We live alone or share a place in
densely populated areas of large metro areas in the South, West, and Midwest. We can’t do

8. Surveillance 169

without our cell phones; we text, listen to music, pay bills, redeem coupons, get directions, and
research financial information. Not brand-loyal; we shop for the best price. We buy natural/
organic food but will also go for fast food. We want to be the first to show off new electronics,
but we read online reviews before buying. We go online to bank, buy from eBay, access Twitter
and Facebook, and watch TV and movies.

Do you see yourself or someone you know in this description?

8.4 Conclusion
We are steadily moving towards a state of “Total Surveillance,” by which we mean that very few
aspects of our lives will not be observed in some way. Many of the necessary technologies are already
in place and others are getting better with every day.
Issues around the surveillance society are complicated, and it seems as if they will only get more so
as time goes on. When thinking about the good and bad aspects of surveillance, it can help to ask
three key questions when considering a given case or scenario.
• What power relations are involved?
• Who controls the technology?
• What are the implications for privacy vs. security?

Melinda Kernik and Sara Nelson

We will look at ways in which changing mapping technology has become embedded in daily life.
With the development of location-aware technology like smartphones, there has been a big shift in
what is possible to measure, who is collecting data, and how much data is produced. We will examine
how geographic data, produced by diverse groups of people, have been incorporated into scientific
research, disaster relief, and local government services. We will consider changes to mapmaking that
have been made possible through the rise of online user-friendly geospatial tools and easier access to
data. Relatedly, we will think about the “digital divide” between those who have access to mapping
technology and those who do not. We will close the chapter by thinking about how technological
change shapes the way we navigate between places and find information about businesses and
services.
This chapter will introduce you to:
• Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI)
• Democratization of data production and mapping
• Digital divides
• Issues around e-waste
• Various ways maps are used in the real world

9.1 Volunteered Information
You may remember from your learning about data that spatial data has historically been collected
by a small number of experts working for well-funded organizations (government, academia, etc.)
and then made available to the public for use through static maps. Until recently, identifying the
physical location of objects required special training and equipment. Technological developments in
the mid-2000s, however, brought about huge changes in who collects data, how it is collected, and
what types of places and events have data collected about them. Rather than a one-way exchange of
information, it is now possible to produce spatial data using inexpensive, widely available mobile
devices that accurately record spatial location without extensive training.
This form of data, collected by individuals with diverse backgrounds and skill levels, is known as

172 Mapping, Society, and Technology

Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI). VGI makes it possible to map phenomena that take
place over such a large area or short time span that they cannot be recorded by conventional data
practices. VGI also supports groups that can map aspects of daily life ignored by official agencies.
Data collected from cell phones can be used for surveillance, but the examples in this chapter will
focus on the more positive and transparent uses of these new technologies. We will look at three
different ways that VGI is being incorporated into daily practice, such as for science, disaster relief
efforts, and local government.

9.1.1 VGI for Science
VGI offers exciting possibilities for scientific research. When collecting information about how a
phenomenon occurs over space (e.g., the migration of birds from high to low latitudes in winter),
scientists often have a limited number of monitoring sites they can support with trained staff and
funding. Scientists increasingly use spatial data volunteered by enthusiastic citizens to expand what
they can observe. It should be noted that citizen science projects were popular long before cell
phones, but new technologies have increased the number of projects, the spatial accuracy of reported
observations, and the ease of participation. With VGI, data can be collected and processed rapidly
and at very low cost. There are trade-offs, however, in terms of data quality. Even with the most wellintentioned volunteers, it can be difficult to establish consistent practices, coordinate data collection
for all areas of interest, or assess possible errors in the data. In some cases, the volunteers are the
“sensors” – they make observations and report back what they have seen or measured. For example,
with Ebird, volunteers count the number and type of birds they observe, as below. They enter the
information into a website with reports from other birdwatchers. When combined, the data give a
picture of species density and migration patterns.

9. Social Maps 173

Citizen science mapping. Ebird creates maps of bird distribution as reported by volunteer bird watchers on the site. 1

In other cases, information has already been collected but volunteers assist scientists in going
through large quantities of data to identify important patterns. With Seafloor Explorer, for example,
volunteers mark the number and type of species they observe in photographs of the seafloor. The
location of each photo is known, helping scientists understand spatial patterns in marine biology.

174 Mapping, Society, and Technology

Crowd sourced discovery. Volunteers mark sea star locations in an image from Seafloor Explorer. These locations can
then be used by scientist to better track and understand the sea stars. 2

9.1.2 VGI for Disaster Response
When a disaster strikes, getting good information quickly is essential. By using data created by
affected populations, emergency aid workers can get a better understanding of what is happening on
the ground and respond appropriately. In January 2010, a massive earthquake shook Port-au-Prince,
Haiti, claiming many lives and causing major damage to buildings.

9. Social Maps 175

Disaster. A United Nations patrol through the damaged suburb of Bel Air, Haiti (Jan 19 2010). 3

In the days following, a number of VGI and crowdsourcing endeavors emerged to support the
relief effort. The group Mission 4636 set up a free number to which individuals could send text
messages (SMS) to request supplies or report conditions such as people trapped beneath rubble,
infrastructure damage, and food and water shortages. The site CrowdFlower coordinated Creole and
French-speaking volunteers to translate, categorize, and geolocate over 40,000 received messages. A
group of students at Tufts University used a mapping platform known as Ushahidi to sort through the
massive influx of incoming data to identify urgent requests, as seen below. They also combined the
translated messages with information from official reports and social media to be marked as events
on a crisis map.

176 Mapping, Society, and Technology

Crisis mapping. The Ushahidi crisis map for Haiti, built by volunteers and people sending information from the site of
the disaster. 4

Texts and their crowdsourced translations were vital in responding to urgent medical and rescue
requests. The geographic and linguistic knowledge of the crowd often far exceeded resources
available to UN and US responders. In cases of aggregate need such as food and water shortages,
however, the messages were less helpful. Emergency response officials did not trust that the
incoming requests showed a complete picture of need, in part because people had to use cell phones
to report information, and there may have been areas where people did not have phones.
One very useful VGI activity during the Haiti relief effort came from contributions to Open Street
Map (OSM). OSM is an open-source map to which anyone can add or edit geographic data. At the
time the earthquake hit, existing maps of Haiti were out of date and incomplete. Volunteers from all
over the world worked to trace roads and buildings from high-resolution satellite imagery. Within a
few days, the crowdsourced map was the most detailed available, as seen below. The United Nations,
the World Bank, and search-and-rescue teams quickly adopted it for their work. Crisis maps and
OSM have been used during other natural disasters, including Typhoon Haiyan, and the mapping
projects are also being done in areas likely to have severe weather or geologic events.

volunteers can create new data and maps. 5

9.1.3 VGI for Government
Many local governments are using VGI to monitor traffic patterns, plan new bike routes, and interact
with citizens. One example of this move towards using ordinary people’s observations to improve
urban spaces is SeeClickFix. Using this application, individuals are able to report issues they see
around their neighborhood such as street light malfunctions, graffiti, or abandoned vehicles, per the
figure below. You can select the location of the issue you are reporting and it will appear on a
map with concerns posted by other users. City officials monitor these posts and pass the report to
road maintenance, police, or another relevant government department. You can also post photos of
problems and signal support for issues reported by other people. In some ways, these systems are
more transparent than calling a city to file a complaint – everyone can see the unresolved cases on
the map. This can be a problem for city staff, though, if they are unable to respond quickly or if the
person submitting the request is not satisfied with the fix.

9.2 Neogeography
In addition to expanding the number of people who can create data, shifts in technology have also
made it easier to make maps without special training. There are a number of user-friendly online and
open-source mapping tools and many government and nonprofit organizations that make their data
freely available. This trend has been described as a “democratization” of mapping practice, since the
public is actively encouraged to participate in describing the world.

9. Social Maps 179

Advocates for this “new geography” or neogeography argue that it takes the power to choose how
the world is represented out of the hands of the military, government, and academics. Amateur and
self-trained neogeographers combine already-existing online tools and data to share information with
friends or create a useful synthesis tool. For example, they might use Google Maps to “mash up” data
from several sources, make a story map of a recent vacation using geotagged photos and social media
posts, or map the movements of famous fictional characters, as below. By putting data and mapping
tools into a more diverse set of hands, a wider range of experiences and concerns become visible.

classic novel The Grapes of Wrath. 7

Some traditionally trained geographers and cartographers have questioned the quality or accuracy of
the resulting maps. This guide has spent dozens of pages discussing mapping principles, and only
skimmed the surface of cartographic method. With today’s technology anyone can make a map, but
they may not understand the underlying data, appropriate symbolization choices, or how to handle
the “lies” maps inevitably tell.

180 Mapping, Society, and Technology

9.3 Digital Divides
While there are many new possibilities for mapping, there are also huge disparities in terms of who
has the technology, skills, and time to create data and maps. The “digital divide” between those who
have access to technology and those who don’t is evident at multiple scales. Wealthy countries like
the United States have faster, cheaper internet service, more comprehensive access to computers, and
more resources devoted to the creation of geospatial data than developing nations. It is estimated
that up to a quarter of the world’s population does not have access to electric power, much less the
technology necessary to generate digital data or maps about their experiences.

Digital divide. Map of the cost of broadband subscription as a percentage of average yearly income. 8

This digital divide has resulted in a large discrepancy in the quantity and quality of data created
for different parts of the world (e.g., lower spatial and attribute resolution in poorer countries.) This
also means that international organizations continue to have more influence in shaping maps and
narratives about developing countries than the people who live there.
The digital divide is also evident over smaller areas within wealthy countries and cities. There are
strong differences in the speed of internet connections and use of new map technology between urban
and rural areas. There are also notable divides in the use of technology based on socioeconomic and
demographic characteristics. Who owns smartphones or other devices that leave a digital footprint?
Who has the time and resources to volunteer geographic information? Unsurprisingly, data is more
often produced by citizens from wealthy, tech-savvy urban neighborhoods than from poor, rural
places. This results in inconsistent accuracy in data for different places on the map. In sum, just

9. Social Maps 181

because new technology provides the possibility for more widespread participation in mapping, that
does not guarantee that this participation will be equitable without appropriate technologies and the
existence of supportive social, economic, and political institutions.

9.3.1 E-Waste
With rapid changes in new technology, the lifetime of electronic products is often very short. Cell
phone and computer companies encourage customers to trade in their devices for newer models
every couple of years or even yearly. Hundreds of millions of used computers, monitors, TVs, mobile
phones, and other electrical products are thrown away annually. An estimated 50 million tons of
electronic waste (also known as e-waste) were generated worldwide in 2012 alone (Vidal 2013).
Electronic components frequently contain hazardous substances such as lead, mercury, and cadmium
and must be disposed of carefully to avoid negative environmental consequences. So what happens
to all of these used and broken electronics?
Trade agreements, such as the Basel Convention (1989), attempt to restrict the flow of e-waste from
country to country. There are many loopholes however, and a thriving black market has developed
in some locations. Indeed, border agents checking shipping containers leaving the European Union
found that almost one in three contained illegal e-waste. Waste has become particularly concentrated
at ports in the developing world such as Guiyu, China, and Agbogbloshie, Ghana. Impoverished
individuals in these places have become experts at pulling apart electronic circuitry in order to sell
the most valuable components, as seen below. Many techniques for disassembling electronics, such
as burning plastics casings to get to the recyclable metals, have serious health effects.

9.4 Digital Maps, Real world
Digital maps shape the way that we move through and think about space. Most of the time this is
very helpful, as when we use phones to navigate from one place to another. Digital maps are also
increasingly used to help guide us to specific kinds of destinations, such as the nearest gas station or

9. Social Maps 183

coffee shop, as well as to provide information such as open hours or reviews. There can be downsides
to these very helpful technologies, however!
GPS-enabled devices have become vital to the way we navigate from place to place. With the help
of a smartphone you can arrive in a new city and, without knowing anything about the area, find
your hotel or locate a popular restaurant. Increasingly, people trust the route planning algorithms
embedded in online maps rather than their own knowledge of an area or paper maps. There are
many examples of obedient drivers following flawed directions from their GPS units into dangerous
situations, including driving into lakes, onto airport runways, or on roads not suitable for the size of
their vehicle. While you might urge individuals to pay more attention to their physical surroundings,
it is undeniable that the internet, our phones, and Google Maps mediate our movements through
space. An estimated one billion people use Google Maps every month. We are increasingly reliant
on GPS to help us get from one activity to another. In one study in England, four out of five 18- to
30-year-olds confessed to an inability to navigate without electronic help (Ward 2013).
Google and other search engine listings impact where we choose to shop, eat, and spend our free
time. When trying to find the nearest restaurant or get information about a business, many people turn
to Google maps. So where does Google get its data? The bulk of the information in Google Places
(Google’s business directory) comes from commercial mailing list databases, but ordinary users can
also edit details such as phone number or hours of operation. This means rival companies can spam
or hack a listing if it is not actively maintained by the real business owners.
An example of how someone can modify online directories is demonstrated by the fate of the Serbian
Crown, a restaurant serving hearty Serbian fare for 40 years at the same location. The restaurant was
forced to close in 2013 after seeing a sudden 75% decline in customers on the weekends (Poulson
2014). The puzzled owner eventually discovered that Google Places had been changed to incorrectly
report the store as closed on Saturdays, Sundays, and Mondays. This service allows anyone with a
Google email address to modify the information about a real place. Most of the time this is helpful
because anyone can correct an error, but sometimes this functionality can harm real people. Google
has gotten better at monitoring the so-called “community edits,” but still has trouble tracking fake
map listings.

9.5 Conclusion
Rapid changes in technology have greatly expanded who is able to create data and maps. These
changes hold exciting possibilities for scientific research, disaster relief, government practices, social
justice, and representing/navigating daily life. But it is also important to acknowledge that the
benefits of these innovations are not equally dispersed. Large portions of the global population do
not have consistent access to electricity, much less the kinds of spatial data and technology discussed

184 Mapping, Society, and Technology

in this chapter. Maps have a profound impact on the ways we move through the world and perceive
space. As we have discussed in this chapter, mapping technology has changed significantly over time,
with both positive results, like greater participation in data creation, and negative ramifications, like
the ‘digital divide.’

10. Conclusion
Steven Manson

Mapping is central to many things we do as individuals and as groups. Throughout this book, we’ve
seen the ways in which people have used maps for thousands of years, and indeed, it’s likely that
they were using maps in times before we had evidence in the form of clay tablets or wall drawings.
Today, mapping is a large and growing sector of the economy as well as an important social, cultural,
and political phenomena. Mapping is also important to lifelong learning. Spatial thinking skills are
used in many fields, careers, and pastimes. The National Research Council report “Learning to Think
Spatially” emphasizes that “with advances in computing technologies and the increasing availability
of spatial data, spatial thinking will play a significant role in the information-based economy of the
twenty-first century.” Mapping and related technologies and societal practices are the foundation of
spatial thinking.

186 Mapping, Society, and Technology

Learning to Think Spatially. The National Research Council report “Learning to Think Spatially” describes how
mapping is central to the information-based economy of the twenty-first century. 1

We’ve seen how scholars, policy makers, students, workers, and others have employed spatial
approaches that recognize the spatiotemporal nature of people, places, and processes. Key to these
efforts is using concepts such as location, space, scale, and distance. This work is all part of a broader
and vital cross-cutting need for society to broaden and deepen the use of spatial approaches so that we
may better see the connections within and among the various challenges and possibilities that people

10: Conclusion 187

and the environment face. Mapping technologies have always exemplified the interplay between
society and technology, but these social and technological components are increasingly inseparable
when they come together in mapping.
Maps are useful in part because they allow us to see large areas of the world that we otherwise
wouldn’t be able to see on our own, whether it be the bus lines on the next block or the entirety of
the earth. Maps are helpful because they can present a variety of complex social and environmental
information in a way that is easy to interpret. Maps can demonstrate basic spatial relationships
and highlight features of interest, but they can also provide information on things that cannot be
directly observed even if one were standing in the mapped location. For instance, maps allow us to
‘see’ invisible phenomena such as mineral deposits below the ground, pollutants in the air, and the
day’s pollen count. Many of our maps are reference maps, generalist views depicting one world that
essentially stores and displays a variety of features for a variety of uses. In contrast, thematic maps
highlight specific themes, be it the fastest route to work or the best places to eat.
More broadly, we have seen how maps are both a technology—be it pen on paper or pixels on a
screen—and an artifact of society derived from the data, analysis, display, and use to which maps are
put. As such, it is hard to know what the future holds. Our maps today reflect artistic and scientific
standards that are centuries old, such as the underlying projection systems or color conventions
used by most online and mobile maps. Like the societies from which they spring, however, maps
both drive and are driven by changes in society and technology. Clearly, mapping today is a story
of geographic information science and cognate technologies, like GPS, big data, virtual reality, or
machine learning. Mapping will remain an important part of this larger evolving mix of society and
technology.
What will not change, however, is the need to see maps explicitly in terms of society and technology.
Mapping is a way of knowing and changing the world, and as such, mapping can only make sense
in the context of a broader education that allows a person to critically and ethically engage with
its various dimensions. We have seen how mapping is built on various fundamentals including
data, symbolization, simplification and classification, as well as many forms of spatial analysis.
Throughout this book, we have explored the numerous scientific and policy dimensions of maps,
particularly in how there is no such thing as just data or maps outside of a broader social and
technological context. Even the most basic aspects of science and engineering of mapping
technologies pose various kinds of promises and pitfalls, including foundational technologies like
GPS, the internet, remote sensing, and crowdsourcing. Many mapping technologies, including
satellite imaging, GPS units, and the location-aware internet are grounded in a complicated set of
interplays among various parts of society, including the government, military, commercial firms, notfor-profit organizations, and regular people going about their lives.
It will also remain important to examine the continuing roles that individuals play in their cultural,
social, economic, and political worlds as it relates to mapping. We must ask questions about what

188 Mapping, Society, and Technology

surveillance practices mean for individuals and society or how individuals can take advantage
of mobile mapping technologies to change the way they understand and effect change in the
world. Mapping offers a multidisciplinary framework with which to understand a range of local,
national, and global issues. Mapping also involves critically evaluating maps produced by different
individuals, social groups and researchers. This informed understanding of these social and
technological features of mapping is more important now than ever. We have seen how individuals
and groups are tracked via their mobile phones by companies like Facebook or by government
agencies. If you are reading this book via the internet or as a download on your phone or tablet, you
are being tracked by a few different organizations, and likely more than you would expect. Mapping
is a useful way to understand relationships between society and technology, as mapping technologies
are driven by social needs and these technologies, in turn, advance and change with societal shifts.
In sum, mapping is an essential and ever-growing human activity. It is the result of the interplay
among many facets of society and technology, and has been for most of recorded history (and likely
before then as well). With the advent of computerized mapping, people experience how spatial data,
analysis, visualization and thinking are transforming our society in many ways. Billions of people use
technologies such as GPS, mapping, location-based restaurant service, and car hailing companies.
Governments use mapping to identify crime hot-spots, plan social interventions, and identify routes
to evacuate vulnerable populations from harm. Companies use spatial analysis to find optimal sites
for stores, evaluate supply chains, and determine how much to charge for goods and services. We
combine spatial approaches with spatiotemporal data gleaned from maps, satellites, smartphones,
sensor networks, drone-based cameras, and social media. These technologies help commuters plan
how to minimize travel time, farmers to best plant and protect crops, epidemiologists to identify
emerging disease hotspots; emergency planners to develop smarter evacuation routes, policy makers
to visualize spatiotemporal climate-change scenarios, and first responders to use high-resolution
imagery to map areas of need. These are just a few of the many high-impact and relevant ways in
which mapping is used in people’s lives.
