Introduction to Personality

When you rst think of personality, what comes to mind?

When we refer to certain people as being

personalities, we usually mean they are famous, people like movie stars or your favorite band. When we
describe a person as having lots of personality, we usually mean they are outgoing and fun-loving, the kind
of person we like to spend time with.

But does this tell us anything about personality itself ?

Although

we may think we have an understanding of what personality is, professional psychologists always seek to
move beyond what people think they know in order to determine what is actually real or at least as close to
real as we can come. In the pursuit of truly understanding personality, however, many personality theorists
seem to have been focused on a particularly Western cultural approach that owes much of its history to the
pioneering work of Sigmund Freud.
Freud trained as a physician with a strong background in biomedical research.

He naturally brought

his keen sense of observation, a characteristic of any good scientist, into his psychiatric practice.

As he

worked with his patients, he developed a distinctly medical model: identify a problem, identify the cause
of the problem, and treat the patient accordingly. This approach can work quite well, and it has worked
wonderfully for medical science, but it has two main weaknesses when applied to the study of personality.
First, it fails to address the complexity and uniqueness of individuals, and second, it does not readily lend
itself to describing how one chooses to develop a healthy personality.

The diversity that is the human experience can be seen in the faces of the people around us.
Quite soon in the history of personality theory, however, there were inuential theorists who began to
challenge Freud's perspective.

Alfred Adler, although a colleague of Freud's for a time, began to focus

on social interest and an individual's style of life.

Karen Horney challenged Freud's perspective on the

psychology of women, only to later suggest that the issue was more directly related to the oppression of
women as a minority, rather than a fundamental dierence based on gender.

And there were Carl Jung

and Carl Rogers, two men profoundly inuenced by Eastern philosophy. Consequently, anyone inuenced
by Jung or Rogers has also been inuenced, in part, by Eastern philosophy.

What about the rest of the

Have we taken into account the possibility that there are other, equally valuable and interesting

perspectives on the nature of people? Many elds in psychology have made a concerted eort to address
cross-cultural issues.

The primary purpose of this textbook is to address some of these dierent cultural

perspectives, and to compare them to, and contrast them with, the traditional Western perspectives.

In

addition, we will examine the relationships between the traditional approaches as well. In particular, the
nal section of this book introduces a number of paths developed throughout history to help people choose
how to live their lives. Although each path is intimately identied with a religious perspective, the paths
themselves represent more of a style of life. As we examine these perspectives, you will see that they are
all quite similar in their essential elements, making it clear that the principles involved transcend religious
culture. My hope is that when you have read this book, you will have a broad understanding of the eld of
personality, and an appreciation for both what we have in common and what makes us unique, as members
of our global community.

1.1 Denitions and Descriptions of Personality
It would seem to make sense that we should begin our study of personality by dening the term. Unfortunately, there is no single denition that ts the variety of theories that have been developed in the eld
of personality research.

Most psychologists agree that the term personality comes from the Latin word

persona, a term referring to the masks worn by actors performing ancient Greek plays. Often there were
not enough actors available to play all of the roles in a play, so they would wear these masks to let the
audience know that they were playing dierent roles. But are our personalities just masks? Freud certainly
considered the unconscious mind to be very important, Cattell considered source traits to be more important
than surface traits, and Buddhists consider the natural world (including the self ) to be an illusion. Adler
believed the best way to examine personality is to look at the person's style of life, and Rogers felt that the
only person who could truly understand you is yourself. What denition could possibly encompass all that?
Still, we need a working denition as a starting point for discussion. Borrowing loosely from Allport's
denition of personality, personality can be viewed as the dynamic organization within an individual of
various psychological factors that determines the person's characteristic thoughts and behaviors. In simpler
terms, a variety of factors blend together to create each person, and as a result of those factors the individual is
most likely to think and act in somewhat predictable ways. However, given the complexity of human life, those
predictions may prove to be elusive. Theodore Millon (1996, 2004; Millon & Grossman, 2005), a renowned
clinician and theorist in the eld of personality disorders, has sought a denition of personality broad enough
to encompass both normal and abnormal personality. Millon describes the modern view of personality as a
complex pattern of psychological characteristics that are deeply embedded, largely unconscious, and resistant
to change. These intrinsic and pervasive traits arise from a complex matrix of biological dispositions and
experiential learning, and express themselves automatically in nearly every aspect of the individual's unique
pattern of perceiving, feeling, thinking, coping, and behaving (e.g., Millon, 1996).
Another challenge we face in dening personality is how we approach the question in the rst place.

nomothetic perspective
idiographic perspective. The nomothetic perspective seeks to identify general rules that pertain
to personality as a construct (a working hypothesis or concept used to identify something we can describe

Traditionally, there have been two basic approaches to the study of personality: the
and the

but not see, such as IQ or the self ).

Thus, it can be rather abstract, and often fails to appreciate the

uniqueness of individuals. In contrast, the idiographic perspective focuses specically on the individuality
and uniqueness of each person. Although the idiographic approach often seems more appealing to students,
especially since it enhances their self-esteem by considering them as individually important, it is dicult
for any theory of personality to encompass research that treats only one person at a time. Such a theory
would naturally suer from problems of generalizability, and may be useful for therapists working with one
patient or client at a time, but it will not be particularly useful for enhancing our overall understanding of
personality in general. It is important to note, however, that many early personality theories were based on
individual case studies, and this critique is one that we will see several times in this book.
As is often the case in psychology, the best approach may be to attempt blending the nomothetic and
idiographic perspectives, seeking the generalizability of the nomothetic perspective's general principles on
personality and personality development - while maintaining an appreciation for the idiographic perspective's
recognition of the value of an individual's unique character. Millon (1996) suggests an integrative approach
to dening personality.

Not only would an integrative approach combine the nomothetic and idiographic

perspectives, it would also help to bring together the two broad traditions of clinical and applied psychology.
Clinical psychologists are compelled by the nature of their work with patients, or clients, to try to understand
the individual. Thus, they need to follow a more idiographic approach. In contrast, applied psychologists
(e.g., experimental psychologists) are more construct-focused, and nd the nomothetic approach more appealing and useful for developing generalizable theories on the nature of various aspects of personality. If
personality can be dened in a satisfactory way by an integrative approach, then clinicians may benet more
from applied research, and experimental psychologists may see their work more directly applied in clinical
settings where it may help people in our society.
In order to better understand how some of the dierent disciplines within the eld of psychology contribute
to our denition of personality, let's take a brief look at some of the widely recognized factors that come into

play:

Discussion Question: The nomothetic and idiographic perspectives approach personality in very different ways.

Do you believe that your personality can be described in a way that might also be used to

describe the personalities of other people (maybe your friends), or do you feel it is necessary to describe each
person as an individual?

Psychodynamic Factors
The very word psychodynamic suggests that there are ongoing interactions between dierent elements
of the mind. Sigmund Freud not only oered names for these elements (id, ego, and superego), he proposed
dierent levels of consciousness. Since the unconscious mind was very powerful according to Freud, one of
the rst and most enduring elements of psychodynamic theory is that we are often unaware of why we think
and act the way we do. Add to that the belief that our personality is determined in early childhood, and
you can quickly see that psychological problems would be very dicult to treat. Perhaps more importantly,
since we are not aware of many of our own thoughts and desires, it would dicult or even impossible for us
to choose to change our personality no matter how much we might want to.
Most psychodynamic theorists since Freud have expanded the inuences that aect us to include more
of the outside world.
emphasized the ego.

Those theorists who remained loyal to Freud, typically known as neo-Freudians,
Since the ego functions primarily in the real world, the individual must take into

account the inuence of other people involved in their lives. Some theorists who diered signicantly from
the traditional Freudian perspective, most notably Alfred Adler and Karen Horney, focused much of their
theories on cultural inuences. Adler believed that social cooperation was essential to the success of each
individual (and humanity as a whole), whereas Horney provided an intriguing alternative to Freud's sexist
theories regarding women. Although Horney based her theories regarding women on the cultural standing
between men and women in the Victorian era, to a large extent her theory remains relevant today.

Learning and Cognitive Factors
As a species, human beings are distinguished by their highly developed brains.

Animals with less-

developed nervous systems rely primarily on instinctive behavior, but very little on learning. While the study
of animals' instinctive behavior is fascinating, and led to a shared Nobel Prize for the ethologists Nikolaas
Tinbergen, Konrad Lorenz, and Karl von Frisch, animal behavior remains distinctly limited compared to the
complex learning and cognitive tasks that humans can readily perform (Beck, 1978; Gould, 1982). Indeed,
the profound value of our abilities to think and learn may be best reected in the fact that, according to
Tinbergen's strict denition of instinct (see Beck, 1978), humans appear not to have any instinctive behavior
anymore.

Yet we have more than made up for it through our ability to learn, and learning theory and

behaviorism became dominant forces in the early years of American psychology.
John B. Watson and B.F. Skinner are among the most famous and inuential of American psychologists.
Learning about their groundbreaking research on classical and operant conditioning is standard fare in
psychology courses. More recently, Albert Bandura has enjoyed similar popularity and respect in the eld of
social learning theory. Anyone who has children knows full well how eagerly they observe us and mimic our
actions and speech. An important aspect of the learning perspective is that our personalities may develop
as a result of the rewards and/or punishments we receive from others. Consequently, we should be able to
shape an individual's personality in any way we want. Early behaviorists, like Watson, suggested that they
could indeed take any child and raise them to be successful in any career they chose for them. Although
most parents and teachers try to be a good inuence on children, and to set good examples for them,
children are often inuenced more by their peers. What children nd rewarding may not be what parents
and teachers think is rewarding. This is why a social-cognitive approach to learning becomes very important
in understanding personality development. Social-cognitive theorists, like Bandura, recognize that children
interact with their environment, partly determining for themselves what is rewarding or punishing, and then
react to the environment in their own unique way.
As suggested by the blend of behaviorism and cognition that Bandura and others proposed, there is a
close association between behaviorism and the eld of cognitive psychology.

Although strict behaviorists

rejected the study of unobservable cognitive processes, the cognitive eld has actually followed the guidelines
of behaviorism with regard to a dispassionate and logical observation of the expression of cognitive processes

through an individual's behavior and what they say. Thus, the ability of human beings to think, reason,
analyze, anticipate, etc., leads them to act in accordance with their ideas, rather than simply on the basis of
traditional behavioral controls: reward, punishment, or associations with unconditional stimuli. The success
of the cognitive approach when applied to therapy, such as the techniques developed by Aaron Beck, has
helped to establish cognitive theory as one the most respected areas in the study of personality and abnormal
psychology.

Biological Factors
Although humans may not exhibit instinctive behavior, we are still ultimately a product of our biological
makeup, our specic DNA pattern. Our individual DNA pattern is unique, unless we happen to be an identical twin, and it not only provides the basis for our learning and cognitive abilities, it also sets the conditions
for certain aspects of our character. Perhaps the most

salient of these characteristics is temperament,

which can loosely be described as the emotional component of our personality. In addition to temperament,
twin studies have shown that all aspects of personality appear to be signicantly inuenced by our genetic
inheritance (Bouchard, 1994; Bouchard & McGue, 1990; Bouchard et al., 1990). Even such complex personality variables as well-being, traditionalism, and religiosity have been found to be highly inuenced by our
genetic make-up (Tellegen et al., 1988; Waller et al., 1990).
Sociobiologists and evolutionary psychologists also emphasize the role of genetics and adaptation over
time.

Sociobiologists consider how biological factors inuence social behavior.

For example, they would

suggest that men are inclined to prefer multiple sexual partners because men are biologically capable of
fathering many children, whereas women would be inclined to favor one successful and established partner,
because a woman must physically invest a year or more in each child (a 9-month pregnancy followed by a
period of nursing). Similarly, evolutionary psychologists consider how human behavior has been adaptive for
our survival. Humans evolved from plant-eating primates, we are not well suited to defend ourselves against
large, meat-eating predators. As a group, however, and using our intellect to fashion weapons from sticks
and rocks, we were able to survive and ourish over time. Unfortunately, the same adaptive inuences that
guide the development of each healthy person can, under adverse conditions, lead to dysfunctional behaviors,
and consequently, psychological disorders (Millon, 2004).

Discussion Question: Some research suggests that personality is largely determined by genetics. Do
you see similarities in your personality as compared to your parents, grandparents, brothers, sisters, etc.? Do
you think that your environment, things like your community, your friends, television, movies, the Internet,
etc., are more inuential than your biological inheritance from your parents?

Inherent Drives
Freud believed that we are motivated primarily by psychosexual impulses, and secondarily by our tendency toward aggression. Certainly it is necessary to procreate for the species to survive, and elements of
aggression are necessary for us to get what we need and to protect ourselves.

But this is a particularly

dark and somewhat animalistic view of humanity. The humanistic psychologists Carl Rogers and Abraham
Maslow believed in a positive view of people, they proposed that each of us contains an inherent drive to be
the best that we can be, and to accomplish all that we are capable of accomplishing. Rogers and Maslow
called this drive

self-actualization. Interestingly, this concept is actually thousands of years old, and having

spent time in China, Rogers was well aware of Buddhist and Yogic perspectives on the self.
Somewhat related to the humanistic concept of self-actualization, is the existential perspective. Existential theorists, like Rollo May, believe that individuals can be truly happy only when they nd some meaning
in life. In Eastern philosophical perspectives, coming from Yoga and Buddhism, meaning in life is found by
realizing that life is an illusion, that within each of us is the essence of one universal spirit. Indeed, Yoga
means union, referring to union with God. Thus, we have meaning within us, but the illusion of our life is
what distracts us from realizing it.

Discussion Question: Do you feel that you are driven to accomplish something great, or to nd some
particular meaning in life? Do you believe that there might be pathways to guide you, particularly spiritual
or religious pathways?

Sociocultural Inuences
Culture can broadly be dened as everything that people have, think, and do as members of a society

(Ferraro, 2006a), and appears to be as old as the

Homo

genus itself (the genus of which we, as

Homo sapiens,

are the current representatives; Haviland et al., 2005). Culture has also been described as the memory of a
society (see Triandis & Suh, 2002). Culture is both learned and shared by members of a society, and it is
what the makes the behavior of an individual understandable to other members of that culture. Everything
we do is inuenced by culture, from the food we eat to the nature of our personal relationships, and it
varies dramatically from group to group. What makes life understandable and predictable within one group
may be incomprehensible to another. Despite dierences in detail, however, there are a number of cultural
universals, those aspects of culture that have been identied in every cultural group that has been examined
historically or ethnographically (Murdock, 1945; see also Ferraro, 2006a).

Therefore, if we truly want to

understand personality theory, we need to know something about the sociocultural factors that may be the
same, or that may dier, between groups.
In 1999, Stanley Sue proposed that psychology has systematically avoided the study of cross-cultural
factors in psychological research. This was not because psychologists themselves are biased, but rather, it
was due to an inherent bias in the nature of psychological research (for commentaries see also Tebes, 2000;
Guyll & Madon, 2000; and Sue, 2000). Although some may disagree with the arguments set forth in Sue's
initial study, it is clear that the vast majority of research has been conducted here in America, primarily
by American college professors studying American psychology students.

And the history of our country

clearly identies most of those individuals, both the professors and the students, as White, middle- to upperclass men. The same year, Lee et al. (1999) brought together a collection of multicultural perspectives on
personality, with the individual chapters written by a very diverse group of authors. In both the preface
and their introductory chapter, the editors emphasize that neither human nature nor personality can be
separated from culture. And yet, as suggested by Sue (1999), they acknowledge the general lack of crosscultural or multicultural research in the eld of personality.

Times have begun to change, however.

In

2002, the American Psychological Association (APA) adopted a policy entitled Guidelines on Multicultural
Education, Training, Research, Practice, and Organizational Change for Psychologists (which is available
online at www.apa.org/pi/multiculturalguidelines/homepage.html). The year 2002 also saw a chapter in the
prestigious

Annual Review of Psychology

& Suh, 2002).

on how culture inuences the development of personality (Triandis

In a fascinating article on whether psychology actually matters in our lives, former APA

president and renowned social psychologist Philip Zimbardo (2004) identied the work of Kenneth and
Mamie Clark on prejudice and discrimination, which was presented to the United States Supreme Court
during the

Brown vs. Board of Education of Topeka, KS

case (which led to the end of school segregation

in America) as one of the most signicant impacts on American life that psychology has contributed to
directly (see also Benjamin & Crouse, 2002; Keppel, 2002; Pickren & Tomes, 2002). Finally, an examination
of

American Psychologist

(the principle journal of APA) and

Psychological Science

(the principle journal

of the American Psychological Society) since the year 2000 reveals studies demonstrating the importance of
cross-cultural research in many areas of psychology (see Table 1.1). So, although personality theorists, and
the eld of psychology in general, have been somewhat slow to address cross-cultural and diversity issues,
in more recent years psychologists appear to be rapidly gaining a greater appreciation of the importance of
studying human diversity in all its forms.
As mentioned in the opening paragraphs of this chapter, one of the primary goals of this book is to
incorporate dierent cultural perspectives into our study of personality theory, to take more of a global
perspective than has traditionally been done. Why is this important? It is actually very easy to point out
the answer to that question.

The United States of America has less than 300 million people.

India has

nearly 1 billion people, and China has over 1 billion people. So, two Asian countries alone have nearly 7
times as many people as the United States.

How can we claim to be studying personality if we haven't

taken into account the vast majority of people in the world? Of course, we haven't entirely ignored these
two particular countries, because two of the most famous personality theorists spent time in these countries
when they were young. Carl Jung spent time in India, and his theories were clearly inuenced by ancient
Vedic philosophy, and Carl Rogers spent time in China while studying to be a minister. So it is possible to
draw connections between Yoga, Buddhism, psychodynamic theory, and humanistic psychology. Sometimes
this will involve looking at dierences between cultures, and other times we will focus on similarities. At the

end of the book I hope you will appreciate not only the diversity of personality and personality theory, but
also the connections that tie all of us together.

Discussion Question: Do you notice cultural dierences around you every day, or do you live in a
small community where everyone is very much the same? What sort of challenges do you face as a result
of cultural dierences, either because you deal with them daily or because you have little opportunity to
experience them?

Some Basic Questions Common to All Areas of Personality Theory
In addition to the broad perspectives described above, there are a number of philosophical questions that
help to bring the nature of personality into perspective. Thinking about how these questions are answered
by each theory can help us to compare and contrast the dierent theories.

Is our personality inherited, or are we products of our environment?
vs.

nurture.

This is the classic debate on nature

Are we born with a given temperament, with a genetically determined style of interacting

with others, certain abilities, with various behavioral patterns that we cannot even control?

Or are we

shaped by our experiences, by learning, thinking, and relating to others? Many psychologists today nd this
debate amusing, because no matter what area of psychology you study, the answer is typically both! We
are born with a certain range of possibilities determined by our DNA. We can be a certain height, have a
certain IQ, be shy or outgoing, we might be Black, Asian, White or Hispanic, etc. because of who we are
genetically. However, the environment can have a profound eect on how our genetic make-up is realized.
For example, an abused child may become shy and withdrawn, even though genetically they were inclined
to be more outgoing.

A child whose mother abused alcohol during the pregnancy may suer from fetal

alcohol syndrome, the leading cause of preventable mental retardation, even though the child was genetically
endowed with the possibility of being a genius. So the best perspective may be that our genetic make-up
provides a range of possibilities for our life, and the environment in which we grow determines where exactly
we fall within that range.

Are we unique, or are there common types of personality?

Many students want to believe that they are

special and truly unique, and they tend to reject theories that try to categorize individuals.

However, if

personality theories were unique to each person, we could never possibly cover all of the theories! Also, as
unique as you may be, aren't many people, like your friends, similar to you? In order to understand and
compare people, personality theorists need to consider that there are common aspects of personality. It is
up to each of us to decide whether we are still willing to nd what is unique and special about each separate
person.

Which is more important, the past, present, or future?

Many theorists, particularly psychodynamic

theorists, consider personality to be largely determined at an early age. Similarly, those who believe strongly
in the genetic determination of personality would consider many factors set even before birth.

But what

prospects for growth does this allow, can people change or choose a new direction in their life? Cognitive
and behavioral theorists focus on specic thoughts, beliefs, and behaviors that are inuencing our daily lives,
whereas existential theorists search for meaning in our lives.

Other theorists, such as the humanists and

those who favor the spiritually-oriented perspectives we will examine, consider the future to be primary in
our goals and aspirations. Self-actualization is something we can work toward. Indeed, it may be an inherent
drive.

Do we have free will, or is our behavior determined?

Although this question seems similar to the previous

one, it refers more to whether we consciously choose the path we take in life as compared to whether our
behavior is specically determined by factors beyond our control. We already mentioned the possibility of
genetic factors above, but there might also be unconscious factors and stimuli in our environment. Certainly
humans rely on learning for much of what we do in life, so why not for developing our personalities? Though
some students don't want to think of themselves as simply products of reinforcement and punishment (i.e.,
operant conditioning) or the associations formed during classical conditioning (anyone have a phobia?), what
about the richness of observational learning? Still, exercising our will and making sound choices seems far
more dignied to many people. Is it possible to develop our will, to help us make better choices and follow
through on them? Yes, according to William James, America's foremost psychologist. James considered our
will to be of great importance, and he included chapters on the will in two classic books:

published in 1892 and

Talks to Teachers on Psychology and to Students on Some of Life's Ideals,

which was published in 1899. James not only thought about the importance of the will, he recommended
exercising it. In

Talks to Teachers. . .,

he sets forth the following responsibility for teachers of psychology:

But let us now close in a little more closely on this matter of the education of the will. Your task is to
build up a character in your pupils; and a character, as I have so often said, consists in an organized set of
habits of reaction. Now of what do such habits of reaction themselves consist? They consist of tendencies
to act characteristically when certain ideas possess us, and to refrain characteristically when possessed by
other ideas (p. 816).

1.2 Personality as a Discipline within the Field of Psychology
As dicult as it may be to dene personality, it is important to know something about it. Personality is
probably the most important eld in psychology.

Understanding who we are as individuals, and why we

think certain thoughts and do certain things is the starting point for addressing clinical issues, abnormal
psychology, and health psychology, it is the ultimate goal of studying human development, and it is the
point from which we begin to address social psychology. Without an appreciation of the individual, without
concern for each person, these other areas of psychology become little more than academic subjects.

Personality as a Common Thread in the History of Psychology
Most historians identify the starting point of the modern eld of psychology with the experimental
psychologists, particularly the establishment of Wilhelm Wundt's laboratory in Leipzig, Germany in 1879.
Personality theorists, however, were not far behind.

Freud, Adler, and Jung were all beginning to work

in the eld of psychiatry (they were medical doctors) in the late 1800s as well.

If one wants to put an

ocial date on the start of modern personality theory, it would most likely be 1900, the year in which Freud
published  The

Interpretation of Dreams

(Freud, 1900/1995).

Since Freud's theories were based on his

work with patients, this date is also the beginning of a relationship between personality theory, abnormal
psychology, and psychotherapy, a relationship that continues today. Early psychodynamic theorists were also
inuential in developmental psychology and school psychology. Freud began his theory of personality with
a proposed series of developmental stages: the ve psychosexual stages. Erik Erikson, another well known
psychodynamic theorist, is probably better known as a developmental psychologist for his eight-stage theory
of psychosocial crises. Adler considered the early years of childhood so important that he felt parents and
teachers should have access to training and counseling in the schools. With the endorsement of the minister
of education, Adler and his colleagues established child guidance centers in many public schools.
As psychodynamic theory dominated the European scene in the early 1900s, America was largely inuenced by behaviorism. Behavioral theorists also considered personality within their domain, suggesting
that personality is learned. John B. Watson boasted that he could use behavioral principles to direct any
child into any given career path. B.F. Skinner constructed an advanced version of his famous Skinner Box,
which was typically used to train rats or pigeons, to raise and care for children during the early years of
life. As behaviorism continued to develop, social learning theorists focused on a rich mixture of imitation,
observation of the rewards and punishment experienced by others, expectations, and personal assessment of
the value of potential rewards and punishers.
Against this backdrop of psychodynamic theory and behaviorism, Rogers and Maslow became the leading
advocates of a new and openly positive view of human development, referred to most commonly as humanistic

psychology. This new eld emphasized self-actualization, though self-actualization itself does not appear to
have been a new concept. It closely resembles the enlightenment described by Yoga and Buddhism (each
of which is thousands of years old), though Yoga and Buddhism ultimately reject the existence of the self.
Is there a relationship between Eastern philosophical perspectives and humanistic psychology? Rogers had
traveled throughout Asia, particularly in China, and Maslow had studied with renowned psychodynamic
theorists who were fascinated by Buddhism (such as Horney), so both were well acquainted with the basics
of Eastern philosophical thought.
Closely related to the behavioral perspectives, cognitive theories of personality are also prominent in
psychology.

Today, the use of non-invasive brain imaging techniques (e.g., functional magnetic resonance

imaging), which function in real time, have made the study of cognitive processes one of the most exciting
areas of psychological research.

Studying cognition is hardly new, however, since the earliest studies of

consciousness can be traced to William James in the late 1800s. Still, what James was able to study over
100 years ago is completely dierent than what modern cognitive neuroscientists are able to study today.
Nonetheless, if we can nd something in common between the studies of over a century ago and the research
of today, perhaps we will really begin to understand the complexity and diversity of personality.

Positive Psychology and Spirituality: New Directions in the Field of Personality

Figure 1.2

Young children enjoy helping even younger children. Positive psychology encourages us all to study and
promote such behavior.
In 1998, Martin Seligman, then president of APA and author of What You Can Change & What You
Can't (1994), urged psychologists to rediscover the forgotten mission of psychology: to build human strength
and nurture genius. Seligman called this new area Positive Psychology (for thorough overviews see Compton,
2005 or Peterson, 2006). In 2000,

American Psychologist published a special edition on happiness, excellence,
Psychologist, Vol. 55, Number 1, 2000; with an introduction by

and optimal human functioning (American
Seligman & Csikszentmihalyi, 2000).

The general goal of positive psychology is to nd ways in which

psychological research can help people to be happier, and to lead more fullling lives. Positive psychology
can also serve as a focus for psychologists to become more appreciative of not only human nature, but also of

the potential for the eld of psychology itself to benet all people (Sheldon & King, 2001). Table 1.3 oers
a sampling of the wide range of interest in positive psychology that exists today.
Closely related to positive psychology is the concept of resilience.

Many individuals face dicult or

traumatic challenges in life, and yet some manage to maintain stability in their lives in spite of these
unfortunate circumstances. How exactly these individuals maintain stability and a positive direction in their
lives is not always clear, and there may be a variety of dierent ways that individuals respond to such
extreme stress (Bonanno, 2004, 2005a; Masten, 2001; for commentary on the rst article see also Bonanno,
2005b; Kelley, 2005; Linley & Joseph, 2005; Litz, 2005; Maddi, 2005; Roisman, 2005). Among the important
factors, particularly for our perspective here, is the ability to maintain positive emotions and to pursue selfenhancement (Bonanno, 2004, 2005; Masten, 2001). Throughout history, a variety of cultures have given rise
to spiritual pursuits that help to guide the development of individuals in positive directions. We will cover
some of these spiritual paths in the last section of this book, taking just a brief look here at the relationship
between spirituality, positive psychology, and personality.

It appears that spirituality is an essential attribute of human nature. It has been recognized for some
time that religious ritual is a cultural universal (Murdock, 1945; see also Ferraro, 2006a). More than simply a
cultural universal, however, spirituality appears to be a natural consequence of child development. Deborah

Kelemen (2004) brought together a number of dierent theories, and was able to demonstrate that young
children, around
the age of 5 years old, have both the ability and the inclination to explain the world around them in
terms of an intentional act by a supernatural being. Thus, Kelemen suggests that young children are what
she calls intuitive theists. Surprisingly, this tendency appears to continue into adulthood, since even college
students studying evolution exhibit a tendency to think of evolution as a purposeful agent itself, an agent
that guides further evolution according to a thoughtful plan (Kelemen, 2004).
The relationship between psychology and religious/spiritual pursuits has a long and interesting history.
One of William James' most famous books is

Nature

The Varieties of Religious Experience: A Study in Human

(James, 1902/1987), and around the turn of the century in 1900 psychologists of the day actually used

religion in the popular press to help engender respect for the new eld of psychology (Pickren, 2000). Since
the more recent turn of the century there have been a number of books and articles published connecting
psychology, spirituality, religion, and psychotherapy (see Table 1.4).

Thus, a topic that was viewed as

important at the beginning of the eld of psychology, but was then pushed aside as unscientic, is once again
become an area of interest and importance. Although spirituality is certainly not synonymous with positive
psychology, it does appear to be an important factor in positive psychology.

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION TO PERSONALITY

Numerous studies have shown that individuals who are actively spiritual have higher levels of wellbeing and fewer serious problems in their lives (see Compton, 2005; Myers, 2000; Seligman, 2002; Seligman
& Csikszentmihalyi, 2000).

The recently published

Handbook of Positive Psychology

has two chapters

devoted specically to spiritual pursuits and their benets (Pargament & Mahoney, 2005; Shapiro et al.,
2005). Peterson and Seligman (2004) have identied spirituality as one of the twenty-four specic character
strengths that have consistently emerged across history and culture. Indeed, they believe that spirituality
is the most human of the character strengths as well as the most sublime. . .People with this strength have a
theory about the ultimate meaning of life that shapes their conduct and provides comfort to them (pg. 533;
Peterson & Seligman, 2004). In the last section of this book we will examine a number of spiritual approaches
to life, each of which suggests a path for positive development. Despite being associated with very dierent
religions, which range from 1,400 years old to perhaps more than 5,000 years old, these spiritual paths have
much in common. Perhaps this should not be surprising, as it may help to explain the inherent nature of
children to be intuitive theists and the universality of religious ritual in human culture.

Discussion Question: Do you believe that psychology should work to develop itself as a eld that
focuses on helping people to develop in positive ways? Can spirituality or religion be helpful, or might they
present more problems?

1.3 Methods of Studying Personality
In all types of research, we need to consider two closely related concepts:

hypothesis vs. theory. An

hypothesis can loosely be dened as an educated guess about some relationship or circumstance that we
have observed, and the purpose of the hypothesis is to explain what we have experienced and to provide a
starting point for further research. When a set of observations seems to come together, especially as the result
of testing our hypotheses, we might then propose a theory to bring those observations together. However,
a theory is not necessarily our end point, since the theory itself may generate new hypotheses and more
research. In this way, all scientic endeavors continue to develop, expand, clarify, change, whatever the case
may be, over time. As a result, we have many dierent personality theories, since dierent theorists have
viewed the human condition dierently, and they have also used dierent techniques to study personality.
A variety of methods have been used to study personality. Much of the early research was based on clinical
observations, which were not done according to strict experimental methods. Today, ethical restrictions on
the types of research we can conduct with people limit our ability to re-evaluate many of those classic studies.
So we are left with a eld that is rich in theory, but somewhat poor in the validation of those theories. Of
course some personality theorists have approached personality in a more scientic manner, or at least they
have tried, but that has limited the questions they have been able to ask.

Since a detailed analysis of

experimental psychology and research design is beyond the scope of this textbook, we will only cover this
topic briey (though it may come up again within individual chapters).

Case Studies
Many of the best-known personality theorists relied on case studies to develop their theories. Indeed, it
was after seeing a number of patients with seemingly impossible neurological complaints that Freud began
to seek an explanation of psychological disorders.

Basically, the case study approach relies on a detailed

analysis of interesting and unique individuals. Because these individuals are unique, the primary criticism
of the case study approach is that its results may not generalize to other people.

Of greater concern, is

the possibility that early theorists chose to report only those cases that seemed to support their theories, or
perhaps they only recognized those elements of a patient's personality that t their theory? Another problem,
as mentioned above, is that two dierent theorists might view the same cases in very dierent ways. For
example, since Carl Rogers worked initially with children, he found it dicult to accept Freud's suggestions
that even children were motivated primarily by sexual and aggressive urges. Consequently, Rogers sought a
more positive view of personality development, which led to the establishment of the humanistic perspective.
Thus, the case study approach can lead to very dierent conclusions depending on one's own perspective
while conducting research. In other words, it can easily be more subjective than objective, and psychologists
who focus on our eld as a scientic discipline always strive for more objective research.

Correlational Designs
When conducting correlational research psychologists examine the relationships that exist between variThe measure that is typically used is the correlation
coecient, which can range from 1.0 to 0.0 to +1.0. A value close to zero suggests that there is no
ables, but they do not control those variables.

relationship between the variables, whereas a value closer to 1.0 or +1.0 suggests a strong relationship,
with the direction of the relationship determining whether the value is positive or negative. It is important
to remember that the strength of the correlation is determined by how far the correlation coecient is from
zero, not whether it is positive or negative. For example, we would most likely nd a positive correlation
between the number of hours you study for a test and the number of correct answers you get (i.e., the more
you study, the more questions you get right on the test). On the other hand, the exact same data will give
us a negative correlation if we compare the number of hours you study to the number of questions you get
wrong (i.e., the more you study, they fewer questions you get wrong).

So the way in which you ask the

question can determine whether you have a positive or negative correlation, but it should not aect the
strength of the relationship.
Since the investigator does not control the variables in correlational research, it is not possible to determine
whether or not one variable causes the relationship.

In the example used above, it certainly seems that

studying more would lead to getting a better grade on a test. But consider another example: can money
buy happiness? There is some evidence that wealthy people are happier than the average person, and that
people in wealthy countries are happier than those in poorer countries. But does the money aect happiness?
Certainly a million dollars in cash wouldn't help much if you were stranded on a desert island, so what can it
do for you at home? People with money can live in nicer, safer communities, they have access to better health
care (so they may feel better physically), they may have more time to spend with their family and friends,
and so in many ways their lives might be dierent. We can also look at the correlation the other way around;
maybe happy people get more money. If you ran a company, and were going to hire or promote someone,
wouldn't you want to nd someone who is friendly and outgoing? Wouldn't you look for someone who other
people will enjoy working with? So, maybe happy people do nd it easier to be successful nancially. Either
way, we simply can't be sure about which variable inuences the other, or even if they inuence each other
at all. In order to do that, we must pursue experimental research.

Figure 1.3

In these gures, adapted from research conducted by the author (Kelland et al., 1989), we see two
correlations reported in an actual study. In the gure on the left, we can see a signicant positive correlation
between the ring rate of dopamine neurons in the rat brain and the dose of the drug quinpirole needed
to inhibit those cells. In the gure on the right, we can see that the correlation is eliminated (the dose of

quinpirole needed is not related to the ring rate of the cell) following administration of the drug MDMA
(more commonly known as Ecstasy!).
Experimental and Quasi-Experimental Designs
The experimental design is usually preferred within psychology, as with any other science. The goal is to
control every aspect of the experiment and then manipulate a single variable, thus allowing us to attribute
the results to that single manipulation. As a result, experiments allow us to make cause-and-eect statements
about the relationships between the variables.

in a random fashion, and assign them randomly to a control group and an experimental group. The
A simple experiment begins with dening the

lated, and the

experimental group is then exposed to the independent variable, whereas the control group is not.

If we

have successfully controlled all other variables through random selection of subjects (i.e., all subjects in a
specied population have an equal chance of being selected for the study) and random assignment to the
control and experimental groups (so that hopefully each group has an equal representation of gender, races,
age, intelligence, personal habits, etc.), we should see a dierence in the dependent variable that was caused
by the independent variable.
Unlike the natural sciences, however, we can seldom control human behavior in the precise ways that true
experimental designs require. For example, if we want to study the eects of prenatal exposure to cocaine
on personality development, we certainly cannot ask pregnant women to use cocaine. Unfortunately, there
are pregnant women who abuse cocaine and other illegal drugs.

Therefore, we can try to identify those

women, and subsequently study the development of their children. Since a variety of other factors led these
women to abuse illegal drugs, we lose the control that is desired in an experiment. Such studies are called
quasi-experimental, because they are set up

as if

we did an experiment, and can be analyzed in similar

ways. The quasi-experimental approach has many applications, and can provide valuable information not
available otherwise, so long as the investigators keep in mind the limitations of the technique (for the classic
discussion of this design see Campbell & Stanley, 1963).

Case Studies

Focus is on a detailed examination of unique and interesting cases. May provide a great

deal of information, but due to the individual nature of the case that information may not generalize to
others.
Correlational Designs

Focus is on how variables change in relation to each other. However, since there

is no control over that change, we cannot determine whether one variable aects the other, or vice versa, or
even if the change is due to some unidentied outside factor.
Experiments

Experiments are usually the preferred type of research, since the control exerted over the

variables involved allows the investigator to make cause-and-eect statements about the results obtained.
However, ethical considerations often make experimental research with humans unacceptable.
Quasi-Experiments When individuals choose to put themselves in situations that psychologists could not
ethically create, a situation arises in which the consequences can be studied

as if

an experiment was done.

These are not true experiments, however, since the investigator cannot be sure of all the variables that led
the individuals to put themselves in such situations to begin with.
Cross-Cultural andMulticultural Research

In an eort to control the conditions of their research, psy-

chologists try to work with clearly dened groups. Unfortunately, that means their results may not generalize
to other groups of people. Cross-cultural and multicultural psychologists remind us that, in a truly global
world, we must strive to address both the dierences and the similarities that characterize human nature.

Table 1.5

Cross-Cultural Approaches to the Study of Personality
Cross-cultural approaches to studying personality do not really represent a dierent type of research, but
rather an approach to research that does not assume all people are inuenced equally by the same factors.
More importantly, cross-cultural psychologists recognize that seemingly common factors may, in reality, be
quite dierent when viewed by people of very dierent cultures.

The most obvious problem that arises

when considering these issues is the potential dierence between cross-cultural and multicultural research.
Cross-cultural research is based on a comparison of cultures; two well-known categorizations are Eastern vs.
Western perspectives and the somewhat related topic of individualistic vs. collectivistic cultures. However,
a multicultural approach tells us that we must consider the true complexity of the human race. What is
Eastern, is it Asia, China, Japan, does it include India, and what about Muslim groups of people? Should
Buddhism be viewed as an Eastern perspective or a religious perspective? This book will address a variety of
spiritual paths toward positive psychological development, but none of the associated religions are indigenous
to Africa, so will our discussions be complete? The list goes on and on, because there are so many dierent
cultures in the world. And nally, is it practical to really try coming up with a theory of personality that can
encompass all the dierent groups of people throughout the world? Only by pursuing an understanding of
dierent cultures can psychology truly be considered a global science, and that pursuit has only just begun.
Since we have a long way to go, the future is ripe for new students to pursue careers in psychology and the
study of personality.

Discussion Question: Do you consider psychology to be a science? Has psychology successfully applied
the scientic method to the study of mind and behavior, particularly the study of personality and personality
development?

1.4 Application of Personality Theory - Assessing Personality
As in the section above on research methods, an extensive discussion of personality assessment is beyond
the scope of this textbook. However, this is such an important issue that we will look at it briey here, and
then will take a closer look in some of the chapters throughout the rest of the book. There are a number of
excellent handbooks available on psychological assessment (e.g., Goldstein & Hersen, 1990; Groth-Marnat,
2003), including two that focus on cross-cultural and multicultural assessment (Dana, 2000; Suzuki et al.,
2001).
Personality assessment most commonly occurs in a clinical setting, when an individual is seeking help for
some problem, whether it is an adjustment disorder or a potential mental illness. Assessing personality goes
beyond this singular role, however. Certainly a clinical psychologist would be using personality assessment in
order to understand a patient's symptoms, provide a diagnosis (if appropriate), and recommend a preferred
course of therapy. Similarly, school psychologists use assessment to identify any possible learning disorders
and/or adjustment issues as they pertain to the educational environment.

But other psychologists use

personality assessment for a variety of reasons as well. Industrial/organizational psychologists use personality
assessment to identify preferred candidates for particular jobs, career counselors use these assessments in

25

order to provide valid recommendations regarding the choice of a career path, and research psychologists
use assessment in their ongoing eorts to correlate certain personality types to observable behavior or other
measures. Thus, the assessment tools used to describe and/or understand personality have a wide range of
potential applications.

Reliability, Validity, and Standardization
A particular personality assessment is of little value if it has no reliability or validity and if it is not

manner in which a test is given, which must be the same for every person receiving the test if there is to be
any value in comparing the results among dierent people.
Determining the reliability and validity of a test can be a long and complicated process, involving a
variety of statistical methods to conrm the results. During this process the psychologist(s) developing the
test will also typically establish norms.

Norms are consistent ways in which particular groups score on a

test. For example, on measures of aggressiveness the "normal" level for men may be quite dierent than
the "normal" level for women. Standardization is quite a bit simpler to establish, since the test can include
precise instructions dictating the manner in which it is to be given.

Assessing Personality with Objective Tests
The most famous self-report inventory is the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (or
MMPI). The MMPI is also probably the most widely used psychological test in the world, and it has stood
the test of time (it is currently in its second version, a 1989 revision of the 1943 original). The current version
consists of 567 true-false questions, which address not only normal personality traits, but psychopathology
and the accuracy of the test-taker as well. The test has several built in "lie" scales, in case a person were
trying to fake a mental illness (e.g., if they were trying to fake an insanity defense to avoid responsibility
for a crime) or minimize any symptoms they may actually be experiencing. The questions themselves range
from rather simple (e.g., I enjoy drama.) to rather strange (e.g., I am a prophet of God.), but when put all
together they provide a highly valid assessment that can easily be scored by computer (hence the popularity
of the test, for both reasons). NOTE: Those are not actual questions from the MMPI, but they are based
on real questions. The MMPI is an empirically based instrument. That is, interpretations are based on the
pattern of responding obtained by various psychiatric samples. Since the standard MMPI was developed for
adults and is rather lengthy, an abbreviated version was developed for use with adolescents: the MMPI-A.
A number of alternatives to the MMPI have been developed. The California Psychological Inventory has
been available almost as long as the MMPI and, more recently, the Personality Assessment Inventory has
become popular. Another important test is Millon's Clinical Multiaxial Inventory (the MCMI), which was
developed in accordance with Millon's own theories on personality development and personality disorders
(see Appendix A). The MCMI was designed with certain advantages in mind, including being relatively
short compared to the MMPI and being connected with a specic clinical theory. However, since the test
was designed specically to distinguish amongst psychiatric populations, it is not as useful when assessing
normal individuals (Keller et al., 1990; Groth-Marnat, 2003).
Behavioral assessment and thought sampling are techniques designed to gain an appreciation of what an
individual actually does and/or thinks on a day-to-day or moment-to-moment basis. In each case, observers
are trained to make precise observations of an individual at precise times. This provides a statistical sample
of the individual's actual behavior and/or thoughts over time. Naturally the only person who can record
an individual's thoughts is that person himself or herself, but as long as they are carefully informed of the
procedure and are fully cooperating, the technique works ne. When applied correctly, the great value of
these techniques is that they are truly objective, in other words, they record

actual

behaviors and

actual

thoughts.

Assessing Personality with Projective Tests
The two most famous projective tests are the Rorschach Inkblot Technique and the Thematic
Apperception Test (or TAT). Both tests involve the presentation of ambiguous stimuli in an attempt to
draw out responses from a patient, responses reecting impulses and/or thoughts that the patient may not

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION TO PERSONALITY

26

even be aware of (i.e., the patient projects their own thoughts and feelings onto the ambiguous stimuli, even
if those thoughts and feelings are subconscious).
The Rorschach Inkblots are just that, inkblots on a piece of paper that can look like most anything. An
individual being tested is rst asked to say what each inkblot looks like, and then they are asked to explain
how they saw what they identied. The answer to a single inkblot is not particularly informative, since any
one inkblot may remind the person of some particular thing. However, as the patient goes through all 10
inkblots, trends should become apparent to the psychologist that reect the dominant issues aecting the
personality of the patient (again, even if those issues are subconscious and not available to the conscious
awareness of the patient). Initially, the Rorschach was reviewed unfavorably and then ignored. Rorschach
became depressed, and died only 9 months after the test was published.

Eventually, however, the test

became more and more popular, and today is certainly one of the most widely recognized psychological
tests.

However, studies comparing the Rorschach and the MMPI have shown the latter to be far more

valid. In an eort to improve both the reliability and validity of the Rorschach technique, there is now a
standardized scoring system.
The TAT is similar to the Rorschach, except that it involves actual pictures of people (although they are
still very ambiguous drawings) and the patient is asked to tell a story about the people in the picture. There
is no objective scoring system for the TAT, so reliability and validity remain arguable, and the test is more
famous than popular as an assessment tool. However, it has been shown to have high validity for certain
specic research studies, such as studies on the need for achievement, and continues to serve a function in
clinical formulations.

Clinical Interviews
As valuable and informative as the well-established psychological tests are, there is certain vital information that simply cannot be addressed with most tests, such as: a person's appearance, their attitude,
facial expressions, ability to communicate with another person, etc. In addition, tests often lead to further
questions, or the need for clarication or explanation. In order to address such issues, both in general and
in greater detail, clinical interviews are an essential part of the overall personality assessment. Although the
results of an interview are somewhat subjective, when viewed in the context of the psychologist's clinical
experience, along with results of an assessment tool, they provide psychologists with a much more complete
understanding of the person whom they are evaluating.

Discussion Question: Have you or anyone you know ever had psychological testing (don't forget
standardized tests of knowledge and intelligence in school!)?

If you are at all familiar with psychological

testing, for any reason, what eect did it have on you (or someone you know)?

Critical Thinking in Psychology
Critical thinking is always important in psychology, but given the complexity of individual personalities,
the many dierent theories, and the variety of approaches for studying and assessing personality, it is
particularly important for our consideration here. Although we often think of the word

critical

as something

negative, when we talk about critical thinking in psychology we are actually talking about being open-minded
to many possible answers, but arriving at a most likely answer in a reasoned and logical fashion. Critical
thinking is a skill, but unfortunately one that all too often isn't taught (Halpern, 1996, 2007; Sternberg,
2007).
A typical approach to teaching critical thinking is to use examples of false claims and systematically
deconstruct the manner in which they are made to appear true, while at the same time discussing the
psychological processes involved in decision making (see, e.g., Halpern, 1996; Ruscio, 2006). John Ruscio
has done a nice job of organizing his discussion around four areas pertaining to the tactics of pseudoscientists
who would intentionally mislead us: 1) deception, the methods they use to deceive us; 2) self-deception, the
types of evidence that lead us toward unwittingly deceiving ourselves; 3) psychological tricks, a variety
of tricks that create and sustain unwarranted beliefs; and 4) the decision-making process and the ethical
concerns of pseudoscientic practices. Ruscio (2006) has also provided a handy list of the characteristics of
pseudoscience:
1. Outward Appearance of Science
2. Absence of Skeptical Peer Review

3. Reliance on Personal Experience
4. Evasion of Risky Tests
5. Retreats to the Supernatural
6. The Mantra of Holism
7. Tolerance of Inconsistencies
8. Appeals to Authority
9. Promising the Impossible
10. Stagnation
While it may seem tempting for you to take for granted that you do not need to apply critical thinking
to the theories presented in this book, that could present something of a problem for you. Many of these
theories disagree with one another.

Although the major theories have all been proposed by famous and

respected theorists, some critics claim they were not developed scientically, and the spiritual paths that
will be discussed in the last section of the book have many skeptics. As you consider each theory, there are
some critical thinking skills you can keep in mind. What is your goal as you evaluate a theory? What do you
know and how are you drawing conclusions? If your class is having a debate or a discussion what is being
said, how is it being said, and how are the arguments being analyzed? Are certain conclusions probable;
are you, or others, overcondent in your conclusions? Have you considered alternatives? Practicing these,
and other, skills can help to develop your critical thinking abilities (Halpern, 2007). Finally, consider this
simple denition of critical thinking oered by Diane Halpern:
Critical thinking is the use of those cognitive skills or strategies that increase the probability of a desirable
outcome. It is used to describe thinking that is purposeful, reasoned, and goal directed - the kind of thinking
involved in solving problems, formulating inferences, calculating likelihoods, and making decisions, when the
thinker is using skills that are thoughtful and eective for the particular context and type of thinking task.
(pg. 6; Halpern, 2007)

Discussion Question: When you hear someone make a claim, whether it is something scientic or a
commercial advertisement, do you tend to believe it, or do you apply critical thinking to evaluate whether
the claim is likely to be true?
Personality Theory in Real Life: Making the Connection Between
Your Life and Personality Theory
In this chapter we do not have a particular theory or perspective within which to consider your own life.
So, let's try considering your life in any way you want. I do want you to consider one basic question, though.
Who are you? You might also ask yourself what makes you the person you think you are. Try writing down
some of your thoughts. Writing the ideas down helps to force you to really pay attention to your thoughts,
rather than just casually thinking about the questions without going into any detail. When you are done,
take a look at what you have written. Ask yourself again, Is that really me? You may want to write down
your new thoughts after evaluating what you have written.
Then try something that may be very interesting, but possibly a little unnerving. Ask a friend or relative,
someone you think really knows you well, and have them write down some ideas on who you are.

Don't

bother them, or distract them, while they are doing this. Let them have the time they need to do it. Then
look at what they have written, and once again ask, Is that really me? Finally, compare what you wrote
and what they wrote. Is there a dierence, and if so, is it a big dierence?
Whether the dierent descriptions of who you are or, in other words, the descriptions of your personality
are the same or dierent, how do you feel about that?

Some may nd comfort in learning that others

see them as they see themselves. Some may be confused if others see them quite dierently than they see
themselves. There are no right or wrong answers here, it is just an exercise to help you begin thinking about
how psychologists study personality. As we move through the various theories and perspectives presented
in this textbook, it will provide a starting point from which you can hopefully learn something interesting
about yourself and about the people you interact with every day.

1.5 Review of Key Points
•

There is no simply denition of personality.

The nomothetic approach focuses on personality as a

construct, while the idiographic approach emphasizes the uniqueness of individuals.

•

A wide variety of theoretical perspectives inuence how psychologists view personality, including psychodynamic factors, learning/cognitive factors, biological factors, inherent drives, and sociocultural
inuences.

•

The various personality theories also address questions related to nature vs. nurture, whether individuals are unique or whether there are types of personality common to all people, the relative importance
of the past, present, and future, and the signicance of free will.

•

An important trend in psychology today is the emphasis on positive psychology, and the potential for
the eld of psychology to contribute in positive ways to society.

•

A variety of research designs have been used by personality theorists.

Historically, many famous

theorists relied on case studies. When possible, however, many psychologists prefer the experimental
design, since only true experiments allow psychologists to make case-and-eect statements.

More

recently, some psychologists have begun to focus on cross-cultural and multicultural approaches to
studying personality.

•

A wide variety of personality tests have been developed, both objective and projective tests.

Since

it often proves dicult to establish the reliability and validity of some personality tests, a clinical
interview is an essential step in forming an opinion regarding someone's personality (especially if there
is a question of mental illness).

•

Critical thinking is purposeful, reasoned, goal-directed thinking aimed at evaluating claims that are
made as being true.

Culture and Personality

In the rst chapter we briey examined the concern of many psychologists that the eld of psychology
has been slow to embrace the value of cross-cultural research (see Lee et al., 1999; Sue, 1999; Triandis &
Suh, 2002). This concern is by no means new. In 1936, Ralph Linton wrote that dierent societies seem
to show dierences in the relative frequency of occurrence of the various psychological types (pg.

484),

and in 1973, Robert LeVine suggested that this is a moment at which even those who are skeptical about
the value of culture and personality study might consider stretching their curiosity in this direction (pg.
ix).

Throughout this textbook we will examine a number of theorists who emphasized studying cultural

dierences as a signicant part of their careers and, often, their personality theories as well.
However, it remains true that cross-cultural studies in psychology have only recently moved closer to the
mainstream of psychological research and clinical practice. As of 2002, the American Psychological Association has Guidelines on Multicultural Education, Training, Research, Practice, and Organizational Change
for Psychologists (www.apa.org/pi/multiculturalguidelines/homepage.html).
of the range of current interest in cross-cultural psychology, we now have a

Psychology

To cite just a few examples

Dictionary of Multicultural

(Hall, 2005) and books on the relationships between culture, mental illness, and counseling (Ax-

elson, 1999; Castillo, 1997), as well as on the relationships between race, class, and the social and personal
development of women (Jordan, 1997b; Pack-Brown, Whittington-Clark, & Parker, 1998). There are also
major new texts on African American psychology (Belgrave & Allison, 2006) and racism, prejudice, and
discrimination in America (Miller & Garran, 2008; Whitley & Kite, 2006).
The fact that studying cross-cultural factors in personality has always been present in the careers and
theories of certain individuals, while not becoming a mainstream focus of attention, is more than just an
historical curiosity. By emphasizing biological factors (i.e., genetics), Freud's theory did not allow for cultural
dierences. Behavioral theorists emphasized environmental factors, a seemingly cultural approach, but they
did not allow themselves to address factors beyond immediate scientic control. Thus, they dened with
great precision the role of reinforcement, punishment, discriminative stimuli, etc., while not allowing for the
richness of cognition and cultural experiences. Likewise, cognitive theorists clung to the scientic approach of
the behaviorists, rather than embracing the potential of sociocultural perspectives. In other words, because
strict Freudian theorists, as well as behavioral and cognitive theorists, believed that their theories applied to
all people equally, they typically chose not to address dierences between people. Thus, those who wished to
bring sociocultural perspectives on the development of personality into the eld of personality theory faced
a degree of direct opposition. And yet, their perseverance is now being fullled.
In this chapter, we will briey examine some of the issues facing personality psychologists who wish
to examine personality development in a sociocultural context. The United States, Canada, and Western
Europe represent only about one tenth of the world's population. Ralph Linton, a renowned anthropologist
with an interest in cultural inuences on personality (see Linton, 1945), also edited a book entitled

CHAPTER 2. CULTURE AND PERSONALITY

30

that we consider the inuence of dierent cultures around the world if we are going to claim that we have
really examined human personality in all its variations.

Cultural Studies in the Field of Psychology
Since the 1990s, a number of general books on psychology and culture have been available (e.g., Brislin,
2000; Lonner & Malpass, 1994; Matsumoto, 1994, 1997; Matsumoto & Juang, 2004; Okun, Fried, & Okun,
1999; Price & Crapo, 2002; Segall et al., 1990).

Although all of these books address topics such as the

self  and person-perception, and other various aspects of personality, only a few of them devote an actual
chapter or section to the topic of personality itself (Matsumoto & Juang, 2004; Price & Crapo, 2002; Segall
et al., 1990), and in each case the topics are fairly specic. There is, however, some older literature on the
relationships between culture, society, and personality. We will examine that research in the second part of
this section. First, let us examine some of the general principles of incorporating cross-cultural perspectives
into the study of personality.

The Challenges of Cultural Research
The rst problem faced by those who are interested in the study of culture and personality is the question:

Cross-cultural
research typically refers to either parallel studies being conducted in dierent cultures, or similar concepts
being studied in dierent cultures. In contrast, intercultural research is the study of individuals of

what exactly is to be studied? At the most basic level, there are two types of research.

dierent cultures interacting with one another (Brislin, 2000; Matsumoto & Juang, 2004; Segall et al., 1990).
As you will see in later chapters, some personality theorists consider interpersonal relationships to be the
only true domain for studying individual personality. While most of the research done in psychology has
been cross-cultural, as the world becomes more and more of a global community the opportunity for, and
importance of, intercultural research is rapidly expanding.
Another fundamental problem with the study of culture is our attention to it, or rather, the lack of
attention we pay to something that is so deeply ingrained in our daily lives. Richard Brislin suggests the
following exercise: write down three answers for someone from a dierent culture who asks What should I
know about your culture so that we can understand each other better?

(pg. 10; Brislin, 2000). Because

we simply take our cultural inuences for granted, it proves quite dicult for us to think that they need to
be identied or explained. For example, freedom of speech is a cherished right in America. Consequently,
we often speak our minds. If I am upset about some new college policy, I might say very negative things
about the administration of our college, even about particular administrators. It does not mean I intend to
be disrespectful, or that I dislike those individuals, or that I won't say positive things about them when I
agree with the next new policy. It is simply an expression of one of the great freedoms in our society: the
right to speak out. However, someone from a dierent culture, particularly a collectivist culture, might be
shocked at my apparent disrespect toward my superiors.
The next important issue is the dierence between

emic and etic tasks or behaviors. Simply put, emic

tasks are those that are familiar to the members of a given culture, whereas etic tasks are common to all
cultures. In an elegantly simple, yet revealing study, Irwin, Schafer, & Feiden (1974) demonstrated these
phenomena in two cultures: American undergraduates and Mano rice farmers (from Liberia). The American
college students were consistently better at performing the Wisconsin Card Sort, a well-known psychological
test measuring cognitive reasoning skills, which relies on geometric shapes and color. The Mano farmers,
however, were consistently better at sorting dierent categories of rice. Thus, the ability to sort items into
categories appears to be an etic task (most likely common to all humans, regardless of culture), whereas the
more specic abilities to sort by geometry and color (common to American college students) or type of rice
grain (common to Mano farmers in Liberia) is an emic task that requires familiarity. Thus, if we made a
judgment about the Mano farmers' cognitive abilities based on the Wisconsin Card Sort, we would clearly
be making a mistake in comparing them to Americans, due to the unfamiliarity of the particular task.
Another important aspect of cross-cultural research, which may involve applying our understanding of
etics and emics, is the issue of

equivalence. Is a concept being studied actually equivalent in dierent

cultures? In other words, does a concept mean the same thing in dierent cultures, is the comparison valid?
For example, an etic related to intelligence is the ability to solve problems. So how might we compare dierent
cultural groups? Would the speed with which they solve a problem make sense as a measure of intelligence?

31

Such an answer would be emic, and therefore valid, in America (where we typically value independence and
competition). However, among the Baganda of Uganda, slow and careful thought is the emic. Among the
Chi-Chewa of Zambia, the emic is responsibility to the community, i.e., solving the problem in order to best
get along with other people.

Thus, the speed at which people solve problems is conceptually equivalent,

since it is the way in which people in each culture identify those individuals who are considered intelligent
(Brislin, 2000). However, we cannot compare the actual speed of reporting a solution to others, as this is
viewed quite dierently in each culture.
One particular type of equivalence that raises a very interesting problem is that of translation equivalence. Psychologists often want to use tests developed in their own language with people of a dierent
culture who speak a dierent language. Translating a test from one language to another can be a dicult
task. The best way to assess translation equivalence is through

back translation. In this procedure, one

person translates the test, or survey, into the foreign language, and then a dierent person translates the
foreign language test back into the original language. The original test can then be compared to the back
translated test to see how closely they are worded. Ideally they would be identical, but this is seldom the
case. To give you a simple example, when I was in graduate school, we had a student from Taiwan join our
research group. One day I asked her to translate my last name, Kelland, into a Chinese character. When
she had done that, I asked her how she would translate that particular Chinese character into English for
someone who was not Chinese.

She translated the character as Kwang.

Despite the rst letter, I hardly

consider Kwang to be a reasonable translation of Kelland, but she didn't seem to think of this as much of a
problem (perhaps revealing another cultural dierence!). When the process of back translation is used successfully, which may involve working back and forth with the translations, it has the eect of

decentering

the test from the original language. Specically, that means that the test should be free of any culturally
emic references or aspects that interfere with the translation equivalence of the dierent versions of the test
(Brislin, 2000; Matsumoto & Juang, 2004).
While the list of issues pertaining to cross-cultural research goes on, let's consider just two more specic
issues:

cultural exibility and cultural response sets. Cultural exibility refers to how individuals are

willing to change, or adapt, in situations in which they know there are cultural dierences. For example,
American businesspeople can stand about 15 minutes of small talk before getting down to business. Their
Japanese counterparts, in contrast, consider it important to get to know their business partners, and they
are comfortable with hours of conversation about a variety of topics. This would, of course, be an important
consideration for anyone studying the relationship between individual personality and success in business
situations in this intercultural setting. Cultural response sets refer to how a given culture typically responds.
If a given culture is more reserved, and they are asked to rate the importance of some value in comparison
to how a more open culture rates that value, a dierence in the rating may reect the cultural dierence
in responding, rather than the degree to which people in each culture value the variable being measured
(Brislin, 2000; Matsumoto & Juang, 2004).
Finally, in light of these challenges, it may be particularly important to conduct cross-cultural validation studies. Rather than testing hypotheses about specic cultural dierences, cross-cultural validation
studies are used to examine whether a psychological construct that was identied in one culture is meaningful and equivalent in another culture (Brislin, 2000; Matsumoto & Juang, 2004).

For example, as we

will see in Chapter 7, Erik Erikson did not feel condent in proposing his eight stages of development (the
psychosocial crises) until he had conrmed his observations in two separate Native American tribes. He was
able to gain the trust of these groups, and thus able to closely observe their child-rearing practices, thanks
to the anthropologists who introduced him to the tribes they had been studying for a long time.
Anthropologists have done much more for psychology than merely introducing some psychologists to
cultural issues and unique cultural groups. Some of them have had their own interests in personality. Many
anthropologists, as well as some psychologists, have relied on

ethnographies to report detailed information

on the customs, rituals, traditions, beliefs, and the general way of daily life of a given group. They typically
immerse themselves in the culture, living for an extended period of time with the group being studied (this
helps get past the anxiety of being observed or any lack of cultural exibility). Comparing the ethnographies
of dierent groups can help guide cross-cultural psychologists in determining the likelihood that their cross-

CHAPTER 2. CULTURE AND PERSONALITY

32

cultural studies are valid (Matsumoto & Juang, 2004; Segall et al., 1990).

Discussion Question: Translating psychological tests into dierent languages is often a problem for
cross-cultural psychologists. Americans have a reputation for only knowing English, whereas people in other
countries often speak more than one language.

Do you know a foreign language well enough to actually

communicate with someone in another country? How important do you think it is to learn another language
as part of understanding their culture?

Placing Cross-Cultural Studies in Context: Blending
Psychology with Anthropology
As the eld of psychology entered the twenty-rst century, there was a groundswell of interest in cultural
factors as they pertain to all areas of psychology.

In the eld of personality, as well as in other areas,

there have always been individuals with an interest in culture and society, but they tended to remain as
individuals. Although they were often admired for their unique interests and ideas, the major emphasis in
psychology was on the scientic method and data that had been obtained in carefully controlled situations,
and then analyzed with similar, exacting precision. Culture, as dicult as it is to dene, was left largely to
anthropologists and sociologists.
Anthropologists, in particular, were not as shy about addressing the domain of psychology, and a number
of anthropologists crossed over into the study of psychology to such an extent that they are often mentioned
even in the introductory psychology textbooks. But given that their primary interest was in anthropology,
they did not form detailed personality development theories of the type presented in this (or other) personality
textbooks. In this chapter, however, we will take a look at some of the ideas presented by the renowned
anthropologist Ralph Linton, and his occasional colleague Abram Kardiner, a psychoanalyst with an associate
appointment in the same anthropology department as Linton.

In addition to their books, students of

personality with a strong interest in cultural inuences on personality will also nd the works of Ruth
Benedict and Margaret Mead of great interest.

The Inuence of Culture and Society on Personality
Many psychology textbooks mention a few famous anthropologists, such as Ruth Benedict and Margaret
Mead, whose research included work on child development and personality. However, less well-known in the
eld of psychology is the renowned anthropologist Ralph Linton, who paid particular attention to personality
development in relation to culture and society. Linton also collaborated with Abram Kardiner, a founding
member of the New York Psychoanalytic Institute (and who was analyzed by Sigmund Freud himself in
1921-1922). Linton and Kardiner freely acknowledged the connections between anthropology and psychology,
noting the inuence of Benedict and Mead, Franz Boas (recognized as the father of American anthropology
and mentor to both Benedict and Mead), and the psychoanalysts Anna Freud, Erich Fromm, Karen Horney,
and Wilhelm Reich (Kardiner, 1939; Kardiner, Linton, DuBois, & West, 1945; Kardiner & Preble, 1961).
Linton described personality as existing on three levels.
either its content or its organization.

First, personality can be described based on

The organization, furthermore, can be examined in terms of its

supercial organization or its central organization. The central organization of personality gives the whole
personality its distinctive character, and includes the most invariant aspects of personality, such as the
degree of introversion/extraversion, or other aspects of temperament (Linton, 1936, 1945). Although these
temperamental attributes are present at birth, they do not comprise personality

per se.

The supercial

organization of personality, however, is based on the goals and interests of the individual, and incorporates
the individual's experiences in life within the context of the central organization. In this regard, the supercial
organization should not be confused with something transient or insignicant. It is supercial only in the
sense that it is on the surface of the personality, and the goals and interests of the person are based on the
content of personality that represents their life experiences as they are organized within the personality. The
goals and interests themselves, which incorporate the content of personality, are determined almost entirely
by the culture in which the individual is raised.

According to Linton (1936), the process of integrating

the individual's experience within the context of one's temperament (or constitutional qualities) forms a
mutually adjusted, functional whole.
A critical question, of course, is whether cultural experiences can aect the central organization. Linton
(1936, 1945, 1955) believed that no matter how an individual receives the cultural characteristics of their

33

society, they are likely to internalize them, a process known as

enculturation. One of the main reasons

that enculturation is so inuential in every aspect of the person's being, is that it pervades every aspect of
the society in which the person lives. Thus, even someone who is considered a rebel, most likely exists within
a range of rebellion that is possible within that particular culture. This is directly related to the apparent
reality that cultures do give rise to certain types of personality. Making the matter even more complicated, or
simpler depending on one's perspective, is the role of status within a culture. Thus, although a given culture
or society, or one's own temperament, may inuence personality in one direction, a particular social class
might inuence personality in a dierent direction. An individual born into a given class, whose personal
constitution does not t that class, may develop what Linton called a

status personality, i.e., a persona

that ts with societies expectations for the individual in certain settings. For example, someone born into
an upper middle class family involved in business, who is personally rather introverted and withdrawn, may
present a condent and outgoing personality when working, and only upon returning home do they revert
to their natural inclination to be shy and quiet.
One of the most interesting points made by Linton is that individuals with complimentary personalities
are also mutually adjusted. The most obvious example is that of the gender roles of men and women. Men
are expected, in many cultures and societies, to be the dominant member of the family, as well as the breadwinner. Conversely, women are expected to be submissive, and to remain home and care for the household
and the children.

In this way, the men and women together complete the necessary tasks for family life

without entering into conict (at least in theory!). In some cultures, these gender roles are quite relaxed
with regard to the sex of the individual. Amongst the Comanche (a Native American tribe), men whose
personalities were not at all suited to being warriors assumed a special role, that of
1936). The

berdache

berdache

(Linton,

wore women's clothes, and typically fullled a woman's role, but they were treated

with somewhat more respect than women (in keeping with the patriarchal nature of the society). Some were
homosexuals (though not all), and even married. This was generally accepted, and any disapproval these
relationships received was directed toward the warrior husband, not the

berdache !

Abram Kardiner, a psychoanalyst who collaborated with Linton, shared the same general perspective on
the relationship between personality and culture, and attempted to put the relationship into psychological
terms.

He distinguished between the

basic personality, or ego structure, which he considered to be
character, which is their unique adaptation to the environ-

a cultural phenomenon, and the individual's

ment within their cultural setting. Thus, each individual develops a unique character, but only within the
constraints of the culturally-determined range of potential ego structure (Kardiner, 1939). The process of
personality development, within a cultural setting, results in what Kardiner called a

security system. The

security system of the individual is the series of adaptations that serve to ensure the individual's acceptance, approval, support, esteem, and status within the group. Thus, for each person within a given cultural
group, their basic personality is formed through an ongoing interaction with the very culture in which that
person needs to be (and, hopefully, will be) accepted as a member. Both of Kardiner's major books,

people.
Robert LeVine, like Kardiner, was an anthropologist and psychoanalyst with a strong interest in personality (LeVine, 1973, 1974). He begins by asking the question of whether there are dierences in personality
between dierent cultural groups. If there are not, then any analysis of the nature or causes of those alleged
dierences is meaningless. If there are dierences, can we then point to specic evidence that the environment
can elicit changes in those dierences? The answer is yes to both, and as one example LeVine points to the
dramatic

acculturation of rural immigrants from underdeveloped areas of Europe and Asia who emigrated

to industrialized countries, such as the United States, and within two or three generations had radically
altered not only their basic ways of life, but also their social class (moving from traditional peasantry to the
middle-class; LeVine, 1973). LeVine also continued Kardiner's approach of using a psychoanalytic perspec-

psychoanalytic
ethnography. In an eort to justify the use of psychoanalytic ethnography, LeVine argues that there are

tive to evaluate and compare the nature of dierent cultures, and he proposed the term

enough common elements in the nature of all people and cultures to provide for valid comparisons of the
dierences between those same people and cultures (LeVine, 1973).
One of the most striking discussions of the relationship between culture and the potential for personality
development was oered by Pitirim Sorokin, the founder of Harvard University's sociology department and
a colleague of the trait theorist Gordon Allport (see Chapter 13). Sorokin points out that culture can have a
dramatic inuence on the biological substrates of personality. For example, through the use of contraception,
abortion, etc., many potential individuals are never born. Conversely, if such measures are prohibited, many
unwanted children are born. In addition, cultural rules and norms against sexual intercourse and/or marriage
between certain age groups, races, social classes, families, religions, etc., directly inuence the potential for
genetic variation within and across dierent groups of humans (Sorokin, 1947). Indeed, Sorokin took such
a broad view of the role of society and culture in the environmental universe of each individual, that he

sociocultural space
sociocultural distance. The concept of sociocultural distance has taken on new meaning since Sorokin

described trying to understand sociocultural phenomena by locating them in terms of
and

proposed it over 50 years ago. Today, anyone can travel around the world in a matter of hours or days, and
many people do so regularly. Technology and globalization have dramatically reduced the distance between
people, and consequently brought their cultural dierences into contact with one another. Eorts to study
cultures and societies alter the location of sociocultural phenomena within our own universe of personal
development. In other words, by studying the relationships between society, culture, and personality, we are
altering the meaning and inuence of those relationships, hopefully for the better.
As a nal note, although this section has highlighted the inuence of anthropologists and sociologists on
cross-cultural research in the study of personality, there has also been an inuence from psychology on these
investigators. As noted above, both Abram Kardiner and Robert LeVine were psychoanalysts. In addition,
Kardiner acknowledges having learned a great deal from a professor named John Dollard.

Dollard was a

sociologist who had studied psychoanalysis and who collaborated with Neal Miller (a psychologist trained
in learning theory) in an eort to apply classical learning theory to psychodynamic theory (see Chapter
10).

Dollard contributed a chapter to one of Linton's books, and was cited by both LeVine and Sorokin

(who was, again, also a colleague of Allport). Given such an interesting interaction between the elds of
psychology, anthropology, and sociology over half a century ago, it seems surprising that psychology is only
now emphasizing the value of focusing on cultural inuences on personality development.

Discussion Question: Have you ever had an interest in ethnography?

When you begin to learn

something about another culture, how much does it interest you? How inuential do you think your culture
has been in your own personal development?

Dierent Cultural Factors Aecting Personality
Since culture pervades every aspect of our lives, the number of cultural factors that we might examine
in the study of personality is quite large. However, there are a few major factors that stand out, and that
have been the subject of signicant research in the eld of psychology. Thus, we will take a brief look at
four major factors that will come up repeatedly throughout this book:

Religion as a Cultural Inuence
. . .religion in its turn exerts the

religion, race, gender, and age.

most decisive inuence upon all groups and systems of culture, from

science and the ne arts to politics and economics. Without knowing the religion of a given culture or group
- their systems of ultimate values - one cannot understand their basic traits and social movements. (pg. 228;
Sorokin, 1947)
The essential importance of religion was also recognized by Abram Kardiner and Robert LeVine, both of
whom, as noted above, studied anthropology and psychoanalysis (see Kardiner, et al., 1945; LeVine, 1973).
As we will see in the next chapter, the recognized founder of psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud, also placed
great emphasis on the inuence of religion and religious symbolism (though he did not believe in God).
Despite the importance of religion, as perhaps the most signicant cultural factor, there is variation in
the extent to which formal religious beliefs and practices are a part of the routine life of people in dierent
cultures (see Matsumoto & Juang, 2004). Since most psychologists were not emphasizing cultural factors as
an essential aspect of the early development of the eld (leaving that to anthropologists and sociologists),
and given Freud's powerful and convincing arguments against religion (see Chapter 3), it is not surprising

35

that psychology has not focused on the inuence of religion on personality. But that is changing, and despite
the role that religion has played in many political battles and outright war (as has been the case in the
Middle East for thousands of years!), religion and spirituality are also recognized as potentially favorable
aspects of psychological development in general, and personality development in particular, in the eld of
positive psychology (Compton, 2005; Peterson, 2006; Peterson & Seligman, 2004; Snyder & Lopez, 2005).
Given the importance of religion as a cultural determinant, and the emphasis on culture in this book, we
will examine the inuence of religion on personality development throughout this textbook.

Figure 2.1

Religion/spirituality appear to be the most signicant cultural factors aecting people's lives and personal
development. Islam, Buddhism, Taoism, Yoga, Christianity, and Judaism, taken together, represent the
religious or spiritual traditions of some 5 to 6 billion people, most of the world's population. Shown are some
of the author's copies of the Holy Bible, Holy Quran, Discourses of the Buddha, Yoga-Sutra, Bhagavad Gita,
and the Tao Te Ching.
The Question of Race and Ethnicity as Cultural Inuences
At the very outset we must face three possible alternatives as we consider the concept of race: 1) there is
such a thing as race in mankind; 2) there is not such a thing as race in mankind; 3) even if race in mankind
exists, it can have no signicance save as people think of it and react to their conception of it.

(pg.

38;

Krogman, 1945)
Although religion may be the most signicant cultural factor, the concept of race has probably existed
even longer, and it is certainly the most visually obvious factor.

But is it really?

The fact is that there

is no clear answer to the question of what actually constitutes race (Krogman, 1945; Linton, 1936, 1955;
Sorokin, 1947). Although most people quickly think of three major races (White, Black, and Asian), and
many of us would add a fourth category (Latino), studies have suggested that there may actually be as many
as thirty-seven distinct races (see Matsumoto & Juang, 2004). In addition, genetic studies have suggested
that there is more inter-group variation than there is between-group variation, further suggesting that race

CHAPTER 2. CULTURE AND PERSONALITY

36

is nothing more than a social construction. As an alternative to race, some people use the term

ethnicity,

which identies groups according to commonalities such as nationality, culture, or language. This fails to
solve our problem, however, since the concept of ethnicity suers from the same problems as the concept of
race (Brislin, 2000; Matsumoto & Juang, 2004; Miller & Garran, 2008; Whitley & Kite, 2006).
Although the terms race and ethnicity are often used interchangeably with culture, they are quite dierent.
The United States, for example, has large populations of people from dierent races, ethnic groups, religions,
and nationalities, but they all contribute to the greater cultural identity of American.

Indeed, the very

concept of America as a melting pot dees the use of racial or ethnic characterizations of the American
people. This argument goes both ways, of course. We cannot simply refer to people who live within the
boundaries of the United States as American, and expect that they are similar in every other cultural respect.
Although this may seem rather confusing, that is exactly the point. Critical thinking must always be applied
to personality theories and their application in broad ways. This does not mean they are not useful, just
that we must be careful in our interpretations of people's behavior and personality if they are from another
culture.
Although ethnicity and race may be of questionable value as cultural factors, there are two critically

ethnocentrism, the belief that one's own culture has the right beliefs and practices, whereas other cultures have wrong
important issues that arise from them. A common problem in cross-cultural research is that of

beliefs and practices (Matsumoto & Juang, 2004; Whitley & Kite, 2006). Such value judgments interfere
with the objectivity of cross-cultural research, and can have negative eects on intercultural communication.
The other, very serious problem is that of

racism. As noted in the quote above, race is very real if people

believe in it and act according to their perception of it.

We will examine racism later in the textbook.

For now, consider the following quote from a recently published book entitled

Implications for the Helping Professions :

Its obstinacy and intractability are

We live in a world in which most nations have signed United Nations

declarations of human rights and claim to be democracies, yet racial and ethnic conict abound. (pg. xvii;
Miller & Garran, 2008)

Gender and Culture

Gender has been the subject of a wide range of studies, from pop-psychology books like Men Are From
Mars, Women Are From Venus (Gray, 1992) and Self-Made Man: One Woman's Journey into Manhood and
Back Again (Vincent, 2006) to such ominous sounding titles in academic psychology as The Longest War:
Gender and Culture (Wade and Tavris, 1994). In 2005, the president of Harvard University suggested that
one of the reasons there were so few women in math and science elds was that they lacked the intrinsic
aptitude.

The subsequent uproar led to the end of his presidency at Harvard, and a renewed eort to

examine the reasons why few women succeed in math and science careers. An extensive study, led by former
APA President Diane Halpern came to no specic conclusions, due to the complex interactions of a variety
of factors, but in so doing made it clear that no blame can be placed directly on inherent/genetic ability
(Halpern, et al., 2007; see also Barnett, 2007).
Gender is a distinctly cultural term, representing the behaviors or patterns of activity that a given
culture or society expects from men and women. It is perhaps most commonly used to address dierences
between males and females, with an underlying assumption that sex dierences lead to gender dierences.
However, apparent sex dierences may actually be cultural gender dierences, and cultures and societies
exert signicant inuence on

gender roles from a very early age (Brislin, 2000; Matsumoto & Juang, 2004;

Stewart & McDermott, 2004). Still, some cultural factors may also have a basis in biological reality. For
example, males are typically larger and stronger than females, so it makes sense for males to do the hunting
and ght the wars.

Women become pregnant and then nurse the infants, so it makes sense for them to

provide early childcare. How this led to man have greater control and prestige in society, however, remains
unclear, especially since that is not universally the case (Wade & Tavris, 1994). In addition, older men often
become involved in childcare after their hunting/warrior days are behind them, further complicating the
issue.
Among the dierences between men and women that seem to be fairly common across cultures, and

which may stem from sex dierences, are aggression and emphasizing relationships. Men are typically more
aggressive, and women seem to focus more on relationships with other people.

In accordance with these

tendencies, women typically defer to men, particularly in situations that may be confrontational.

It also

leads to conict between men and women due to their diculties communicating, hence the popularity of
John Gray's book suggesting that men and women are from completely dierent planets. Given the status
of men, the challenges that these gender dierences create for women were not typically given a great deal
of attention.

However, Karen Horney (see Chapter 8) and more recently the women of the Stone Center

Group (see Chapter 9) have made great strides in changing that situation. Not only have the members of
the Stone Center Group provided a number of collected works on the psychology of women (Jordan, 1997b;
Jordan, Kaplan, Miller, Stiver, & Surrey, 1991; Jordan, Walker, & Hartling, 2004), there are also textbooks
devoted exclusively to the subject (e.g., Matlin, 2004).

Aging within a Cultural Context
Age is used as routinely as sex to divide the people in a society. All societies recognize at least three age
groups: child, adult, and old. Childhood is typically further divided into young childhood and adolescence.
Each group has dierent rights, responsibilities, roles, and status (Linton, 1936; Sorokin, 1947). Sometimes,
these can come into conict.

For example, among the Comanche, as with most Plains tribes in North

America, the adult male was expected to be a warrior, whereas the old man was respected for his wisdom
and gentleness. Transitioning from being a warrior to being an old man was very dicult, and Comanche men
often hoped to die in battle in order to avoid the transition. Those who were forced to make the transition
became very dangerous adversaries for the young men transitioning from childhood to adulthood, and often
the old men would kill the young men when they could (out of sheer envy). Moving even beyond old age,
into death, there are many societies in which the dead remain in the minds of the community members, and
deceased relatives and heroes are even worshipped. In some cultures, the relationship with those who are
dead is a very important part of daily life (Linton, 1936).
Throughout history, as societies have changed, so have the ways in which they treated and cared for
(or did not care for) aged individuals. Although modern industrialization is correlated with a signicantly
longer lifespan, such dramatic cultural changes favor the young people who can more readily adapt to the
changes. In addition, industrialized societies typically shift some of the responsibility of caring for the aged
from the family to the state. Curiously, this removes the responsibility of caring for aged persons from the
very family whom those aged individuals had cared for and raised themselves! The one area in which aged
members of the community are likely to retain their leadership status is religion, and the rituals associated
with it (Holmes, 1983; Johnson & Thane, 1998; Schweitzer, 1983).
David Gutmann, an early gerontologist with an interest in the eects of aging on personality, has focused
his career on studying men in four cultures: a typical American population (to the extent that there is such
a thing), the Navajo in the United States, both Lowland and Highland Maya in Mexico, and the Druze in
Israel (see Gutmann, 1987, 1997). One of the most interesting realities that he begins with is the recognition
that the human species is the only one in which aged individuals remain active long past their reproductive
prime. What possible evolutionary advantage does this oer our species? Gutmann believes that our elders
ll unique roles in society, thus providing essential benets to the extended family and the community,
particularly for the young. Indeed, Gutmann points out that it is uniquely human to favor the ends of the
lifespan, both childhood and old age, over the middle of the lifespan, when reproductive tness is at its
biological peak. As we noted above, however, the transition into old age is not always easy, and this leads
to some unique changes in personality associated with aging.
The beginning of old age is marked by the maturity of one's children, such that the adult individual no
longer needs to provide care for their children. Thus, both men and women can begin to express those aspects
of their personality that were set aside in order to mutually facilitate raising children. Consequently, there is
often a relaxing, or even reversal to some extent, of gender roles. A particularly signicant change for men who
no longer have the physical strength to be warriors (or to engage in the physical labor of their community)
Young men have the ability to seek active
mastery, they strive toward autonomy, competence, and control. Older men must seek passive mastery,
through adaptation and accommodation. The oldest men must rely on magical mastery. The world
is the manner in which they seek mastery over their lives.

becomes one of potential providers and potential predators.

They rely on primitive defense mechanisms,

and wish fulllment becomes synonymous with reality. Their relationship to the world is marked by feelings
of vulnerability (Gutmann, 1987, 1997). It is easy to see how they would rely heavily on religion, and the
promise of a supernatural being for protection and eternal reward, thus inclining them toward an involvement
in religious practice that would naturally lead to a degree of respect, or at least acknowledgement, as religious
leaders. Of course, the degree to which a society provides for its oldest members, such as through retirement
benets, would have a signicant eect on this aging process.

Nonetheless, Gutmann found evidence for

these changes in mastery style amongst men in mainstream America as well as in the Navajo, Maya, and
Druze cultures.

Discussion Question: To what extent have religion, race, gender, and age been important factors
in your personal development (either currently, or in the past)?

Which do you expect will be the most

important in your future development?

Addressing the Degree of Cultural Integration
Adding to the complexity of culture's role in shaping our personalities are two important factors. First
is the degree to which an individual is integrated into their culture, and vice versa. As Sorokin points out,
it is exceedingly rare that an individual is either totally integrated into their culture or not integrated into
it at all (Sorokin, 1947; see also Kardiner, et al., 1945; Linton, 1936). Thus, culture provides a framework
within which individual variation is possible, but at the same time there will always be some consistent basis
for understanding the people within a given culture. This becomes particularly important when considering
cross-cultural research, since it may be reasonable to make some general assumptions about an individual
from another culture, but we must also be prepared for their own unique variation as a person in that cultural
group.
A second important factor is that cultural phenomena do not exist in isolation.

Both gender and

race/ethnicity, for example, inuence how one adapts to the aging process (see, e.g., Arber, Davidson, & Ginn,
2003; Barrow, 1986; Calasanti & Slevin, 2001; Cool & McCabe, 1983; Holmes, 1983). Gender also interacts
with race/ethnicity in determining one's reactions to group psychotherapy (Pack-Brown, Whittington-Clark,
& Parker, 1998) and/or adapting to life as a minority student on a majority campus (Levey, Blanco, & Jones,
1998). Religion is considered to be such an important factor in the African American community that its
role has been the subject of special interest (see, e.g., Belgrave & Allison, 2006; Taylor, Chatters, & Levin,
2004). Obviously many more examples can be found, the point being that as an individual develops, with
multiple cultural factors inuencing them, and each factor being integrated to a great or lesser degree, the
potential for individual personality dierences is extraordinary, even when the overall eect of the specic
culture, or society, is to guide its members toward certain underlying tendencies that become characteristic
of that culture's members.

Discussion Question: Are you, or is anyone you know, distant or unintegrated with your family's
culture or that your community? If so, what sort of problems does that create for your identities? If none,
does your cultural integration provide a sense of integrity?

Culture and Diversity
The importance of studying culture can be found in the diversity of people both around the world and
within our own communities. For example, although many communities may be quite limited in terms of
religion and race/ethnicity, nearly all communities have a mixture of gender and age.

Although religion,

race/ethnicity, gender, and age may be the major factors that have traditionally been studied in the eld of
psychology, in the instances where culture was studied, it is important to remember two additional points.
First, there are other cultural factors that may be very important for certain individuals and/or select groups
of people, and second, people can be excitingly (or frustratingly, depending on your point of view) unique
in their individuality.
One area of diversity that has been receiving more attention as a cultural factor aecting the lives of many
people is that of physical disability. In the past, although it was recognized that individuals with physical
disabilities experience basically the same personality development processes as other people, disabilities were
considered to be specic conditions that isolated the disabled person from their surroundings (Barker et
al., 1953; Pintner et al., 1941). Over time, as more research became available on the psychology of people

39

with disabilities (e.g., Goodley & Lawthorn, 2006; Henderson & Bryan, 1984; Marks, 1999; McDaniel, 1976;
Roessler & Bolton, 1978; Stubbins, 1977; Vash, 1981; Wright, 1983), perspectives on how to study these
individuals changed as well.

In 2004, the Society for Disability Studies adopted preliminary guidelines

for developing programs in disability studies.

They emphasize challenging the previously held view that

disabilities are individual decits or defects that can or should be xed by experts. Rather, they recommend
exploring models that examine cultural, social, political, and economic factors which integrate personal and
collective responses to dierence (the society's website is www.disstudies.org).
There are several chapters in this book where we will address the biological aspects of personality development, including the mind-body connection. Whereas a few academic authors have made passing mention
of the value of exercise, self-defense training, and spirituality in coping with physical disabilities (Nardo,
1994; Robinson, 1995; Sobsey, 1994), one particularly interesting area in which culture, physical disability,
the mind-body connection, positive psychology, and spirituality all come together is martial arts training (see
Kelland, 2009, 2010). A number of notable martial arts experts actively encourage people with disabilities
to practice the physical, psychological, and spiritual aspects of these ancient exercises (such as Grandmaster
Mark Shuey Sr. of the Cane Masters International Association, Master Jurgen Schmidt of the International
Disabled Self-Defense Association, and Grandmaster John Pellegrini of the International Combat Hapkido
Federation), and several books are available on this subject (McNab, 2003; Robertson, 1991; Withers, 2007).
We will revisit this topic later in the book, but for now consider the diversity of cultures and personal interests that come together when, for example, a disabled American living in the modern world pursues the
spiritual and physical development associated with an ancient, Asian practice of self-development.
When considering the life of an individual like Shawn Withers, the son of a Maine sherman, who suered
a massive stroke at the age of 20, but then went on to earn a black belt in Kenpo Karate and then developed
his own style known as Broken Wing Kenpo (Withers, 2007), broad descriptions of personality theory and
cultural perspectives fall short of giving us an understanding of the person.

Thus, some researchers, like

Dan McAdams (McAdams, 1985, 2006; McAdams et al., 2001), have emphasized the need for studying a
narrative framework within which we not only live our lives, but actually create them:

. . .like stories in literature, the stories we tell ourselves in order to live bring together diverse elements into
an integrated whole, organizing the multiple and conicting facets of our lives within a narrative framework
which connects past, present, and an anticipated future and confers upon our lives a sense of sameness and
continuity - indeed, an
as we

write

identity.

As the story evolves and our identity takes form, we come to

live

the story

it, assimilating our daily experience to a schema of self that is a product of that experience. (pg.

v; McAdams, 1985)
Although this textbook will cover broad personality theories and cultural perspectives, there are also
reective elements and discussion questions included to help you try to address your own narrative stories.
In addition, there are biographies at the beginning of each chapter on the major theorists, which although
they are not personal narratives, will nonetheless give some insight into the sort of person that theorist was,
and hopefully, how their life and their personal experiences helped to shaped the personality theory they
developed.

Culture and Mental Illness
Although this book focuses on normal personality development, one cannot escape the fact that most
of the famous personality theorists were clinicians who were trying to understand how their patients/clients
had developed psychological disorders.

So, our understanding of personality development grew hand-in-

hand with our understanding of psychological disorders. The

psychological disorder. The rst set of questions is the basis for the Cultural Formulation Interview, and

the second set comprise the Cultural Formulation Interview - Informant Version (which is given to someone
who is knowledgeable about the life circumstances and potential clinical problems of the patient/client).
In our increasingly global and multicultural world it is more and more likely that therapists will encounter
individuals from dierent cultural backgrounds than their own.

Thus, in order for the therapist to fully

understand the individual and the context of their psychological distress, the therapist must be aware of and
attentive to possibly signicant cultural dierences. Failure to do so might result in what Iijima Hall (1997)

cultural malpractice!
A Final Challenge

has described as

As important as it is to keep cultural factors in mind when studying personality, the unfortunate reality
is that the major personality theories in psychology, as we recognize psychology today, have arisen within
Western intellectual settings. Thus, we do not have corresponding systems of personality theory that arose
in other cultures that we might compare to the theories we do have. This somewhat limits our perspective
on cross-cultural personality theory to attempts to apply our Western theories to people of other cultures.
This limitation should not, however, keep us from considering these issues. It is merely an inconvenience
that you should keep in mind as you consider the theories present in this textbook. Should your career lead
you into the eld of psychology, perhaps you will be one of the people to help develop and advance some
theory that moves beyond this limitation.
Another concern has to do with the nature of this textbook, and personality courses in general. Although
we have emphasized anthropology and sociology in this chapter, this is a psychology textbook. Nonetheless,
culture is an all-encompassing factor in the development and psychology of both individuals and the groups
in which they live. Indeed, in

Personality and Person Perception Across Cultures, Lee, McCauley, & Draguns

(1999) boldly state that human nature cannot be independent of culture (pg. vii). Thus, it is essential
that we learn as much as possible about culture. As an encouragement for studying other cultures, Ralph
Linton had this to say:
The ability to see the culture of one's own society as a whole, to evaluate its patterns and appreciate their
implications, calls for a degree of objectivity which is rarely if ever achieved. . .Those who know no culture
other than their own cannot know their own. . .Even such a master as Freud frequently posited instincts to
account for reactions which we now see as directly referable to cultural conditioning. (pp. 125-126; Linton,
1945).

Personality Theory in Real Life: Examining Your Own Cultural Background
I consider myself to be an American. But what does that actually mean? I know a few tidbits about
my ancestors that are quite interesting. One of my ancestors, a great aunt, was on the Titanic when it sank
(like most women and children, she was one of the survivors). I am directly descended from John Howland
and Elizabeth Tilley, who came to America on the Mayower, in the year 1620. Actually, John Howland
fell overboard in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean during rough seas, but was saved when he grabbed a
rope trailing in the water and was then pulled back aboard! Among John Howland and Elizabeth Tilley's
other direct descendants (and, therefore, my distant relatives) are the U. S. Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt,
George H. W. Bush, and George W. Bush, the renowned poets Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry Wadsworth
Longfellow, and the founder of the Mormon church, Joseph Smith. This lineage does not, however, come
down through the Kelland name, as the Kellands came to America later. If you add one more generation,
John Howland's brothers include among their descendants U. S. Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford,
as well as British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. The other side of my family was primarily German,
and when they rst came to America they settled in Kansas and became well-respected wheat farmers.
What do you know about your cultural background? Are you proud of your background in a way that
has shaped your life? For example, knowing one of my ancestors was on the Mayower helped to kindle in
me an ongoing interest in history. If you don't know much about your family's history, who might you turn
to for information? Try it; you may learn something fascinating about yourself.

2.1 Review of Key Points
•

It is important for the eld of psychology to consider both cross-cultural and intercultural research.

•
•

Emic tasks are familiar to the members of a given culture, whereas etic tasks are common to all cultures.
In cross-cultural research, it is important to determine whether a concept is equivalent in each culture
being studied.

•

One of the most important considerations for the equivalence of psychological tests is the issue of
translation equivalence. This can be addressed, in part, through examining back translations of the
test(s) being used.

•

Back translation helps to decenter a psychological test from the cultural inuence of the original
language/culture.

•

Cultural exibility and cultural response sets determine the range within which members of dierent
cultures respond. Thus, one must have some understanding of these factors for a given culture when
attempting to interpret cross-cultural or intercultural research.

•

Cross-cultural validation studies specically examine whether a given cross-cultural study makes sense
within the context of a research project.

•

Ethnographies provide detailed information on the daily lives and habits of the members of a given
culture.

They are often conducted by anthropologists, and can be of great value to cross-cultural

psychologists.

•

Anthropologists, such as Ralph Linton, believe that personality develops on multiple levels. Central organization involves the biological aspects of personality (such as temperament), whereas the supercial
organization is profoundly inuenced by culture.

•

The process of enculturation involves internalizing cultural norms, and may be able to inuence the
central organization of individuals, as well as the supercial organization.

•

When an individual's basic personality contradicts that which their social class expects of them, they
may develop a status personality.

•
•

Complimentary personalities, such as those seen in typical gender roles, tend to be mutually adjusted.
The psychoanalyst Abram Kardiner, who worked with Linton, distinguished between the culturallydetermined basic personality, or ego structure, and the individual's character, which is their unique
adaptation to the environment given their inherent tendencies and personal experiences.

•
•
•

According to Kardiner, personality development within a cultural setting provides a security system.
Acculturation can lead to changes both in individuals and in entire cultures.
The anthropologist/psychoanalyst Robert Levine proposed the term psychoanalytic ethnography to
describe the work done by researchers like himself and Kardiner.

•

The sociologist Pitirim Sorokin described personality development within one's entire cultural universe,
referring to sociocultural phenomena in terms of their sociocultural space and sociocultural distance.

•
•

Religion appears to be the single most signicant cultural factor.
Race and ethnicity are complex, and are hard to consider as cultural factors because they cannot easily
be dened. Nonetheless, as individuals think about them in their own ways, they often give rise to
ethnocentrism and, potentially, racism and discrimination.

•

Although sex is a biological distinction, gender roles are an inuential cultural factor that is applied
from very early in life. Certain aspects of gender roles likely reect some of the underlying biological
dierences between males and females.

•

All societies recognize distinct age groups, and treat those age groups dierently. However, there is
great variation in the status of each age group, which often leads to conict.

•

Old age is of particular interest, since the human species is the only in which individuals remain active
long past their reproductive prime.

•

One of the common cross-cultural factors facing old men is the transition in how they seek master in
their lives. Only young men can expect to be successful seeking active mastery, whereas older men
seek passive master and then magical mastery.

•

In addition to sometimes dramatic dierences between cultures, individuals within a culture also dier
in the extent to which they integrate dierent aspects of their culture into their own lives.

•

Sometimes cultural phenomena interact, making for interesting, yet complex, situations. For example,
religion has played an important role in the cultural identity of African Americans throughout their

Sigmund Freud

Sigmund Freud is unquestionably the most famous person in the elds of psychiatry and psychology, and
one of the most famous individuals in modern history.

He is of particular importance for this subject

because he was probably the rst person to address psychological problems by examining the individual's
personal development in detail. As he developed his psychodynamic theory, and the treatment known as
psychoanalysis, he attempted to carefully observe and listen to his patients in order to determine not only
how and why they had become the person they were, but also whether those developmental processes might
be common to all people. This careful approach to studying psychological conditions was likely the result of
Freud's substantial scientic research in anatomy and physiology earlier in his career.
But why is Freud so famous? Much of his theory may not seem relevant today, and it's hard to imagine
how anyone could ever have come up with the theory of penis envy. And yet Freud remains extraordinarily
inuential. There are at least three good reasons for Freud's enduring inuence and popularity. First, Freud
was rst! No one before him had established a cohesive theory of the development of personality, especially
a theory that attempted to explain both normal and abnormal development. Thus, most theories developed
since then have been viewed as extending, modifying, or opposing Freud's psychodynamic theory. Second,
key elements of Freud's theory are generally accepted in psychology and psychiatry, such as the existence
of unconscious elements of our mind that can aect our thoughts and behaviors and both the normal and
abnormal roles of psychological defense mechanisms. The nal factor contributing to Freud's lasting inuence
is somewhat more complicated. Psychodynamic theory was not well received at rst. In fact, the emphasis
on childhood sexuality was ridiculed and scorned by many in the medical profession. However, Freud was
determined, and he did not let the rejection of others deter him from continuing his studies. In addition,
there were several very famous and inuential individuals who supported his eorts. Thus, Freud found the
motivation to persevere, and the rest, as they say, is history.

A Brief Biography of Sigmund Freud, M.D.
th

Sigismund Schlomo Freud was born on May 6

, 1856, in the small, industrial town of Freiberg in

Moravia (today it is known as Pribor in the Czech Republic).

Freud never used the name Schlomo, his

paternal grandfather's name, and he shortened his rst name while at the University of Vienna. His family
life was unusual, and somewhat complicated. His father, Jakob Freud, was 40 years old when he married
Freud's mother, Amalia Nathanson. She was 20 years younger than Jakob Freud, and several years younger
than Jakob's son, Emanuel, from an earlier marriage. One of Freud's rst friends was a nephew who was a
year older than Freud!
Jakob Freud was never particularly successful in business.

The industrial importance of Freiberg was

declining, so the young family left and eventually settled in Vienna, Austria (Jakob's sons from his rst
marriage, Emanuel and Philipp, emigrated to England).

At this point Jakob and Amalia Freud had two

children, Sigmund and his sister Anna (a brother born between them, Julius, died at 7 or 8 months of age).
Shortly after arriving in Vienna, however, they had ve more children during the years 1860-1866: Rosa,

Marie, Adolne, Pauline, and Alexander.

This resulted in continued nancial diculties, which appears

to have been painful for the young Freud (Gay, 1998). There were also personal diculties that made it
dicult for Freud to enjoy a close relationship with his father. Jakob Freud once told his son a story about
being abused by an Austrian Christian, a man who knocked Jakob Freud's hat into the muddy street and
then ordered the Jew to get o the sidewalk.

When Freud asked his father how he had responded, his

father said he simply stepped o the sidewalk and picked up his hat. Freud was very disappointed by what
he apparently perceived as weakness in his father (Gay, 1998).

There was also an embarrassing episode

involving his father's brother, Josef. Josef Freud was convicted and sent to jail for trading in counterfeit
money. This caused a great deal of concern for Jakob Freud, who might have been involved in the illegal
scheme along with his sons, Emanuel and Philipp (Gay, 1998; Jones, 1953).
Still, Jakob Freud did try to be a good father. His children were generally successful, and he remained
active and supportive in the lives of his children and grandchildren.

The story mentioned above, when

Jakob Freud tried to impart some fatherly wisdom to his son, may not have had the intended eect, but
it demonstrates that he cared about teaching his son some of life's lessons. On Freud's thirty-fth birthday
his father sent his dear son a copy of the family's Philippson Bible (this Bible contains the Old Testament,
which is the only testament in the Jewish faith), which Freud had often studied as a young child (Gay, 1998;
Jones, 1953; Nicholi, 2002). The inscription written by Jakob Freud in the Bible ended with a description of
the gift as a token of love from your old father (see Jones, 1953; Nicholi, 2002). When Jakob Freud died,
Freud wrote to a friend that his father's death had profoundly aected him, leaving him feeling uprooted.
He described the death of one's father as the most important event, the most poignant loss, in a man's life
(see Nicholi, 2002). The death of his father appears to have stimulated Freud's self-analysis, the writing of

The Interpretation of Dreams

(Freud, 1900/1995) and the formulation of his theory of the Oedipus complex

(Nicholi, 2002). Jakob Freud was also remembered quite fondly by his grandson Martin, the eldest son of
Freud (M. Freud, 1983).
Freud's relationship with his mother was also complex. Amalia Freud is described as young (which she
was, compared to Jakob), attractive, and energetic. She always took great pride in her son, and was a strong
and positive inuence throughout his life. Later in life he wrote that A man who has been the indisputable
favorite of his mother keeps for life the feeling of a conqueror, that condence of success that often induces
real success (see Jones, 1953). During Freud's self-analysis, around the year 1897, he uncovered profound
memories from his earliest years. Sometime between the ages of 2

½

and 4 years old, Freud accidentally saw

his mother naked. This event awakened a powerful desire in Freud. Shortly after recovering this memory, he
remembered the deep jealousy he had felt when his brother Julius was born, shortly before Freud was 2 years
old. So jealous was Freud, that he remembered welcoming the death of his infant brother (see Gay, 1998;
Jones, 1953). Each of these incidents certainly had an impact of Freud's theory of the Oedipus complex.
Surprisingly, however, during the rst 2

½

years of Freud's life he actually spent very little time with his

mother, since he was being raised by a nursemaid. Keep in mind that his mother became pregnant again,
then his brother Julius became ill and died, and then his mother became pregnant again, nally giving birth
to his sister Anna, all by the time Freud was 2

½

years old.

Freud's nursemaid has been described as an old and ugly woman, but Freud loved her and dreamed about
her later in life (see Gay, 1998; Jones, 1953; Nicholi, 2002). The nursemaid was a devout Roman Catholic,
and she regularly took Freud to church with her.

Despite his young age (less than 2

½

years old), Freud

would come home from church and preach to his family about God. Even though his family was Jewish,
they did not practice their faith with much devotion, and it must have been quite interesting to listen to the
sermons of their little boy. Why then, as we will see, did Freud come to reject religion and spirituality? It
turns out that this relationship ended abruptly. Freud's half brother Philipp accused the nursemaid of petty
theft, and she was sent to prison. At this time Freud's mother was conned with his recently born sister, so
Freud was suddenly denied access to both his mother and his nursemaid. It has been suggested that because
he was abandoned so suddenly, and at such a critical time (Freud was 2

½

years old at this time), by his

Roman Catholic nursemaid, that his anger and disappointment led to his ultimate rejection of the spiritual
worldview and his antagonism toward the Catholic church (Gay, 1998; Jones, 1953; Nicholi, 2002).

Freud was very successful in school from an early age.

At the Gymnasium, which is the term for a

preparatory school in countries such as Germany and Austria, he was rst in his class for 7 years. This led
to a variety of special privileges, including seldom being required to take any examinations (Freud, 1952). It
also led to privileges at home. According to his sister Anna, Freud always had his own room to study in, no
matter how dicult the family's nancial situation (Gay, 1998). As he prepared for college, Freud initially
wanted to study law. However, after learning about Darwin's theory of evolution and hearing Goethe's essay
on nature, he decided to become a medical student (Freud, 1952).
In 1873, Freud entered the University of Vienna. Initially he suered greatly from prejudice and discrimination against him because he was Jewish. Believing that he was expected to feel inferior and alien because
he was Jewish, he nonetheless persevered. As a result of these experiences, later in life he was prepared for
dealing with the considerable resistance that occurred in response to his theories (Freud, 1952). His rst
research project in medical school came at the suggestion of Professor Carl Claus. Prof. Claus was interested
in a report that the Polish scientist Simone de Syrski had identied structures that might represent the testes
of the male eel. This was a question that had been studied for centuries without success. After dissecting
some 400 eels, Freud appeared to have conrmed Syrski's ndings. The research was not denitive, however,
and Freud found little satisfaction in the publication of his work (Gay, 1998; Jones, 1953). He was, however,
about to nd satisfaction, in the physiological laboratory of Ernst Brucke.
Brucke was a renowned physiologist, anatomist, histologist, and more. Freud had great respect for his
newfound mentor, referring to him as Master Brucke and describing him as the greatest authority I ever
met. In Brucke's laboratory Freud found rest and full satisfaction at last (Gay, 1998; Jones, 1953). The
research he conducted under Brucke's guidance was impressive.
anatomy of the spinal cord and its neurons.

Brucke put Freud to work studying the

At that time, the structure of neurons was not understood.

Freud modied the histological staining methods being used in Brucke's laboratory, and eventually developed
a gold chloride method of staining nervous system tissue around the year 1880 (Jones, 1953). This was one of
the rst uses of a heavy metal stain on nervous system tissue. The silver nitrate method of staining neurons
had been developed by Camillo Golgi a few years earlier, in 1873, but it was not until 1888 that Santiago
Ramon y Cajal rst reported on the structure of the brain using Golgi's technique. For this research, Golgi
and Ramon y Cajal shared the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1906 (Finger, 1994). If Freud had not left basic
research for a career in medicine, he might have ended up famous just the same.
Freud did eventually leave the university, however, and began a career in medicine at the General Hospital
in Vienna.

Part of the reason for leaving and beginning his medical career was that he had met Martha

Bernays, the woman who would become his wife, and he needed to begin earning enough money to support
a wife and family. First, however, he needed to establish himself in his career. At the General Hospital he
met and worked with the eminent Theodor Meynert, who, among other accomplishments, was the rst to
correctly suggest that Parkinson's disease resulted from abnormal functioning of the basal ganglia (Finger,
1994). This stimulated Freud's continued interest in anatomy and brain function, and in 1891 Freud published
a book entitled

On Aphasia.

You may remember from introductory psychology that the two primary speech

centers in the human brain are Broca's area (speech production) and Wernicke's area (speech reception),
and that damage to these areas results in Broca's aphasia or Wernicke's aphasia. Carl Wernicke had also
been a student of Meynert, but Freud's book on aphasia was especially critical of Wernicke (Finger, 1994).
This put both men rmly in the middle of the debate on structuralism vs.
to the activities of the human brain (see Finger, 1994).

functionalism as it pertains

Although Meynert suggested that Freud should

devote himself to studying the anatomy of the brain, Freud had had enough of this sort of work in Brucke's
laboratory. Instead, Freud's interest turned toward the diseases of the brain (Freud, 1952). With the help of
a recommendation by Brucke, Freud was awarded a Traveling Fellowship, which allowed him to aord a trip
to Paris to study at the prestigious Salpetriere. He intended to study under Jean-Martin Charcot, one of
the world's foremost neurologists of his day, and the man who named Parkinson's disease after the physician
James Parkinson (Finger, 1994).
Freud was largely ignored when he arrived at the Salpetriere, since he was just one of a crowd of foreign
visitors. As luck would have it, one day he heard Charcot expressing regret that Charcot had not heard from
his German translator in some time, and he wished someone could be found to translate his latest lectures

into German.

Freud wrote to Charcot, oered to do the job, and was accepted.

From that point on he

became a member of Charcot's inner circle, and was active in all aspects of the work at the clinic (Freud,
1952). One of the main topics Freud studied with Charcot was the use of hypnosis in the study of hysteria.
Freud discussed the earliest conceptions of his psychodynamic theory with Charcot. Charcot was supportive
and agreed with Freud's edgling ideas, but Charcot's interests remained rmly in the eld of neurology, not
in psychology or psychiatry (Freud, 1952).
Upon returning to Vienna and settling down as a practicing physician, Freud was nally able to marry
Martha in 1886 (he was 30 years old, and she was 25).

They had six children: Matilde, Martin, Oliver,

Ernst, Sophie, and Anna. According to his son Martin, Freud was a loving and generous father (M. Freud,
1983). He was also very supportive of his children. As Martin became disillusioned with the study of law,
he turned to his father for advice:

. . .It had always been his hope that one of his sons would become a lawyer.

Thus he watched, and I think

guided, my rst faltering steps in my law studies with the greatest concern.
He agreed that my rst studies were dull and boring, but he assured me that one day I would nd a
teacher with an impressive personality, perhaps a man of genius, and that I would become deeply interested
and carried away by his lectures. . .
Father always expressed himself with great clarity and, when advising me at so critical a time in my life,
he added to his normal clarity of expression a natural tenderness and concern. . . (M. Freud, 1983; pg. 161)
Martin did become a lawyer and, after Martin served as an ocer in the Austrian army during World
War I, his father helped him to establish his practice.
Finally, any discussion of Freud's early research career would not be complete without mentioning what
Ernest Jones, Freud's ocial biographer, called the cocaine episode (Jones, 1953). In his last autobiographical book (Freud, 1952; originally published in 1925 in a collection of medical autobiographies) he makes
only passing reference to studying cocaine, reporting another near miss in his research career. He had begun
studying cocaine while he was away from Vienna, and an opportunity arose to return home for vacation and
an opportunity to see his ancé Martha. As he prepared to leave, he suggested to a couple of colleagues that
they examine the eectiveness of cocaine as an anesthetic for use in eye diseases. While Freud was visiting
Martha, one of his colleagues, Carl Koller, conrmed the local anesthetic properties of cocaine and became
famous for it. Afterward, Freud noted that it was the fault of my ancé that I was not already famous at
that early age, but he insists that I bore my ancé no grudge for her interruption of my work (Freud,
1952). Something quite fascinating is that Freud's interest in cocaine was initially based on the possibility
that its euphoric properties might be used to alleviate the problems associated with withdrawal from morphine. A close and long-time friend, Ernst von Fleischl-Marxow had become addicted to morphine because
of the extreme pain of an infection, and Freud hoped that cocaine would help. Freud himself began using
cocaine to boost his own mood. He sent some to Martha with the recommendation that she try it (there
is no evidence that she ever did), and he even began sending cocaine to friends, colleagues, and his sisters.
Eventually, however, Freud realized that cocaine was not helping his friend; indeed von Fleischl-Marxow
became addicted to cocaine instead of morphine. Freud eventually deeply regretted his research on cocaine,
especially since the one positive result of that research had garnered fame for a colleague while Freud was
on vacation (Gay, 1998; Jones, 1953).

Freud's Psychiatric Career
Many people believe that psychoanalysis was developed by Freud during the early years of his medical
practice in Vienna.

Freud, however, would disagree.

He insisted that psychoanalysis was begun by the

Viennese physician Josef Breuer (Freud, 1914/1995), a close friend and mentor of Freud.

The basis of

psychoanalysis lay in a patient that Breuer had seen as early as 1880, and had treated with hypnosis. This
case, and the use of hypnosis as part of the cathartic procedure developed by Breuer, was the original
inspiration for Freud's interest in hypnosis and his trip to Paris to study the technique with Charcot. When
Freud returned to Vienna, he asked Breuer to tell him all of the details of this case, which involved a young
woman. This famous patient, known as Anna O., was described by Breuer in the book coauthored by the
two men (Freud & Breuer, 1895/2004). As Freud used Breuer's techniques with his own patients, however,
he began to realize that something was lacking. Hypnosis did little to reveal the underlying causes of the

47

hysteria that their patients were experiencing. Since Freud was every bit the scientist, he needed to know
more about why he was able to help some patients. He eventually replaced hypnosis with his own techniques
of free association (early 1890s) and, eventually, dream analysis (essentially done in 1896, but not published
until 1900). This was the point at which psychoanalysis, in the sense that we think of it today, was born
(Freud, 1914/1995, 1952).
As Freud's ideas diverged from those of Breuer, the two parted ways. Freud then developed the aspect of
psychodynamic theory that led to his near total rejection by the German and Austrian medical communities:
the primacy of childhood sexuality. This theory was so dicult for others to accept that Freud spent nearly
10 years working on psychoanalysis in isolation. However, Freud claims that the concept of a sexual etiology
for the neuroses was not really his idea, it had been supercially suggested by Breuer, Charcot, and a highly
respected Viennese gynecologist named Chrobak (Freud, 1914/1995). During those years of isolation Freud
began to dene other major aspects of psychodynamic theory, such as: resistance, repression, conict, and
unconscious impulses.
Around 1902, Freud began to nd support for his theories among a select group of physicians. Shortly
thereafter a group of psychiatrists in Zurich, Switzerland, which included Eugen Bleuler (the man credited
with identifying both schizophrenia and autism as we dene them today) and his assistant Carl Jung, began
taking a lively interest in psychoanalysis (Freud, 1952). In 1909 Freud and Jung were invited to America,
where they were warmly received, and psychoanalysis became well-established in America and Canada. By
the 1910s it was reported that psychoanalysis was being championed in Austria, Switzerland, the United
States, Canada, England, India, Chile, Australasia (the region), France, Italy, Sweden, Russia, Hungary, Holland, and Norway (where the rst textbook on psychiatry that included psychoanalysis was written) (Freud,
1914/1995). Germany proved quite resistant, although the renowned Karl Abraham practiced psychoanalysis
in Berlin.
Perhaps it was inevitable that all of this success should eventually lead to conict. Two major groups,
whose members diered signicantly in their views on psychodynamic theory and psychoanalysis, broke
away from the main psychoanalytic groups. They were led by Alfred Adler (see Chapter 4) and Carl Jung
(Chapter 3). In his rst autobiography, Freud is not exactly kind to these two men. He goes to great length
to dismiss Adler's theories as mistaken, and he atly rejects Jung's perspective:
Of the two movements under consideration here, Adler's is undoubtedly the more important. Though
radically false, it is, nevertheless, characterized by consistency and coherence, and it is still founded on the
theory of the instincts. On the other hand, Jung's modication has slackened the connection between the
phenomena and the instinctive-life; besides as its critics (Abraham, Firenze, and Jones) have already pointed
out, it is so unintelligible, muddled and confused, that

...

it is impossible to know how one can arrive at a

correct understanding of it... (Freud, 1914/1995; pg. 940).
It is curious to speculate whether Freud's isolation for so many years may have led to the profound
possessiveness he later expressed regarding psychoanalysis as his technique, and his alone, in

the Psychoanalytic Movement:

The History of

...For psychoanalysis is my creation; for ten years I was the only one occupied with it, and all the
annoyance which this new subject caused among my contemporaries has been hurled upon my head in the
form of criticism. Even today, when I am no longer the only psychoanalyst, I feel myself justied in assuming
that nobody knows better than I what psychoanalysis is. . . (Freud, 1914/1995; pg. 901)

Freud's Final Years
Freud's nal years were somewhat tumultuous. The Nazis had taken over Germany and Austria, and
they were rapidly preparing for World War II. Being Jewish, Freud's life was in danger; indeed, at least three
of his sisters were murdered in the concentration camps, most likely in Auschwitz (M. Freud, 1983). Freud,
however, had inuential friends, including European royalty and wealthy individuals with ties to the British
and American governments. The American secretary of state, Cordell Hull, took word of the situation to
President Franklin Roosevelt, and following Roosevelt's instructions, Hull had the American ambassador to
Germany intervene on Freud's behalf (Gay, 1998; Jones, 1957).

Freud also received substantial help and

comfort from Marie Bonaparte, H.R.H. the Princess George of Greece, including the payment of a ransom in
order to secure permission for Freud to leave Austria (M. Freud, 1983). Finally, in May 1938, Freud, his wife

Martha, and their daughter Anna left together for England, along with Freud's dog. They were all received
quite warmly in London, except for the dog. She was quarantined for six months (M. Freud, 1983).
Freud, however, had already been ill for many years, and was suering a great deal of pain due to
cancer. He was also in his eighties. Nonetheless, Freud continued to work, and he completed

Psychoanalysis

(1938/1949) and

Moses and Monotheism

An Outline of

(1939/1967) while living in London. But the end

was near, and the cancer was progressing rapidly. In September 1939, Freud asked his doctor, Max Schur,
to remember an agreement the two had made not to prolong Freud's life unnecessarily. Freud asked Schur
to discuss his condition with Anna Freud.

Anna Freud at rst resisted, but eventually submitted to the

inevitable, and Schur administered a series of morphine injections that proved fatal. Sigmund Freud died on
September 23, 1939 (Gay, 1998; Jones, 1957).
In the funeral oration delivered by Ernest Jones, Jones remembered that three qualities had particularly
impressed him upon rst meeting Freud: rst, his nobility of character; second, his direct and instinctive
love of truth; and third, his courage and inexible determination. Jones also said that a great spirit has
passed from the world. . .for Freud so inspired us with his personality, his character and his ideas that we
can never truly part from him. . . (Jones, 1957). Prior to the escape from Austria, Freud had expressed a
sincere desire to die in freedom. He loved England, where he was able to accomplish that goal. In reference
to England and the funeral ceremony, Jones said:
He died surrounded by every loving care, in a land that had shown him more courtesy, more esteem and
more honor than his own or any other land, a land which I think he himself esteemed beyond all others. (pg.
247; Jones, 1957).

Placing Freud in Context: Connecting Personality Theories
Sigmund Freud was one of the greatest minds of modern times.

He was the rst person to provide a

comprehensive theory of personality and personality development, and he did so in what he considered to
be a logical and scientic manner. Since he was rst, however, how can we place him amongst the other
great psychologists? As I contemplated the importance of Freud to the history of psychology, I looked back
at my own graduate school training. The textbook assigned for my graduate history of psychology course
was

Theories and Systems of Psychology

by Robert Lundin (1979). In the chapter titles, Lundin mentions

only three psychologists by name: Wilhelm Wundt, the founder of experimental psychology; William James,
America's preeminent psychologist; and Sigmund Freud. Since Freud's name is also mentioned in the title of
the chapter devoted to his followers, Freud actually has two chapters devoted to his inuence. I also looked
at

A History of Psychological Theories

by Ross Stagner (1988), who was an esteemed faculty member in

the psychology department at Wayne State University in Detroit and author of one of the rst personality
textbooks (Stagner, 1937). Stagner mentions six individuals in the titles of his twenty-two chapters, and once
again Freud is among them. In addition, the well-known psychological historian Ludy Benjamin includes a
chapter on the correspondence between Freud and Jung in

A History of Psychology in Letters

(1993). There

are actually numerous books published on the correspondence between Freud and a variety of other people,
and thousands of those letters have been published. These are just a few examples of how deeply Freud is
recognized as a major gure in the history of psychology.
Another testament to the legacy of Freud is how enduring some of the issues he addressed have proven
to be. In the early years of the twenty-rst century there has been a growing conict between religion and
society.

In the United States the concept of separation of church and state has been challenged perhaps

most aggressively in our schools, with issues such as praying at school sporting events and the teaching
of creationism in science classes. In other countries, religious fundamentalists often stand in opposition to
the establishment of democratic governments. Increasing globalization does not seem to be bringing people
together, but rather bringing people into competition and conict. Freud used the knowledge he had learned
in his studies on psychoanalysis to address such major societal issues. He presented his ideas in books such
as

The Future of an Illusion

(1927/1961) and

Civilization and its Discontents

(1930/1961), and he hoped

that by advancing our knowledge of the human psyche we could help to continue the development of the
human species and civilization. The recognition that problems like these still plague humanity suggests that
we have a long way to go. But brilliant men like Sigmund Freud have helped to provide us with a basis for
moving forward.

3.1 Basic Concepts
It is not easy to read the earliest writings of Freud on psychoanalysis.

Following his years of working in

The Interpretation of Dreams (1900/1995),
Three Contributions to the Theory of Sex (1905/1995), and

isolation, Freud published four books in a span of 5 years:

Psychopathology of Everyday Life (1904/1995),
Wit and Its Relation to the Unconscious (1905/1995).

Each of these books clearly reects their author: a

genius, educated in Europe, and writing in a style well suited to the late 1800s/early 1900s. Not only are
these books intellectually challenging, but even the English translations are sprinkled with lines in German,
French, and Latin. In 1917, however, Freud published a series of lectures he had given at the University
of Vienna during the years 1915-1917. His

Introductory Lectures on Psycho-Analysis

(1917/1966) describes

the essential aspects of his theory in neatly organized lectures that are much easier to grasp than his earlier
work. Shortly before he died, Freud presented a very brief outline of his theories in the aptly named

Outline of Psycho-Analysis

An

(1938/1949). In what seems to be a logical approach to the study of Freud's

work, we will begin with the general theory and then address the psychoanalytic method. Keep in mind,
however, that Freud actually worked the other way around: rst he developed his modications of Breuer's
cathartic method and began treating patients (actually, treating patients contributed to his development
of the methods), and then he developed his theoretical perspectives in order to explain what had already
proved successful.

Hysteria and Psychic Determinism
The term

hysteria generally refers to a condition in which psychological trauma or stress is converted

into physical symptoms and/or excessive emotional behavior. Today, this condition is typically referred to
as a

conversion disorder (DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Society, 2000). However, Freud meant to

use the term in a rather broad sense, and he applied it to a collection of disorders that are not ocially
recognized today: the

neuroses (relatively mild mental illnesses, often associated with stress, but which do

not result in a loss of contact with reality).
Freud and Breuer (1895/2004) believed that their clinical observations revealed a number of key elements
that provided the early framework for

psychodynamic theory and psychoanalysis. In each case, the

symptoms exhibited by their patients were connected to some earlier psychological trauma. This connection
was not always obvious, however, and often could not be remembered by the patient.

When the patient

was helped to remember the traumatic event, the symptoms were typically relieved, a process known as

catharsis. In order to help patients remember, Breuer and Freud (as well as Charcot and a few others)
relied primarily on hypnosis. What intrigued Freud and Breuer was the observation that these traumatic
memories seemed to last for a very long time without getting weaker, even though they were not conscious
memories. What seemed to matter most was whether there had been an energetic reaction to the emotional
event when the memory was formed. In order for the trauma to be released, there needed to be a cathartic
event strong enough to adequately dissipate the energy associated with the formation of the traumatic
memory.
Both Freud and Breuer recognized that this was only the beginning of this new eld of clinical research.
Although they were somewhat satised that they had described the nature of hysterical symptoms, and that
they had moved further than Charcot, they recognized that they were no closer to understanding the internal
causes of hysteria and the neuroses. This would become the work of Freud alone, at least for a number of
years.
The concept of

psychic determinism arises naturally from these early observations. Freud believed

that all behavior and thought is the result of psychological connections created during previous experiences,
nothing happens by accident or chance. The fact that we might nd it dicult to recognize the connections
between some emotion or behavior and a previous incident does nothing to minimize the reality of those
connections, it just presents a challenge for the psychoanalyst. In

Psychopathology of Everyday Life,

Freud

(1904/1995) described how psychic determinism results in many common problems, certainly the most famous
of which is the  Freudian

slip. A Freudian slip is an instance where someone says something wrong, but

it actually reects the persons true feelings. Freud attributed the following example to Dr. Brill:
While writing a prescription for a woman who was especially weighed down by the nancial burden of
the treatment, I was interested to hear her say suddenly: Please do not give me

pills.

(italics in the original, pg. 50; Freud, 1904/1995)

Discussion Question: Consider psychic determinism and what it means for your own life. Do you
believe that

everything

you think and do is predetermined by earlier experiences?

And what would that

mean for your ability to change and grow?

Freud's Theory of Instincts
Freud used the term instinct in a way that does not t with the technical term instinct as dened
by Tinbergen (see Beck, 1978). It has been suggested that the German word
translated as instinct, and actually referred to something more like a

drive

trieb should not have been
impulse. Freud was not

or

concerned with specic behaviors, but rather with general categories of behavior.

As a former scientist,

Freud never left his interests in biology behind. When Freud referred to the psyche, or mind, he considered
both its physical elements, the brain and the rest of the nervous system, and its mental elements, primarily
our consciousness (which is made possible by the structure and function of the brain).

Given our basic

biological nature, and our genetic make-up, we inherit basic instincts essential to our survival: both our
individual survival and the survival of our species.

In recognition of the general rule in nature that all

systems are comprised of opposing forces (attraction and repulsion) Freud hypothesized a life instinct and a
death instinct.
Freud gave the life instinct the name

Eros. Each organism has available to it energy to act within
libido. Libido has been mistakenly associated

its environment. The energy associated with Eros is called

with the concept of a sexual impulse. What Freud was really referring to was a general survival impulse,
both individual and species survival.

While it is true that the survival of our species depends on sexual

reproduction, there are many aspects of our behavior that are not directly related to sex. For example, we
might have many friends, but our sexual interests are typically limited to only a few (it is our culture that
encourages us to limit our interests to only one person). From an evolutionary perspective, of course, friends
and others within our social group helped to protect us from predators and enemies. Similarly, the love and
care we provide for our children are essential to the survival of our species, but are not usually associated
with sexual acts. Incest appears to be one of the most common cultural taboos, and Freud found this to
be a fascinating observation amongst primitive societies, which could not be expected to know anything of
Western ideas of morality (Freud, 1913/1995). So it becomes apparent that the impulse to survive, Eros and
its associated libido, involves many types of behavior, of which sexual intimacy is just one.
Libido is limited. We have only so much energy to devote to the many aspects and responsibilities of our
lives.

Cathexis refers to the attachment of libidinal energy to some psychical phenomenon. This is what

Freud and Breuer meant by an energetic reaction to some experience. When we are attracted to someone,
we connect some of our libidinal energy to that relationship. That energy is no longer available to us for
other relationships, or to deal with the daily stress of our lives. If we have previously connected libidinal
energy to some traumatic event, which might require a great deal of libidinal energy, it may prove dicult
to maintain the level of energy we desire for our new relationship. As a result, that relationship, indeed all
of our relationships, may suer.
Although the libido is limited, it has the important characteristic of mobility (Freud, 1938/1949).

In

other words, it can switch from one task to another as necessary. At least, that is how it is supposed to work
under normal conditions. Sometimes, however, problems arise, such as the failure to satisfy the needs that

continued normal development and the individual's ability to live a healthy adult life.
Freud also proposed a destructive instinct, which is sometimes referred to as the death instinct.

The

energy associated with the death instinct is aggressive, but Freud never gave names to either the death
instinct or its associated aggressive energy.

This was never an important aspect of Freud's theories, but

he did address it in some detail in the book

Beyond the Pleasure Principle

(Freud, 1920/1961).

In this

book, Freud makes one thing very clear: the life instinct is far more inuential than the death instinct. The
primary role of the death instinct is protective. This may sound strange, but he considered the developing
organism, even well before birth, as a fragile being assailed on all sides by threatening stimuli (both external
stimuli and internal psychical stimuli). The death instinct creates a shell of inert tissue (guratively, if not

51

also literally), which protects the developing organism from harm.
Although Freud did not include the death instinct among his major concepts, other psychologists have.
The

neo-Freudian theorist Melanie Klein found evidence of the death instinct in the aggressive fantasies

of children, and Wilhelm Reich's concept of armoring is reminiscent of Freud's description of the theoretical
shell protecting the developing organism.

Regarding aggression itself, there are many dierent forms, in-

cluding predatory aggression, self-defense, defense of one's young, learned aggression, etc. The noted animal
behaviorist and Nobel Laureate Konrad Lorenz wrote extensively on aggression, and he proposed a very
Freudian perspective in which instinctive aggressive energy builds up and lashes out, unless an opportunity
for catharsis arises rst (see Beck, 1978).
At rst it might seem strange that Freud suggested the role of the death instinct is to create a protective
shell around the core of the developing nervous system, but the important question is whether we can nd any
evidence of it. Daniel Goleman, in

Emotional Intelligence (1995), suggests a similar theory.

The primitive role

of emotion is evident in the brain regions devoted to emotion, which are common to many species other than
humans. As the mammalian brain evolved, structures were added to the reptilian brain, culminating in the
neocortex of the cerebral hemispheres. The cerebral hemispheres are necessary for the cognitive functions
that are characteristic of humans.

Still, we retain the emotional structures that developed rst, and our

rational thoughts can easily be hijacked by emotional reactions (Goleman, 1995, 1998). Perhaps the most
important brain region involved in the processing of emotional information is the

amygdala. Jerome Kagan

has suggested that if the amygdala is overly sensitive a child will avoid external stimuli, leading to a life of
shyness, and vice versa (cited in Goleman, 1995). The development of brain structures that process emotion
and allow for cognitive processing well beyond the primitive and most basic emotions sounds very much like
what Freud had proposed regarding the role of the death instinct. This is not to suggest that either the
amygdala or some portion of the neocortex is the anatomical location of the death instinct, but the evidence
that such functions exist within the brain lends support to Freud's concept.

According to Goleman, the

ability to work with emotional intelligence is essential to one's well-being in life, and fortunately emotional
intelligence can be trained and strengthened (Goleman, 1995, 1998).

Discussion Question: Compare Freud's concept of a life instinct and a death instinct, and consider
the choices you make in life. Do you make choices that provide an opportunity to grow and change, or do
you get caught up in pointless, even self-defeating, activities? If you make bad choices, where do you think
those choices come from?

The Development of Libido and Psychosexual Function
Freud's most controversial theories related to sexual function and its role in personality development.
Even more controversial than that initial statement was his suggestion that the sexual life of every person
begins at birth. It is important, of course, to remember that Freud did not mean intimate sexual behavior
when he talked about sexual impulses, but rather a general life impulse. He made an important distinction
between sexual and genital.

By sexual he was referring to a wider concept of obtaining pleasure from

dierent regions of the body, whereas genital refers to the act of reproduction, which comes into play following
puberty.
Freud was well aware of this controversy during the early days of psychoanalysis, and many of his books
make a special point of defending the theory of infantile sexuality. As mentioned in the biography, he actually
attributed the initial observations of the role of sexuality in the development of neuroses to Breuer, Charcot,
and Chrobak (Freud, 1914/1995).

As he reected on the history of psychoanalysis, Freud described how

he and others before him had not intended to address infantile sexuality, but it proved unavoidable after
extensive experience with psychoanalysis. In other words, Freud kept encountering infantile sexuality, and
eventually he concluded that it was both universal and far too important to ignore. Therefore, he felt he
could not allow old prejudices against recognizing or discussing the relevance of sexuality to interfere with
the development of psychoanalysis (see Freud, 1938/1949).
Freud also defended his theory of sexuality in logical ways.

Contributions to the Theory of Sex

In his initial work on this topic,

Three

(1905/1995), Freud specically argued against the prevailing views that

sexuality develops at puberty for the purpose of attracting a man and a woman to each other for the ultimate
purpose of reproduction. He noted that there are individuals who are attracted to members of their own

sex, that there are those who engage in sexual acts that disregard the genitalia (e.g., fetishes), and there are
undeniable examples of children who become interested in their genitalia and obtain some excitation from
them. Finally, in his

Introductory Lectures. . .

(Freud, 1917/1966) he declared his position quite clearly:

To suppose that children have no sexual life  sexual excitations and needs and a kind of satisfaction 
but suddenly acquire it between the ages of twelve and fourteen, would (quite apart from any observations)
be as improbable, and indeed senseless, biologically as to suppose that they brought no genitals with them
into the world and only grew them at the time of puberty. (pg. 385).

Levels of Consciousness
From the very beginning of psychoanalysis, Freud and Breuer (1895/2004) recognized that their patients
were often unaware of the connections between their symptoms and earlier traumatic events, and they
might not even recall the events themselves.

And yet, as described above, the memory of those events

remained strong. How can a memory be strong but not remembered? The answer lies in the theory that
there are dierent levels of consciousness. Freud described three levels of consciousness: the

conscious, the

preconscious, and the unconscious.
The conscious mind is our awareness, the knowledge that we exist and are alive. As you read this book you
are conscious of it, when you talk to a friend you are aware of what they are saying and how you will respond
(unless, of course, you respond with a Freudian slip!). Although the conscious mind is usually identied with
our personality, and Freud recognized that people viewed consciousness as nothing more or less than the
dening characteristic of the mind, his clinical experience with psychoanalysis made it impossible for him to
accept the identication of the conscious mind with the mental mind (Freud, 1917/1966).
The unconscious mind, according to Freud, is the true psychic reality, and all conscious thought has a
preliminary unconscious stage. And yet, the unconscious mind is truly inaccessible. In

of Dreams (1900/1995), Freud wrote about the unconscious mind that:
. . .in its inner nature it is just as much unknown to us as the reality

The Interpretation

of the external world, and it is just

as imperfectly communicated to us by the data of consciousness as is the external world by the reports of
our sense-organs. (pg. 510)
How then does the unconscious mind aect our personality?
minds there is an intermediary: the preconscious.

Between the unconscious and conscious

Technically, the preconscious mind is part of the un-

conscious, but only through the preconscious mind can the impulses arising in the unconscious enter into
our conscious awareness. Freud distinguished between the two by theorizing that the unconscious cannot
enter into consciousness, but if certain rules are followed, the preconscious can enter into consciousness (but
perhaps only after being censored; Freud, 1900/1995).
Freud also made two important points regarding these levels of the mind. First, the unconscious, preconscious, and conscious minds are not located in dierent regions of the brain. Instead, the level of consciousness
of any particular psychical phenomenon depends on the cathexis of libidinal energy (or perhaps energy related to the death instinct) and repression (see

Anxiety

and

Defense Mechanisms

below). If the memory

of a traumatic event is signicantly repressed, it will remain in the unconscious, if not, it may enter into
consciousness through the preconscious.
structure of the brain.

Yet it has remained the same memory within the same memory

Freud also distinguished between the mind and reality, particularly between the

unconscious mind and reality. He did, however, remind his readers that they would do well to remember
that psychic reality is a special form of existence, though not to be confused with material reality (Freud,
1900/1995).

Structure of Personality
It is no accident that our discussion of the
of the levels of consciousness. In

id, ego, and superego follow immediately after our discussion

The Ego and the Id (which also discuss the superego, despite not including it

in the title; Freud, 1923/1960), Freud begins with a chapter on consciousness and what is unconscious, then
follows with a chapter on the ego and the id, and then a chapter on the ego and the superego. It is dicult
to discuss the two concepts, levels of consciousness and the

psychical apparatus (a term Freud used for

the id, ego, and superego), without intertwining them. In addition, these three structures begin as one, the
ego develops from the id, and later the superego develops from the ego. As with levels of consciousness, it
is inappropriate to think of the id, ego, and superego as actual structures within the brain, rather they are

constructs to help us understand the psychodynamic functioning of the mind. Freud acknowledged this
lack of understanding, and went so far as to say that even if we could localize them within the brain we
wouldn't necessarily be any closer to understanding how they function (Freud, 1938/1949).

Id, Ego, Superego
The oldest aspect of the psyche is the id, which includes all that we inherit at birth, including our
temperament and our instincts. The only goal of the id is to satisfy instinctual needs and desires; therefore,
it acts according to the

pleasure principle. It knows nothing of value judgments, no good, no evil, and

no morality at all. It does not change or mature over time. According to Freud, there is nothing in the id
except instinctual cathexes seeking discharge (Freud, 1933/1965). The energy associated with these impulses,
however, is dierent from other regions of the mind. It is highly mobile and capable of discharge, and the
quality of the discharge seems to be disregarded. This is a very important point, because it means that the

CHAPTER 3. SIGMUND FREUD

54

id does not need to satisfy its desires in reality. Instead, they can be satised through dreams and fantasy.
Because the id demands satisfaction, and knows nothing of restraint, it is said to operate as a primary
process. Since it can be satised in unreal ways, if we examine phenomena such as fantasies and dreams
we can uncover the nature of the id.

It was during his studies on dream-work that Freud developed his

understanding of the primary process of the id (Freud, 1923/1960).

Actually, we can only know the id

secondary
process structure in order for the mind to interact with the external world. This structure is found in the
through psychoanalysis, since it exists entirely within the unconscious mind. Therefore, we need a
ego.
The ego arises from the id as an intermediary between the id and the external world. The ego functions
according to the

reality principle, and tries to bring the external world to bear on the impulses of the id.

In other words, as the id demands satisfaction it is hindered by the reality of our environment, our societal
and cultural norms. The ego postpones satisfaction until the time or the circumstances are appropriate, or
it may suppress the id impulses altogether (Freud, 1938/1949). Freud believed that the ego is associated
with perception (of reality), in the same way that the id is associated with instinct. The id is passionate,
whereas the ego represents reason and common sense. But the id has the energy, the libido, to demand its
satisfaction in some way, and the ego can only derive its energy from the id.

Freud likened the ego to a

horseback rider on a horse named id. The rider cannot always control the far more powerful horse, so the
rider attempts to transform the will of the horse as if it were the rider's own will (Freud, 1923/1960).
The ego develops in part because it is that portion of the mind impacted by sensory input from the external
world. Therefore, it resides partially in the conscious mind, and must serve three tyrannical masters: the
id, the external world, and the superego (which we will discuss below). The goals of these three masters
are typically at odds with one another, and so the ego's task is not an easy one (Freud, 1933/1965). The
ego approaches this task by monitoring the

tension that exists within the mind. This tension arises from

internal and external stimuli making demands upon the mind, lowering this tension is felt as pleasurable,
and increasing the tension is unpleasant.

The id demands immediate reduction of tension, in accordance

with its pleasure principle, whereas the ego seeks an appropriate reduction of tension, in accordance with
its reality principle. A key point, of course, is that the ego also seeks pleasure. It does not try to deny the
impulses of the id, only to transform or delay them. But why does the ego even bother to do that? There are
times when pursuing pleasure can get us in serious trouble, but there are also times when we make choices
because they seem right to us. These decisions, based on justice, morality, humanism, whatever term you
choose, are mediated by the superego.
According to Freud, the superego is heir to the

Oedipus complex (which we will discuss below), and

arises as the child abandons their intense attachment to their parents. As a replacement for that attachment,
the child begins to identify with their parents, and so incorporates the ideals and moral values of their parents
and, later, teachers and other societal role models (Freud, 1933/1965). According to this view, the superego
cannot fully develop if the child does not resolve the Oedipus complex, which, as we will discuss below,
cannot happen for girls (Note: In addition to further discussion below, the issue of a more balanced female
psychology will be discussed again in later chapters). The superego functions across all levels of the conscious
and unconscious mind.
The superego takes two forms: an

ego-ideal and a conscience. Freud considered the term ego-ideal

as an alternative to the term superego, and it is not until we incorporate the development of conscience
that we can recognize ego-ideal and conscience as dierent aspects of the superego.
more appropriate, if one reads

The Ego and the Id

Indeed, it might be

carefully (Freud, 1923/1960), to consider the ego-ideal

and conscience as consecutive transformations of that portion of the ego that becomes known in general
as the superego. The development of the superego is a complicated process, and seems to derive from the
development of the ego itself.

For an infant, the attachment to the parents and identication with them

is not recognized as something dierent.

The ego is weak, and can do little to restrain the id.

As the

child grows, the erotic nature of the love for the mother is slowly transformed into identication; the ego
grows stronger, and begins to become associated with being a love-object itself. When the ego is capable of
presenting itself to the id as an object worthy of love, narcissistic libido is generated and the ego becomes
fully formed (Freud, 1923/1960).

In other words, the child becomes an individual, aware that they are

separate from their parents. There is still an intense attachment to the mother, however, which stems from
the early days of breast feeding. The child must eventually lose this intense attachment to the mother, and
begin to more fully identify with either the father (for boys) or the mother (for girls). As noted above, this
nal transformation from attachment to identication should occur during the Oedipus complex, and the
ego-ideal arises within the context of the child knowing I should act like my father (for boys) or I should
act like my mother (for girls).
Although the ego-ideal could represent the culmination of development, Freud believed that one more
step came into play. Because of the diculty the child encounters during the loss of the intense, erotic desires
of the Oedipus complex, Freud felt there was more than simply a residue of those love-objects in the mind.
He proposed an energetic
concepts of I must

not

reaction-formation against the earlier choices. Now, the child incorporates

act like my father or mother. Under the inuences of authority, schooling, religion,

etc., the superego develops an ever stronger conscience against inappropriate behavior. This conscience has
a compulsive character and takes the form of a categorical imperative (Freud, 1923/1960). This conscience
is our knowledge of right and wrong, and early on it is quite simplistic. There is right and there is wrong
(as with Kohlberg's earliest stages of moral development; Kohlberg, 1963).

Discussion Question: Do you feel that your behavior is being driven by the unconscious impulses of the
id? Do you believe that your moral development (your superego) is the result of internalizing your parent's
views of what is right or wrong? How close are your values to those of your parents?

Anxiety
We have already taken a look at the challenge faced by the ego in trying to balance the demands of the id,
the superego, and the external world. What happens when the demands of these conicting elements become
too much for the ego to deal with? Simply put, we get scared, we experience fear and
that there is some impending danger.

anxiety as a signal

Only the ego can experience anxiety, even if the underlying cause

begins with the id or superego. Anxiety arises primarily from libido that has not been utilized. For example,
if we are frustrated from fullling some id impulse, such as needing to go to the bathroom in the middle
of a great movie, the libido cathexed to that impulse grows.

This creates tension and the corresponding

unpleasant feelings. As the id demands satisfaction, but the ego cannot gure out how to satisfy the id (and
you really don't want to miss the good part of the movie), the fear arises that the id will satisfy itself. Most
of us would consider the possibility of going to the bathroom in our pants while at a movie a real danger
to our self-esteem, and we could be arrested if we simply went to the bathroom right there in the movie
theater. As the ego is reduced to helplessness in its inability to nd a reasonable outlet for the impulse of
needing to go to the bathroom, anxiety serves the useful and important purpose of warning the ego that the
impulse

must

be satised in order to avoid the danger (Freud, 1926/1959). And in support of Freud's view

regarding our sexual nature, who would deny the great pleasure felt upon nally getting to the bathroom?
Freud described three general types of anxiety. Realistic anxiety involves actual threats to our physical
safety. It is similar to fear, in that there is a real and external object that could harm us, but it diers from
fear in that we may not be aware of a specic danger. For example, after the famous book

Jaws

(Benchley,

1974) was made into a movie (the kind of movie that you don't want to miss the good scenes) many people
became anxious about swimming in the ocean, even though there were no specic sharks for them to fear.
Still, there are sharks in the ocean, so it might be reasonable to experience some anxiety. Sometimes we
are anxious about a real danger, but the anxiety we experience is completely out of proportion in relation
to the threat. This suggests that there is an element of neurotic anxiety accompanying the realistic anxiety
(Freud, 1926/1959).
Neurotic anxiety generally arises from an internal danger, the threat that unacceptable id impulses will
break through and be acted on by the individual.

The ultimate danger that exists is that we really will

be harmed as a result of our actions. Therefore, Freud considered there to be a close association between
neurotic and realistic anxiety (Freud, 1926/1959).

For example, if we are being harassed by a bully, our

aggressive id impulse might be to respond by killing this bully.

Of course, that could result in going to

prison or having the bully's friends kill us. So the anxiety that our violent id impulse might break out and
inuence our behavior is associated with the real danger posed by the consequences of that behavior, if it
should happen to occur. Therefore, our neurotic anxiety is composed, in part, of our internalized realistic

anxiety.
In a similar way, moral anxiety arises from conict between our ego and the constraints imposed on it
by the superego. Since the superego arises from the internalization of our parent's teaching us what is or is
not appropriate behavior, we again have an association between the internal threat of the superego and the
real, external threat of being punished by our parents. Therefore, as with neurotic anxiety, the precursor
to our moral anxiety is realistic anxiety, even if our fears are based on our psychological impressions of a
situation as opposed to an actual danger (e.g., the fear of castration; Freud, 1926/1959, 1933/1965). Freud
(1933/1965) described the relationships this way:
Thus the ego, driven by the id, conned by the super-ego, repulsed by reality, struggles to master its
economic task of bringing about harmony among the forces and inuences working in and upon it; and we
can understand how it is that so often we cannot suppress a cry: `Life is not easy!' If the ego is obliged to
admit its weakness, it breaks out in anxiety  realistic anxiety regarding the external world, moral anxiety
regarding the super-ego and neurotic anxiety regarding the strength of the passions in the id. (pgs. 97-98)
Freud also described an overall pattern to the development and expression of anxiety and its useful role in
life. In early childhood we experience traumatic situations in which we are helpless. Remember that Freud
believed that psychic reality is every bit as signicant as actual reality (Freud, 1900/1995), so the nature
of these traumatic events is subject to individual perception. As the child's capacity for self-preservation
develops, the child learns to recognize dangerous situations. Rather than waiting passively to be threatened
or harmed, an older child or an adult will respond actively. The initial response is anxiety, but anxiety is a
warning of danger in anticipation of experiencing helplessness once again. In a sense, the ego is recreating
to the helplessness of infancy, but it does so in the hope that now the ego will have at its command some
means of dealing with the situation. Therefore, anxiety has hopefully transformed from a passive response
in infancy to an active and protective response in later childhood and/or adulthood (Freud, 1926/1959).

Discussion Question: What makes you anxious, and how do you respond to those feelings?

Defense Mechanisms
We will cover

defense mechanisms only briey in this chapter. Although Freud talked about a wide

variety of defense mechanisms during his career, he left it to his daughter Anna to literally write the book
on

The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defense

two defense mechanisms:

(Anna Freud, 1936/1966). Freud himself discussed primarily

repression and regression. The recognition of these defense mechanisms was

essential to the development of psychoanalysis, and they are the only two defenses mentioned by Freud in

The History of the Psychoanalytic Movement

(1914/1995). The purpose of these defense mechanisms is to

protect the ego during the early years of life, when the ego has not adequately developed in its ability to
control the libidinal impulses of the id. Thus, defense mechanisms serve a useful function at rst, but later
prove inadequate when the re-animation of the sexual life is reinforced following puberty (Freud, 1938/1949).
Similarly, in adult life, defense mechanisms are useful in the short-term, but since they do not deal with
problems directly they must eventually prove inadequate.
Freud identied repression as one of the key elements establishing psychoanalysis as unique from the
cathartic method he had been working on thanks to the contributions of Josef Breuer (Freud, 1914/1995).
Indeed, according to Freud, his own contributions that transformed Breuer's cathartic method into psychoanalysis were repression,

resistance, infantile sexuality, and dream analysis for the understanding of the

unconscious mind. The value of repression cannot be underestimated:
The theory of repression is the pillar upon which the edice of psychoanalysis rests.

It is really the

most essential part of it, and yet, it is nothing but the theoretical expression of an experience which can be
repeatedly observed whenever one analyses a neurotic without the aid of hypnosis. One is then confronted
with a resistance which opposes and blocks the analytic work by causing failures of memory. This resistance
was always covered by the use of hypnosis; the history of psychoanalysis proper, therefore, starts with the
technical innovation of the rejections of hypnosis. (pg. 907; Freud, 1914/1995)
The resistance Freud is referring to here is the defense mechanism of repression, which is the means by
which the ego refuses to associate itself with an unacceptable instinctual impulse generated by the id. The
ego is able to keep the reprehensible impulse from entering into the conscious mind (Freud, 1926/1959).
But an important question arises:

What then happens to this impulse seeking satisfaction?

There are

57

several possibilities, and Freud himself considered the answer to be rather complex. One thing that might
happen is that the ego attempts to shift the libido cathexed to the impulse toward release as anxiety (Freud,
1926/1959). However, anxiety is unpleasant, and the id demands satisfaction in accordance with its pleasure
principle.

Therefore, this procedure is doomed to failure (and, therefore, the development of neurosis).

There are, of course, alternatives that can occur prior to the failure of this initial defense. The ego may nd
some acceptable alternative to the impulse through the other defense mechanisms, such as

sublimation or

reaction-formation.
Regression can be seen when an individual engages in behavior typical of an earlier stage of development.
As Freud and Breuer tried to work out the causes of their patient's neuroses by using the cathartic method,
they repeatedly found that they could not help their patients by focusing on the actual event that had led
to a crisis.

Instead, their patients inevitably made associations between the traumatic event and earlier

experiences. Initially, these earlier experiences went back to puberty, and ultimately they went back to early
childhood. Although Breuer favored some physiological explanation of this phenomenon, Freud insisted that
it was psychological, and he termed the process regression (Freud, 1914/1995). According to Freud:
This regressive direction became an important characteristic of the analysis. It was proved that psychoanalysis could not clear up anything actual, except by going back to something in the past. (pg. 903)

3.2 Psychosexual Stages of Development
Above, we examined the basic development of libido and psychosexual function. Freud also believed that
psychosexual function developed in a series of stages that occur in two waves. The rst three stages occur

pregenital phase (Freud, 1905/1995). There is then a latency period, which lasts until puberty, after which
the nal stage, the genital stage, is realized and the individual is capable of physically mature reproductive
during early childhood, from infancy to about the age of 5. Freud referred to this early period as the

functioning. These stages are typically presented as if they are exclusive and sequential. Although it is true
that they are sequential, they are not entirely exclusive. Therefore, it is possible for the stages to overlap
(Freud, 1938/1949). However, it remains true that during a particular stage one region of the body will be
dominant, and most of the libido will be focused on that region (see Jarvis, 2004). For the sake of simplicity,
we will treat the stages as if they occur one after another.

The Psychosexual Stages
oral stage. According to Freud,
erotogenic zone, and this lasts for approximately

The rst phase of psychosexual development begins at infancy with the
the mouth is the rst region of the body to become an

the rst year of life. During this time the mouth makes libidinal demands on the mind. In other words, the
region of the mouth demands that the mind direct adequate libidinal energy to satisfy the desires of the oral
region. Although this serves the purpose of sustaining the infant by satisfying its nutritional needs, Freud
believed that the infant's persistent sucking belied a need for satisfaction that was far greater than simply
taking care of physiological needs. He believed that the infant needed to satisfy its desire for psychological
pleasure independent of nourishment, and this was the basis for arguing that the behavior was sexual (in
the larger, life-oriented perspective on sexuality).
Evidence for this stage is easy to see, and such commonplace observances contributed to Freud's thinking.
Infants suck almost continuously, even when not being fed. They suck their thumbs, they can be comforted
with paciers, as they become older they put everything they can get their hands on into their mouths. If
they cannot satisfy this need, they may become xated in the oral stage. As a result of this oral xation, when
an older child or adult becomes frustrated or overwhelmed, they may regress and engage in oral behavior.
This occurs because the xation of libido on the oral region during infancy results in a deciency of the
libidinal energy needed to cope with some stressful period of adulthood. This oral behavior can take many
forms, such as: overeating, smoking, drinking too much (of course, this usually refers to drinking alcoholic
beverages), or just talking excessively.
During the second stage of psychosexual development, the

anal stage, the anus becomes the focus of

the libido, and the child derives pleasure from the ability to both retain and expel feces.

Initially, the

pleasure associated with evacuating the bowels is felt within the child, something Freud referred to as the

CHAPTER 3. SIGMUND FREUD

58

autoerotic nature of sexual development (Freud, 1917/1966). Soon, however, the child learns that the world
can be an inhibiting place, that greater pleasure can be derived only if the child defecates when and where
others consider it to be appropriate. This realization occurs as a result of the most signicant parent-child
interaction during this stage of development: toilet training.

If the parents are either too strict or begin

too early the child may develop the traits of an anal character (Jarvis, 2004). These traits include excessive
orderliness, stubbornness, and parsimony, each of which results from denial of the child's anal pleasure during
toilet training. Orderliness, or tidiness, serves as a denial of taking pleasure in defecating, and stubbornness
carries over from the child's assertion of their right to defecate at will (Jarvis, 2004). Parsimony, or being
stingy, stems from the child's association of the feces with money. According to Freud (1917/1966):
He feels no disgust at his feces, values them as a portion of his own body with which he will not readily
part, and makes use of them as his rst `gift,' to distinguish people whom he values especially highly. (pg.
390)
Freud was by no means unaware of how strange this part of his theory seemed. Immediately following
the above quote, he went on to say the following, and remember that his

analysis

Introductory Lectures on Psycho-

were actual lectures delivered to students at the University of Vienna:

I know you have been wanting for a long time to interrupt me and exclaim: `Enough of these atrocities!
You tell us that defecating is a source of sexual satisfaction, and already exploited in infancy! That feces
are a valuable substance and that the anus is a kind of genital! We don't believe all that. . .' No, Gentlemen.
You have merely forgotten that I have been trying to introduce the facts of infantile sexual life to you in
connection with the facts

...

that for a large number of adults, homosexual and heterosexual alike, the anus

does really take over the role of the vagina in sexual intercourse? (pg. 391)
So Freud was simply trying to address very real issues that he, and others, had observed in their clinical
practices. His years of working in isolation had prepared him for dealing with disapproval, and he was not
going to be shy about studying things that might make others uncomfortable.
The

phallic stage, in which the libido focuses on the genitalia, represents the culmination of infantile

sexuality.

Although it typically occurs between the ages of 3 to 5 years old, it sets the stage for adult

sexuality. Therefore, it is a very important period. According to Freud (1905/1995), this stage will leave
behind the profoundest (unconscious) impressions in the person's memory; if the individual remains healthy
they determine his character and if he becomes sick after puberty, they determine the symptomatology of

castration complex and
penis envy, and the second is the Oedipus complex. Technically, the Oedipus complex subsumes castration

his neurosis. There are two critical aspects of this stage: the rst involves the
anxiety, but it is important to consider these aspects separately.

of Sex

In

Three Contributions to the Theory

(Freud, 1905/1995), the book that obviously focuses on the sexual aspects of psychoanalysis, Freud

discussed the castration complex and penis envy, but not the Oedipus complex. Although he discussed the
Oedipus legend in his earlier books, he did not use the term Oedipus complex until 1910 (see Jarvis, 2004).
The other reason for considering the major aspects of this stage separately is the dierence between boys
and girls.

Penis envy is obviously something that only girls can experience and, according to Freud, the

Oedipus complex is something that only boys can experience.

Girls experience something similar to the

Oedipus complex, but their eorts are in vain, and this has a permanent, negative eect on their character
(Freud, 1938/1949). For more discussion on the latter point, see the section below on Freud's perspective
on the female psyche.
As we begin to address the castration complex and penis envy, it is important to realize that Freud's
phallic stage is entirely focused on the penis, for both boys and girls. As the libido becomes focused on the
genitals, a boy begins to manipulate his penis.

He experiences no shame, and even enjoys displaying his

body (Freud, 1905/1995). As a counterpart to this joy in his own sexuality, children are often curious about
seeing other children's bodies. This creates a very dierent experience for boys and girls. When boys see
a girl's body, they believe the absence of a penis means that the girl has been castrated. This leads to a
fear of the same thing happening to them, and creates castration anxiety, which in adulthood can lead to
a castration complex. When girls see a boy's body they are fully prepared to recognize the penis, and they
become envious of it. Indeed, this envy can become strong enough that the girl wishes she was a boy (Freud,
1905/1995). Since she cannot be a boy, she begins to seek an alternative, either her father or a child of her

own.
As Freud continued to develop his theory of the phallic stage, he included a broader perspective beyond
the castration complex: the Oedipus complex. A boy's rst love object is his mother, the one who feeds
him and attends to all of his needs. This is only natural. As his libido becomes focused on his genitalia,
however, this takes on the sexual desire that became so controversial. Keeping in mind that Freud did not
believe that children understand the adult reality of their desires (much of it is unconscious), he described
their behaviors as obvious evidence of their desire: boys talk about loving and marrying their mother, they
persistently pursue being in her presence when she is dressing, they want to be in bed with her at night,
etc. (Freud, 1917/1966). This eventually leads to conict with the father, and with it the castration anxiety
described above. Since there is no satisfactory resolution, given that the father is much more powerful than
the child, the boy is compelled to give up the Oedipus complex, to repress it. In the healthiest condition, the
Oedipus complex is completely destroyed in the id, and gives rise to a severe superego (Freud, 1933/1965).
This repression, or destruction, of the Oedipus complex allows the boy to transition into the latency period.
For girls, the Oedipus complex takes a very dierent course. A girl's rst love object is also her mother,
since again it is the mother who provides most of the childcare.

Once the girl realizes that she does not

have a penis she develops penis envy, and she must undertake a change in her love object to her father, the
one who can provide her with the desired penis. The mother is then seen as a rival for the father's penis,
and indeed as someone who has already received all that the girl wants from her father. This can intensify
feelings of hostility toward the mother. Consequently, she may enter into the Oedipus complex feeling that
it is a refuge or safe haven.

However, the girl does not fear castration, since she has no penis to begin

with, and without the fear of castration leading to repression of the Oedipus complex there is no motivation
for the girl to move into the latency period (Freud, 1933/1965).

Freud believed that girls remain in the

Oedipus complex, and thus the phallic stage, for an indeterminate period of time, and that they cannot ever
completely resolve it. Adding one more point of controversy, the only way in which girls can shift from an
initially masculine situation (the mother as love object) to a feminine situation (the father as love object) is
if they replace their penis envy with the desire for a child, given the ancient symbolic equivalence between
the penis and giving birth (Freud, 1933/1965).
Following the oral, anal, and phallic stages there is a period of latency, during which progress is at a
standstill.

There are, however, some interesting things that happen during this period.

The child knows

that they are still incapable of procreation (even though this knowledge may be unconscious), so they begin
to turn away from their sexual desires. They begin to view sexual impulses with disgust and shame, and
to consider them immoral (Freud, 1905/1995). Although their education has much to do with this, Freud
believed that it is also a natural occurrence. To compensate, the child (or the child's mind, as this again may
be entirely unconscious) engages the defense mechanism of sublimation: the conversion of the unacceptable
sexual impulses into activities that are socially acceptable (such as school work or sports). Another important
consequence of this mental activity is that we forget our infantile sexual impulses, something Freud called

infantile amnesia. Infantile amnesia is critical to the whole theory of the development of neuroses and the
technique of psychoanalysis (Freud, 1938/1949), and it is one of the main reasons that many adults insist
upon denying the possibility of infantile sexuality in the rst place.
With the onset of puberty, the individual enters the nal stage of psychosexual development: the genital
stage. If the challenges of the earlier stages have been resolved in a satisfactory way, the individual is nally
capable of appropriate and mature intimacy and sexual behavior. All of the psychodynamic processing that
has taken place is not gone, however. According to Freud (1938/1949), even normal people have some of
the following factors included in their nal psychosexual organization: some libidinal cathexes are retained,
others are taken into sexual activity as preliminary acts (such as foreplay), and still others are excluded from
the organization either by repression or sublimation.

Freud's Perspective on the Female Psyche
I would like to begin this section by being fair to Freud. First and foremost, there were no other theories
on the development of personality for Freud to consider as he developed his own theory. Second, most of the
patients Freud saw were women, and apparently he needed to explain how it was that so many of his patients
were women and not men. There were certainly other possible explanations than those oered by Freud,

but it has been easy for others to look back and criticize him with the benet of new and dierent ideas.
One must also keep in mind that Freud was a basic scientist for many years, and he put a lot of emphasis on
details. It is an undeniable, biological fact that men are male and women are female! Freud believed that
psychology could never truly understand sex and gender dierences unless we could understand why so many
species exists as two dierent sexes in the rst place (Freud, 1933/1965). Nonetheless, having acknowledged
this, Freud's theory does, unfortunately, describe women as the products of an incomplete and frustrated
male development.
Freud believed that the development of the feminine psyche was more dicult and complicated than that
of the masculine psyche for two main reasons, neither of which is faced by boys during their development.
Initially, there are basic biological dierences, both anatomically and in terms of temperament. Girls are
typically less aggressive, deant, and self-sucient; they also seem to have a greater need for aection, and as
a result become more dependent and pliant. However, Freud disregarded these dierences, feeling that they
were insignicant compared to individual dierences between boys and girls (Freud, 1933/1965). Through
much of the rst wave of infantile sexuality, particularly the oral and anal stages, there is no dierence
between boys and girls. Even during the early portion of the phallic stage there is no dierence between
the sensations boys experience via the penis and the sensations girls experience via the clitoris. The rst
dierence, however, arises from the need for girls to shift the focus of their libido from the clitoris to the
vagina, particularly with regard to the importance of the latter for sexual activity leading to procreation.
The second dierence is the need for the girl to shift the focus of her libido from the mother to the father as
she enters the Oedipus complex. This shift in the love object is not easy, and the outcome is not pleasant.
Freud proposed that the young girl's attraction to her father at the beginning of the Oedipus complex
is not simply a shift in the libido, but involves a rejection of the mother who had been the previous love
object. The girl's rejection of her mother is accompanied by hostility, and can end in hate. The hate can be
profound and last the girl's entire life, even if it is carefully compensated for later in life (Freud, 1933/1965).
The reason for this hostility toward the mother arises from the castration complex and penis envy. Whereas
a boy fears being castrated, the girl believes that she already has been, and the mother is responsible. The
girl then develops an overwhelming desire to have a penis, the so-called penis envy, but it simply cannot
be. Even when a girl is old enough to understand the basic biology of sex dierences, she still retains an
unconscious feeling of having been wronged and a considerable cathexis of libido remains (Freud, 1933/1965).
It is interesting to note that Freud acknowledges that it is dicult to see these processes in action if one
simply observes young girls. However, in his clinical practice he saw patients whose neuroses amplied these
processes, and following psychoanalysis the underlying basis of this developmental stage seemed evident to
Freud.

Table 3.1

How then is a girl to resolve the Oedipus complex and achieve a healthy, adult personality? As described
above, she can't! In Freud's own words:
The girl, after vainly attempting to do the same as the boy, comes to recognize her lack of a penis or
rather the inferiority of her clitoris, with permanent eects on the development of her character; as a result
of this rst disappointment in rivalry, she often begins by turning away altogether from sexual life. (pg. 26;
Freud, 1938/1949)
In these circumstances the formation of the superego must suer; it cannot attain the strength and
independence which give it its cultural signicance, and feminists are not pleased when we point out to them
the eects of this factor upon the average feminine character. (pgs. 160-161; Freud, 1933/1965).
Another important observation that came to Freud in his early psychoanalytic practice was the recognition
that almost all of his female patients reported having been seduced by their fathers (which, if true, is an
inaccurate way of saying they were sexually assaulted by a child molester).

This led Freud to propose a

seduction theory, which was the basis for rst proposing the role of sexual trauma in the development
of neuroses.

This sexual trauma did not have to be as severe as rape, but it was considered signicant

nonetheless (see Jarvis, 2004). Later, however, Freud came to the conclusion that these seductions occurred
only in the fantasies of the young girls. Indeed, Freud described the fantasy of a young girl being seduced
by her father as the typical expression of the Oedipus complex in women (Freud, 1933/1965). Freud was
criticized for theorizing that young girls fantasized about being seduced by their fathers, and Breuer ended his
pursuit of understanding sexual trauma when faced with the same conclusion (Freud, 1914/1995). Today,
however, Freud is criticized more for having turned away from what may have been his most startling
discovery, the prevalence of sexual abuse (see Jarvis, 2004).

Connections Across Cultures: Male/Female Dierences
We don't normally think of men and women as being dierent cultures, but this has become a more
popular approach to understanding their dierences (e.g., see Brislin, 2000; Ferraro, 2006a; Haviland, 2005;
Matlin, 2004). As we consider gender dierences it is, of course, important to avoid stereotyping individuals.
Nonetheless, the reality of cultural expectations related to sex and gender, some of which have a basis in
the development of the human species, has led to some interesting research in both professional and popular
psychology.

As mentioned in Chapter 1, psychology has often been portrayed as a discipline focusing on

White, European males. However, research on the psychology of women continues to expand, it has begun
to address the specic dierences of women of color, and it has led to the establishment of specic men's
studies as well (Matlin, 2004). The latter point is an important one, since the earlier emphasis on White
males was more circumstantial than intentional. For our purposes, I would like us to consider some of the
interesting popular work on male/female dierences.

This book openly addresses the dierent ways in which men and women typically communicate

and express their emotions. He oers practical advice on how men and women should react, or perhaps not
react, to one another in everyday interactions. In his introduction to the paperback edition, Gray (2004)
emphasizes how important it is

not

to try changing your partner. To expect members of the opposite sex

to become more like yourself sends a message that they are not good enough as they are.

He also notes

that not all men or women will fall into the typical gender roles, so it is important not to stereotype. What
is important, according to Gray, is that we recognize the general dierences that exist between men and
women and keep them in mind when we communicate with each other. If we can, then hopefully we can
avoid conicts that need not be inevitable. It might sound simple, but Gray clearly struck a chord in couples

Bestsellers like the original. There is an interesting website (www.marsvenus.com), there are workshops and
counseling centers based on Gray's work, and workplace seminars based on

Mars and Venus in the Workplace

(2002). Clearly, relationship problems based on the dierences between men and women are of great interest
to people in our society today.

As harshly as Freud has been criticized for his views on the dierences

between men and women, he was certainly on to something. Perhaps that's part of the reason why even
those who criticize Freud continue to talk about him.
More recently, Norah Vincent (2006) spent 18 months masquerading as a man, and then wrote about
her experiences in

Self-Made Man.

Ms. Vincent spent a substantial amount of time working to look and

act like a man. She consulted a professional make-up artist (especially to help with her beard), a voice
coach, and a personal trainer to help her build muscle mass in her arms and shoulders. She even went to a
sex shop and purchased a prosthetic penis, just to help make sure that her appearance was as convincing as
possible. Using the name Ned, she then traveled around the country, to ve dierent states, and attempted
to pass for a man in a variety of settings. She played on a men's bowling team, went to strip clubs with
other men, spent time in a monastery, got a job as a salesman, and joined a men's group.

One of the

most interesting aspects of her masquerade involved dating. Curiously, it was not really dicult for her to
consider dating women, because she happens to be a lesbian. But she was not prepared for how often she
would be rejected when trying to meet women!

Maybe that's why she wrote: It was hard being a guy.

Really hard. In fact, she found the entire experience quite disturbing. As a woman, she had always been
viewed as very masculine. But when pretending to be a man, she was seen as very eeminate. She felt that
her masculinity was constantly being judged, both by men and women. And the constant pressure to be a
real man was overwhelmingly stressful. As she concluded her book, talking about the camaraderie of the
men on the bowling team, she observed that:
Making this removed comforting contact with men and feeling the relief it gave me as my life as a man
went on was not a sign of having joined the overclass, for whom superiority is assumed and bucking up
unnecessary. It was more like joining a union. It was the counterpart to and the refuge from my excruciating
dates, which were often alienating and grating enough to make me wonder whether getting men and women
together amicably on a permanent basis wasn't at times like brokering Middle East peace.

I believe we

are

that dierent in agenda, in expression, in outlook, in nature, so much so that I can't

help almost believing, after having been Ned, that we live in parallel worlds, that there is at bottom really
no such thing as that mystical unifying creature we call a human being, but only male human beings and
female human beings, as separate as sects. (pgs. 281-282; Vincent, 2006)
As an indication of how popular this topic continues to be, shortly after Ms. Vincent published her book
she was interviewed on the popular news/comedy show The Colbert Report on Comedy Central. I guess it's
important to keep smiling as we struggle through the many challenges of male/female relationships.
Freud's perspectives on women have created a great deal of negativity toward him and his theory, particularly among women. But should we judge Freud so harshly? It was common in the society in which he lived
to consider women as the weaker sex. In his practice, most of the patients he saw were female, so he needed
his theory to explain why most of the people with psychological disorders were women (at least, that's what
he thought). Granted he had made fundamental errors by not realizing that men might be avoiding help for
psychological problems because of the culture and by not recognizing that women might be suering from
oppression caused by men, but since there were no other theories to compare his own ideas to, it is easy to
condemn him. However, those theorists who began to address the cultural issues, like Adler and Horney, had
Freud's theory for comparison. Horney in particular also had a growing body of research on anthropology
and sociology to draw on. So as much as Adler and Horney may have disagreed with Freud, he still laid the
foundation for their work and the work of many others.

3.3 Psychoanalysis
Most psychologists today make a distinction that Freud seldom, if ever, made. We refer to all theoretical
perspectives related to the views of Sigmund Freud as psychodynamic theories, reserving the term psychoanalysis for the therapeutic method developed by Freud. Freud simply referred to both his theories and his
therapy as psychoanalysis. This may well have resulted from the fact that Freud began as a therapist, and
only developed his theories in order to explain why certain approaches worked and others did not. It may
also have something to do with the fact that Freud's personality theories came rst, and so there was no
need in his mind to distinguish his views from the work of others. Whatever the reason, for our purposes we
will use the term psychoanalysis to refer to the therapeutic method developed by Freud, which was uniquely
dierent from the techniques already in use by people such as Breuer and Charcot.

I would also like to

note that many of the references in this section cite the book co-authored by Freud and Breuer (1895/2004).
However, the citations come from a portion of the book written by Freud alone, and in which he takes
personal credit for the work. Therefore, we need to acknowledge that although the book is published as the
work of both men, it contains mostly each man's individual work, and only the Preliminary Statement is
co-authored by Freud and Breuer. This point is by no means a small one, because it was at this point in
their careers that the two men went their separate ways.
As mentioned above, Freud came to believe that the use of hypnosis, which had been championed by
Breuer and Charcot, was unable to get at the root causes of patient's neuroses. He also learned through
experience that psychoanalysis could only be eective if he was able to go back into the early childhood of his
patients and uncover the unconscious conicts and repressions that led to their neurotic behaviors. In order
to accomplish this goal, Freud relied primarily on

free association and dream analysis. In the history of

psychoanalysis, there have been those who believed that psychoanalysis ocially began when Freud rejected
hypnosis and introduced free association (Freud, 1914/1995). Free association is often used, of course, during
the interpretation of dreams, so the two techniques are not mutually exclusive. With regard to the value of
interpreting dreams, Freud wrote perhaps his most famous line:  . . .the interpretation of dreams is the

regia [royal road] to a knowledge of the unconscious element in our psychic life.
Free Association  Freud's Therapeutic Breakthrough

via

(pg. 508; Freud, 1900/1995).

Free association grew out of a need that resulted from problems implementing Breuer's cathartic method.
The rst problem was that many patients could not be hypnotized. With the patients that Freud could not
hypnotize, especially those who would not even allow him to try hypnotizing them, Freud tried a technique
of pressing them to remember. This technique also came up short, and Freud recognized a need to work

65

around the patient's resistance (which we will examine in more detail below). The rst technique that Freud
developed involved pressing his hand against his patient's forehead and asking them to say whatever thought,
no matter how seemingly irrelevant, came rst into their consciousness (Freud & Breuer, 1895/2004). Freud
himself described this technique as a trick, one that disconnects the patient's attention from his conscious
searching and reecting. However, trick or not, Freud found the technique to be indispensable. The thoughts
that came to the forefront of consciousness, those believed to be easily accessible via the preconscious, were
likely to be connected to the underlying associations responsible for the neurotic patient's symptoms. Freud
used this technique of free association quite successfully. As early as 1892, he treated a patient known as
Fräulein Elisabeth von R. by relying entirely on free association (Freud & Breuer, 1895/2004).
Still, Freud did make some modications in the technique. Two other methods used to begin the free
association were to have the patient think of a number or a name at random.

Of course, Freud did not

believe that it was possible for anything in the mind to occur at random, and by continuing the association
brought up by that rst name or number, Freud could help his patient to arrive at the true unconscious
associations that were the root of their problems (Freud, 1917/1966). He also used free association during
the interpretation of dreams, and often found it helpful to examine which part of the dream the patient chose
to begin making free associations (Freud, 1933/1965). Freud also considered psychoanalysis to be eective
with children, but cautioned that a child's lack of psychological development limited their ability for free
association. Other psychodynamic theorists worked more extensively with children, however, including Adler,
Anna Freud, and Klein.

The Elements of Dream Analysis
For someone who considered dreams to be the royal road to the unconscious mind, it is no surprise that
Freud's rst book of his own was

The Interpretation of Dreams

(Freud, 1900/1995). The value of this work

never diminished, and Freud devoted a chapter to dream interpretation in one of his last books:

of Psycho-Analysis

(Freud, 1938/1949).

An Outline

In the latter book, published only a year before Freud died, he

wrote:
The only thing that can help us are states of conict and uproar, when the contents of the unconscious
id have a prospect of forcing their way into the ego and into consciousness and the ego puts itself once more
on the defensive against this invasion.

. . .Now,

our nightly sleep is precisely a state of this sort, and for that

reason psychical activity during sleep, which we perceive as dreams, is our most favourable object of study.
In that way, too, we avoid the familiar reproach that we base our constructions of normal mental life on
pathological ndings; for dreams are regular events in the life of a normal person. . . (pg. 38)
Freud described our recollection of a dream as a façade, a covering that hides the underlying process
of the dream. Thus, a dream has both

manifest content and latent content. The manifest content (or

the dream-content) of a dream is what we actually remember when we wake up.

The latent content (or

the dream-thoughts), however, is the true underlying meaning of the dream, the unconscious material from
the id desiring satisfaction. Freud described the process by which the latent content is transformed into the
manifest content as the

dream-work (Freud, 1900/1995). Studying the nature of the dream-work, the way

in which the unconscious material from the id forces its way into the ego but is transformed by the ego's
opposition to the impulse, allows us to understand what is known as

dream-distortion (Freud, 1938/1949).

The importance of dream-distortion becomes clear when we consider the purpose of dreams. Freud believed
that all dreams represent our true desires. Therefore, all dreams can be viewed as wish fulllment. Although
some dreams can be very anxiety-provoking, and certainly do not seem to represent our wishes and desires,
this is the result of the distortion. If we successfully analyze the dream and identify its latent content, then
Freud believed we would recognize the true wish-fulllment nature of even anxiety-provoking or frightening
dreams (Freud, 1900/1995).
When we sleep, the ability of the ego to repress or otherwise redirect the unacceptable impulses of the
id is paralyzed. The id, then, is aorded a harmless amount of liberty (Freud, 1938/1949). But the ego is
still the seat of consciousness, and still exerts some inuence over the expression of the id impulses. And so
the dream is distorted, transformed into something less threatening to the ego, particularly into something
not threatening enough to wake the person up. To summarize this situation, when we are asleep the ego is
less able to restrain the id. Consequently, the impulses of the id intrude in the preconscious and then into

CHAPTER 3. SIGMUND FREUD

66

the conscious mind. This provokes anxiety and threatens to wake us up. However, the dream transforms
the id impulse into the fulllment of a wish, and we are able to continue sleeping. As Freud described it:
We shall be taking every experience into account if we say that a dream is invariably an attempt to get
rid of a disturbance of sleep by means of a wish-fulllment, so that the dream is a guardian of sleep. (pg.
46; Freud, 1938/1949)
Does it seem reasonable to say that all dreams are wish fulllment? Certainly some dreams clearly fulll
our wishes and desires, at least through fantasy. Such dreams do not require any analysis. Other dreams,
however, seem to make no sense at all. The id and the unconscious mind are not logical at all, contradictory
ideas easily coexist side by side, and Freud even referred to the unconscious mind as the Realm of the
Illogical (pg. 43; Freud 1938/1949). As these latent impulses are transformed into manifest content, it can
be very dicult to separate them and make sense of a given dream. The dream-work itself, the very process
of distorting or transforming the latent content into the manifest content in order to disguise the meaning

condensation, displacement, the use of symbolic
representation, and secondary elaboration (Freud, 1900/1995).
of our dreams, involves a variety of factors, including:

According to Freud, condensation refers to the tendency to create unity out of a variety of dream elements
that we would keep separate if we were awake.
might represent a number of latent thoughts.
the dream itself.

So, a single element of the manifest content of a dream

Thus, the analysis of a dream could be much longer than

Displacement is not unrelated to condensation according to Freud, and refers to the

switching of libidinal energy from one object to another, such that the important object of a dream might
seem inconsequential, and vice versa. In other words, the apparent focus of the dream is probably not the
actual focus of the dream. This does not simply suggest that we might substitute one person for another
in a dream, it also happens that we might represent various elements through symbols. Once again, these
symbols are employed by dreams to disguise the representation of latent content. As important as Freud
considered symbols to be in a dream, he did not support the idea that dream dictionaries can identify
universal meanings of dream symbols. It is only through the associations relevant to a specic dreamer that
we can make sense of a dream's symbolism (Freud, 1938/1949). Finally, as the dream is actually presented
to the conscious mind, the ego ensures that the material is acceptable by performing what Freud termed the
secondary elaboration. As with any perception, the ego lls in gaps and connections, but also misunderstands
the true nature of the dream. As a result the secondary elaboration can oer little more than a smooth façade
for the dream. Also, the secondary elaboration may only be partial, or even absent (Freud, 1933/1965). All
of these processes together form the manifest content of the dream, resulting in something that might be
dicult to understand, but which is within the reach of a determined psychoanalyst.

Discussion Question: Have you ever analyzed your own dreams?

Were you able to discover any

revelations after considering a dream in greater depth, even though it made no sense at rst?

The Therapeutic Process
Initially, Freud began with a fundamental belief in the eectiveness of catharsis, the discharge of pent-up
emotion that follows the recall and re-experiencing of traumatic memories (see Jarvis, 2004). If only a patient
can recognize the unconscious association between an early traumatic event and their current symptoms,
then the symptoms should be relieved. As Breuer and Freud noted in the introduction to their book:
For we found, at rst to our great surprise, that the individual hysterical symptoms disappeared immediately and did not recur if we succeeded in wakening the memory of the precipitating event with complete
clarity, arousing with it the accompanying aect, and if the patient then depicted the event in the greatest
possible detail and put words to the aect. Remembering without aect almost always fails to be eective. . .
(pg. 10; Freud and Breuer, 1895/2004).
One can see from this description, however, that the process of psychoanalysis is not easy. There must
be a clear recognition of the initial traumatic event, in detail, with all of its original emotional impact, and
the patient must then be willing to talk about the event in relation to their current problems.
As we have already seen, the rst obstacle is resistance, the patient's reluctance to experience the anxiety
associated with recovering repressed material. The more severe the symptoms, the more severe the resistance
is likely to be. Even when a little trick is successful, such as pressing on the forehead to break the patient's
concentration and allow free association, in serious cases the self remembers its intentions (which are often

67

unconscious motives) and resumes its resistance (Freud & Breuer, 1895/2004). Because of this challenge,
Freud believed that the therapist must be patient. Resistance that has been constituted over a long period
of time can only be resolved slowly, step by step. In addition to the intellectual role of the therapist, there
is an important emotional role as well. In some cases, Freud found that only the personal inuence of the
doctor could successfully break down the patient's defense mechanisms.
A large part of the reason that psychoanalysis can be so dicult has to do with how the unconscious
mind exists. Freud believed that memory of a traumatic event exists as a pathogenic nucleus within multiple
layers of pathogenic psychical material of varying resistance. The outer layers may be easy to uncover, but
as one progresses into the deeper layers, resistance grows steadily. Adding to the challenge, the associations
between layers do not simply go deeper, they can travel at odd angles, in something of a zigzag fashion, or
branch out in multiple ways (Freud & Breuer, 1895/2004). Because multiple associations may exist between
a patient's neurosis and the underlying traumatic event, it is critical to address all of the psychical material
that comes to bear on the current condition of the patient. Even if the therapist rightly knows the basis for
the patient's problems:

. . .there

is no point at all in advancing directly to the nucleus of the pathogenic organization. Even if it

were possible for us to guess this, the patient would not know what to do with the elucidation given to him
and would not be altered by it psychically. (pg. 293; Freud & Breuer, 1895/2004)
As suggested above, a dierent kind of obstacle arises when the relationship between the doctor and
the patient has been damaged somehow.

Freud considered this to be a likely occurrence in serious cases

of analysis. Freud described three ways in which the doctor/patient relationship can suer. The rst case
involves the patient feeling estranged, neglected, undervalued, insulted, or if they have heard negative things
about the doctor. Freud considered this problem to be fairly easily handled through good communication,
although he noted that good communication can be dicult with hysterical patients. The second situation
involves patients who fear that they will become too dependent on the therapist and that they will lose their
independence. This can lead to new resistances. As an example, Freud described patients who complained
of headaches when he pressed on their forehead, but really they were just creating a new hysterical symptom
to mask their aversion to the belief that they were being manipulated or controlled. The nal problem that
commonly disturbs the relationship between the therapist and the patient is known as

transference (Freud

& Breuer, 1895/2004). Transference occurs when the patient reacts as if the therapist were an important
gure from the patient's childhood or past, and transfers onto the therapist feelings and reactions appropriate
to that person from the past. Although transference can interfere with the therapeutic process, it also oers
advantages. The power conferred on the therapist by transference aords him an opportunity to re-educate
the patient, correcting the mistakes of the parents, and it leads patients to reveal more about themselves
than they might have if they had not developed such a connection to the therapist (Freud, 1938/1949).
Following transference, it is also possible for

countertransference to occur. Countertransference refers

rst to an unconscious inuence of the patient on the therapist, after which the therapist directs their own
emotional states back onto the patient. In Freud's circle of analysts their own psychoanalysis was conducted
in large part to eliminate the inuence of this distorting eect. Today, there are some therapists who view
countertransference as a useful means to gain a deeper perception about what is going on in their patient's
mind (see Jarvis, 2004).

Is Psychoanalysis Eective?
The eectiveness of psychoanalysis as a treatment for psychological disorders has been a source of ongoing
debate. In 2006, a select task force, established by the presidents of ve major psychoanalytic organizations,
published the

Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual

(PDM Task Force, 2006). Included within the PDM is a

section on research, including meta-analytic studies on the eectiveness of psychoanalysis on patient populations in the United States (Westen et al., 2006), the United Kingdom (Fonagy, 2006), and Germany (Leichsenring, 2006). Each of these chapters emphasize the diculty in empirically evaluating the eectiveness
of psychotherapy, and even more so comparing the eectiveness of dierent psychotherapeutic approaches.
Nonetheless, for a variety of psychological disorders, there is evidence supporting the ecacy of psychoanalytic treatments. Both Fonagy (2006) and Leichsenring (2006) identify another area of research that needs
to be continued: there is

not

just one type of psychoanalysis. Thus, continued research on the ecacy of

68

psychoanalytic treatments should address the relative ecacy of dierent styles of psychoanalytically based
therapies.

3.4 Religion and Spirituality
In the last section of this book, we will look at spiritual philosophies that provide positive guidelines for
personal development and living one's life. Freud had rather strong feelings about religion, and simply put,
he did not approve! Freud actually considered religion to be an obstacle to the further development of civilization, and of the three powers that oppose a scientic worldview (art, philosophy, and religion), religion
alone is to be taken seriously as an enemy (Freud, 1933/1965). In his rst and last books reviewing psychoanalysis Freud makes almost no mention of religion (Freud, 1917/1966, 1938/1949), a rather conspicuous
absence. In between, however, he wrote two books thoroughly condemning religion and societies depending
on it.
In

The Future of an Illusion

(Freud, 1927/1961), Freud describes the role that religion has played in

establishing and maintaining inequitable civilizations. According to Freud, the primary purpose of civilization
is the gathering of wealth and, then, its distribution. This distribution is almost always unfair, and leads to
the establishment of a small group of wealthy elite and a much larger mass of lower classes. The challenge
for the wealthy elite is to maintain this unfair distribution, without the unreasonable use of force.

The

use of force will ultimately fail, since the instinctual demands for pleasure by the masses (driven by their
id impulses) will drive them to take whatever they want from each other and from the wealthy. And the
masses have power in numbers! Religion has served civilization by providing a controlling force over these
instinctual demands, incorporated directly into the psyche of each individual by means of the development
of the superego. The problem, however, lies in the fact (according to Freud) that there is no God, it is all
an illusion. Thus, in

Civilization and Its Discontent

(Freud, 1930/1961), Freud states that the religions of

mankind must be classed among the mass-delusions. . . that are used to provide people with a certain degree
of happiness and protection against suering, in spite of the reality of an unfair and uncertain world.
In his last completed book,

Moses and Monotheism

basis for Judaism and Christianity.

(Freud, 1939/1967), Freud atly rejects the entire

Based on archaeological evidence, Freud claims that Moses was not

Jewish, but rather an Egyptian. Furthermore, he argues that the monotheistic religion that provides the
basis for Judaism, Christianity, and Islam (the Abrahamic religions) was a discredited Egyptian religion
established by the pharaoh Amenhotep IV. When Amenhotep IV died, and Egyptians who still followed the
traditional religion of Egypt came back into power, Moses led the Jewish people out of Egypt so that he
would have followers to whom he could teach the religion he hoped to maintain. Since Moses was a hero to
the Jewish people, Freud claims that they rewrote the story to say that Moses was Jewish and that their
one true God had been revealed to them long before they entered Egypt (Freud, 1939/1967).
If religion is nothing more than an illusion, where does it come from, and what is the danger of it?
According to Freud, the development of religion is analogous to the development of each individual. Basically,
God is symbolic of our relationship with our own father.
1933/1965), Freud neatly lays out this relationship.

In his

New Introductory Lectures. . .

(Freud,

Religion serves to provide us with an understanding

of the origins of the universe and life, it oers us hope for protection and ultimate happiness, and it lays
down moral guidelines for living our lives. Similarly, our fathers give each of us life, they protect us when
we are young, and they teach the rules and morality of our culture. Although the establishment of religions
by our primitive ancestors may be quite understandable, Freud used rather harsh language when referring
to religion.

He wrote that  . . .our wretched, ignorant and downtrodden ancestors. . .  . . .were far more

ignorant than we are. . . (Freud, 1927/1961).

In his opinion, ancient religious books are the product of

fraud from a time when man's ignorance was very great. . ., and he includes the Bible and the Koran in
that category (Freud, 1933/1965). He considered religion to be the antithesis of science and art, the two
highest achievements of man (Freud, 1930/1961). Even when addressing more modern times, he compares
the political oppression by the Russian Bolsheviks, with its prohibition of thought (punishable by death), as
just as ruthless as was that of religion in the past. . .doubts of its correctness are punished in the same way
as heresy was once punished by the Catholic Church (Freud, 1933/1965). And in anticipation of his views

being challenged, Freud wrote that his considerations will impress only that minority of readers familiar
with analytical reasoning and able to appreciate its conclusions (Freud, 1939/1967).

The danger in all

of this, according to Freud, is what might happen if people become aware of this illusion and fraud.

If

people become aware that there is no God, if they discover that no one else believes, then there may be a
violent reaction as a result of the inherent hostility toward civilization by the masses (Freud, 1927/1961).
Accordingly:

. . .either

these dangerous masses must be held down most severely and kept most carefully away from

any chance of intellectual awakening, or else the relationship between civilization and religion must undergo
a fundamental revision. (pg. 39; Freud, 1927/1961)
And yet, in spite of such harsh condemnation of religion, Freud was at times fascinated by individuals
who expressed deep spiritual experiences. While in college, Freud was profoundly impressed by the religious
philosopher Franz Brentano, a former Catholic priest. Freud wrote to a friend that he could not refute any
of Brentano's theistic arguments, and he referred to Brentano as a remarkable man (cited in Nicholi, 2002).
Much later in life, Freud discussed an alternative to his earlier analysis of the basis for religion.
sent a copy of

The Future of an Illusion

He had

to a friend who was well versed in traditional Yoga. This friend,

named Romain Rolland, described for Freud an oceanic feeling, a sense of eternity and limitlessness.
Freud was unable to discover such feelings within himself, and expressed a general dissatisfaction with
scientic investigations of such phenomena. Today, however, neuroscientists are using real-time brain imaging
techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), to study the alterations in brain activity
unique to meditative states and, in particular, positive emotions (e.g., see Barinaga, 2003; Goleman, 1988,
2003; Mathew, 2001).

Although Freud obviously had no knowledge that such studies would someday be

possible, he did acknowledge that experiences like the oceanic feeling might form the basis for religious
sentiments in the human species (Freud, 1930/1961). Yet another friend encouraged Freud to practice Yoga,
particularly meditation, to experience these altered states of mind for himself. It is unclear whether Freud
ever attempted to meditate, but he does make mention of his friend's belief that meditation may reveal a
primordial state of mind, perhaps even deeper than that of the id and the unconscious with which Freud
had occupied his career (Freud, 1930/1961). Freud even went so far as to suggest that if we could somehow
achieve a complete reduction, an extinction, of the tension between our instinctual needs and the constraints
imposed by reality and the superego that we might achieve nirvana (Freud, 1938/1949).
How might we reconcile the seeming contradiction between Freud's harsh attitude toward religion with
his apparent fascination with mystical spirituality and deeply spiritual individuals?

Freud believed that

religion had failed society. Religion has ruled human civilization for thousands of years, and yet, We see
that an appallingly large number of people are dissatised with civilization and unhappy in it. . .In every
age immorality has found no less support in religion than morality has. . . (Freud, 1927/1961). Also, it is
undeniable that death awaits each of us, and Freud was denitely concerned with death. In 1909 Freud met
William James (Freud, 1952). James asked Freud to carry the bag James had with him and to walk on;
James said he would catch up after dealing with an attack of angina pectoris. James died of heart disease
a year later. Freud wrote that I have always wished that I might be as fearless as he was in the face of
approaching death. Freud was also concerned about how his own death might aect his mother, who lived
to a ripe old age. Martin Freud noted that Grandmother Amalia. . .looked for some time as if she would live
forever, and my father was terried by the thought that she might survive him and, in consequence, have
to be told of his death. (M. Freud, 1983). Perhaps we should not be surprised that someone who was so
thoughtful regarding death, someone who proposed a death instinct, might be inclined to have some concern
regarding what happens after one's life comes to an end.
As gloomy as Freud's perspective may seem at rst, he remained hopeful regarding the future of humanity.
He considered religion to have been just one step in the development of our species, and that science had
reached a point where it could move us ahead another step.

When addressing the belief of many people

that we were created in the image and likeness of God, a god who must also have created evil and the Devil
(other theologians have come to a dierent conclusion on this point; see, for example,

Mere Christianity

by C. S. Lewis [1952]), Freud suggested that we bow to the deeply moral nature of mankind, which has
overcome this diculty (Freud, 1930/1961). He acknowledged the positive role that religion has played in

redirecting and transforming some of our sexual impulses into impulses experienced as love.

Indeed, the

purpose of civilization itself is to serve Eros, the life instinct, by combining individuals into families, then
races, peoples and nations, into one great unity, the unity of mankind (Freud, 1930/1961). But the natural
aggressive instinct, the death instinct manifested as the hostility of the individual for civilization, opposes
the establishment of civilizations. Thus, the meaning of the evolution of civilizations becomes clear:
It must present the struggle between Eros and Death, between the instinct of life and the instinct of
destruction, as it works itself out in the human species.

This struggle is what all life essentially consists

of, and the evolution of civilization may therefore be simply described as the struggle for life of the human
species.

And it is this battle of the giants that our nurse-maids try to appease with their lullaby about

Heaven. (Freud, 1930/1961)

Discussion Question: Freud believed that religion has failed to resolve the diculties that many people
face, that it has outlived its usefulness, and that God is only an illusion anyway. Does this t with your
view of the world in which we live?

Personality Theory in Real Life:
The Things We Do Are Not Really Surprising!
It isn't dicult to apply Freud's theories to everyday life. Only a few years after publishing his landmark

Psychopathology of Everyday Life
Wit and Its Relation to the Unconscious (1905/1995). So Freud

book on dream analysis, Freud published

(1904/1995). One year later,

he published

clearly intended his theory to

address all aspects of life, and he was well aware that jokes and laughter are as much a part of life as any of
the darker aspects of psychoanalysis (with concepts such as demanding id impulses and the death instinct).
As mentioned earlier in the chapter, the most famous example of a simple, everyday psychopathology
is the famous Freudian slip. A very humorous example of a Freudian slip can be found on the Wikipedia
website (http://en.wikipedia.org): Excuse me, but I'm having doubts about your theories, Dr.

Fraud.

There are, of course, a variety of other mistakes we commonly make when we talk. We often forget names,
words, the order of phrases and sayings, and these errors can carry over into reading and writing as well as
speaking. Of course, Freud believed that these mistakes are neither random nor just the result of forgetfulness.
Rather, they represent psychological processes leading to the expression of one's real feelings and beliefs.
An interesting example that often comes to mind is a quote by former Vice-President of the United States
Dan Quayle. The Honorable Mr. Quayle intended to quote the slogan of the United Negro College Fund: A
mind is a terrible thing to waste. Instead, he said What a waste it is to lose one's mind. Since losing one's
mind is slang for becoming mentally ill, it might be argued by some that the vice-president had revealed a
negative attitude toward minority groups. We should always be very careful, of course, to avoid analyzing
situations with only the bare minimum of information.

Without the implication of the slang meaning of

losing one's mind and some alleged unconscious intentions, Vice-President Quayle's statement seems like
nothing more than a simple mistake. Haven't we all made mistakes like this that were very embarrassing
at the time? I don't know if it's good or bad, but Vice-President Quayle made a variety of other infamous
comments that can easily be found on the Internet, suggesting that his only issue was a penchant for making
mistakes in ordinary speech.

However, people seem to nd such mistakes quite interesting.

An Internet

search for embarrassing quotes will locate a wide variety of examples like the one above, but they are not
always attributed to the same person.

Some of the same embarrassing quotes have been attributed to

whoever happens to be the current political target of the person posting the webpage. So obviously a lot
of people enjoy the embarrassment of others, but be careful about attributing any quote you locate on a
random webpage.
Of course, any time a famous person like Vice-President Quayle makes that big a mistake, the late-night
comedians are all over it! And that brings us to

Wit and Its Relation to the Unconscious

(Freud, 1905/1995).

In this early book, Freud discussed jokes and witticisms in great detail. He actually considered wit-work,
the process of forming a joke or witty remark, as being essentially the same thing as dream-work. Thus,
the examination of how an individual uses humor on a daily basis might reveal a great deal about their
personality.

The following is one of the jokes Freud included in his book for analysis.

It takes a little

thought, since it is in a category that Freud referred to as sophistic faulty thinking (Freud described over 20
types of joke):

A gentleman entered a shop and ordered a fancy cake, which, however, he soon returned, asking for some
liqueur in its stead. He drank the liqueur, and was about to leave without paying for it. The shopkeeper
held him back. What do you want of me?

he asked. Please pay for the liqueur, said the shopkeeper.

But I have given you the fancy cake for it.

Yes, but you have not paid for that either.

Well, neither

have I eaten it. (pg. 634)
The next time you think of a really good joke or something really funny to say, or the next time you hear
a joke that really makes you laugh, take a minute or two to consider what that laughter might be saying
about who you really are.

3.5 A Final Note
An important aspect of Freud's theory is his belief that development occurs in a series of predictable stages.
This belief is not common to all of the theories we will cover in this textbook. Furthermore, stage theories
are likely to be inuenced by

cultural relativism, the perspective that the signicance of an idea or

concept is determined by how it is valued within a given culture.

Noted psychologists who have oered

such a developmental perspective include Vygotsky and Bronfenbrenner, and it has been suggested that an
approach incorporating cultural relativism may be of particular importance when studying the development
of African Americans and other minority groups (Belgrave & Allison, 2006; Howard-Hamilton & Frazier,
2005). For example, it has been noted that religion is a very important aspect of African American, Hispanic
American, and Asian American culture (Axelson, 1999; Belgrave & Allison, 2006; Taylor, Chatters, &
Levin, 2004), and we have just examined how little Freud cared for religious or spiritual matters.

Other

psychologists, however, gave signicantly more consideration to cultural inuences (e.g., Adler, Horney, and
the Stone Center Group). We will examine their contributions in later chapters.

3.6 Review of Key Points
•

Early in his career, Freud felt that hypnosis could not help to understand why hysteria developed or
why some patients got better with treatment.

Psychoanalysis grew out of his desire to understand

psychological processes better.

•

The terms hysteria and neurosis are no longer recognized as technical terms. Hysteria would commonly
be called a conversion disorder today, and the neuroses refer to a variety of disorders.

•

Catharsis refers to the release of pent-up emotion that occurs when a patient remembers a traumatic
event

•

Psychic determinism is the concept that all thoughts and behaviors have some basis in prior experience,
nothing happens by accident or chance.

•

Each person is driven by a life force known as Eros. The energy associated with this life force is called
libido.

•

Cathexis refers to the attachment of libido to some psychical phenomenon.

Since libido is limited,

experiencing numerous traumatic events can leave a person with limited resources to cope with normal
life.

•

Freud believed that individual development is driven by sexual impulses that begin at birth. However,
when Freud referred to sexual impulses he was really referring to the life force Eros.

•

Freud described three levels of consciousness: the unconscious, the preconscious, and the conscious
minds.

•

Personality has three basic components according to Freud: the id, the ego, and the superego. The
id is the oldest and most basic component, and the source of all sexual impulses and libidinal energy.
The id acts according to the pleasure principle.

•

The ego arises from the id, and acts according to the reality principle. It tries to balance the desires
of the id with the constraints of the superego and the real world.

CHAPTER 3. SIGMUND FREUD

72

•

The superego arises from the ego as we internalize the rules and customs of society. As it develops it
takes two forms: the ego-ideal and the conscience.

•

When we are conscious of the ego being unable to restrain the impulses of the id we experience anxiety.
The threat can be real, or primarily psychological. Freud emphasized that psychological reality can be
every bit as important actual reality.

•

When faced with anxiety, we resort to defense mechanisms. The defense mechanisms rst proposed by
Freud were repression and regression.

•

There are four psychosexual stages, separated by a latency period. The oral, anal, and phallic stages
occur during early childhood. Following the latency period and puberty, the genital stage represents
physically mature reproductive functioning.

•

During each psychosexual stage, a dierent region of the body becomes an erotogenic zone. The child's
recognition of these sexual feelings belies the autoerotic nature of sexual development.

•

The most dramatic development occurs during the phallic stage. It is in this stage that the Oedipus
complex occurs, with its potential for the castration complex or penis envy.

•

Infantile amnesia occurs naturally, according to Freud, and is the reason that we do not remember
these psychosexual processes from our childhood.

•

Freud's perspective on the development of girls has been problematic since its inception. He considered
the female psyche to be the result of an incomplete and frustrated male development.

•

Freud's initial contributions to therapy were the development of free association and dream analysis,
leading some to suggest that this was point when psychoanalysis was created.

•

In analyzing dreams, Freud distinguished between the manifest and latent content.

The dierence

results from distortion that occurs during the dream-work.

•

The analysis of a dream can be quite complex, since information might be condensed, displaced,
represented symbolically, and nally it all undergoes a secondary elaboration.

•

The challenge faced by a psychoanalyst is the nature of the unconscious mind. It exists as layer upon
layer with dierent degrees of resistance. Only through patience can the psychoanalyst overcome this
resistance and help the patient.

•

During the process of psychoanalysis itself the psychoanalyst may encounter transference and experience countertransference.

•

Freud acknowledged that religion had served a useful role in the history of humanity, but he rmly
believed that there is no God. He felt we have grown beyond the ignorance of our ancestors, and the
observations of psychoanalysis could explain how religion had arisen. He believed that the future of
humanity was being hindered by clinging to these ancient and meaningless beliefs.

Alfred Adler and Harry Stack Sullivan

Alfred Adler was an early member and president of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society, but he never considered himself a follower of Sigmund Freud. He strongly disagreed with Freud's emphasis on sexual desire in
the development of personality, focusing instead on children's striving for superiority and the importance of
social relationships. He began to address the psychology of women as a cultural phenomenon, as opposed
to Freud's view that women are fundamentally incapable of developing a complete and healthy personality.
Adler also addressed issues of education, an individual's unique perspective on the world, and family therapy. Adler provided a perspective in which the striving of individuals to improve themselves is an essential
characteristic of personality development.

Most importantly, he believed that personal improvement and

success are best achieved in cooperation with others, and that culture is an important factor in determining
how that can be accomplished.
It has been suggested that Adler may have had an even greater inuence on the overall development of
psychiatry and psychology than Freud himself, and that theorists such as Sullivan, as well as Karen Horney
and Erich Fromm, should be recognized as neo-Adlerians, not neo-Freudians (Ellis, 1973; Kaufmann, 1992;
Mosak, 1995; Watts, 1999). Indeed, a reviewer of one of Karen Horney's books once wrote that Horney had
just written a new book by Adler (see Mosak, 1995). Albert Ellis suggested that Adler set the stage for the
cognitive/behavioral psychotherapies that are so popular today (Ellis, 1973). Late in life, Adler encouraged
the wife of a good friend to write his biography, and he gave Phyllis Bottome, who was herself a friend of
Adler, a great deal of assistance (Bottome, 1957). He wanted to be understood. Perhaps, however, she came
to understand him too well:
Adler was at once the easiest of men to know, and the most dicult; the frankest and the most subtle;
the most conciliatory - and the most ruthless. As a colleague he was a model of generosity, accuracy and
wholehearted integrity, but woe betide that colleague who dared to presume upon his generosity; or who was
himself guilty of inaccuracy; or who failed in common honesty!
Adler never again worked with a person whom he distrusted; except when that person was a patient.
(pg. 13; Bottome, 1957)
Adler also had the ability to make an impression on people who did not know him.

When Raymond

Corsini, a well-known psychologist in his own right, was 21 years old, he was invited by a friend to hear
Adler speak at the City College of New York. During the question period that followed the lecture, an angry
woman called Adler stupid, and berated one of the observations he had discussed. The young Corsini shared
Adler's perspective, and Corsini looked forward to hearing Adler's crushing reply.

However, something

quite dierent occurred:
He seemed interested in the question, waited a moment, then in the most natural and careful manner,
completely unrued by her evident antagonism, spoke to her very simply. . .
He seemed so calm, so reasonable, so precise, and so kind, I knew we were in the presence of a great man,
a humble and kind person, one who repaid hostility with friendship. (pg. 86; Corsini cited in Manaster, et

al., 1977)
Harry Stack Sullivan extended Adler's focus on the individual and social interest, believing that each of
us can be understood only within the context of our interpersonal relationships. Like Freud, Sullivan focused
intently on developmental stages, though he recognized seven of them, and believed that the primary purpose
of development was to form better interpersonal relationships. In regard to his interest in relationships he
can be closely associated with Adler, who believed that social interest, and its resulting social interaction,
was the best way for an individual to overcome either real inferiority (such as in the case of a helpless
newborn) or feelings of inferiority that might develop as part of one's personality. Unlike Freud and Adler,
however, Sullivan was born in America. Thus, he should be considered one of the most important gures in
American psychology, particularly within the eld of psychodynamic theory.

Brief Biography of Alfred Adler
Alfred Adler was born on February 7, 1870, on the outskirts of Vienna. The second of six children, the
family was fairly typical of the middle-class. His father was a corn-merchant, and did well in his business.
While Adler while still quite young the family moved out into the country, where they kept cows, horses,
chickens, goats, rabbits, and they had a very large garden. Adler was particularly fond of owers when he
was a toddler, and the move out of Vienna had the consequence of protecting him from his bad habit of
stealing owers from the garden of the Palace of Schonbrunn, which belonged to the Kaiser! Despite the
seemingly idyllic setting, and the family's nancial comfort, Adler did not have a happy childhood. The two
main reasons for this were his sibling rivalry with his older brother and the unfortunate fact that he seemed
to be surrounded by illness and death (Bottome, 1957; Manaster, et al., 1977; Sperber, 1974).
His older brother seemed to be an ideal child, and Adler felt he could never match his brother's accomplishments. Even late in life, Adler told Phyllis Bottome with a sigh My eldest brother. . .he was always
ahead of me. . .he is

still

ahead of me! (pg. 27; Bottome, 1957). As for his younger brothers, however, one

felt the same sort of jealousy of Adler himself, whereas the youngest brother adored Adler. As for the illness
and death, he suered from rickets (a vitamin D deciency) and spasms of his vocal cords, both of which
made physical activity very dicult during his early childhood years. He was often forced to sit on a bench
while watching his older brother run and jump. As he recovered, he joined his brother and the other local
children in playing in a large eld. Despite the fact that there were very few vehicles at the time, and those
that were there moved very slowly, Adler was run over twice! Fortunately, he was not injured seriously. One
of his younger brothers, however, had died suddenly when Adler was 4, an event that deeply aected him.
And when Adler was 5, he came down with a serious case of pneumonia. After he had been examined by the
doctor, Adler heard the doctor tell his father that there was no point in caring for Adler any more, as there
was no hope for his survival. Adler was stricken with terror, and when he recovered he resolved to become a
doctor so that he might have a better defense against death (Bottome, 1957; Manaster, et al., 1977; Sperber,
1974).
On the lighter side, most of the family was musically gifted.

One of his brothers played and taught

the violin, and one of his sisters was an excellent pianist. Despite the throat problems Adler had in early
childhood, he developed a beautiful tenor voice. He was often encouraged to set aside his interest in science
and pursue a career as an opera singer. Adler's parents encouraged the musical interests of their children,
and took advantage of the marvelous musical culture available in Vienna at the time. Adler attended every
opera and play that was running, and even by the age of 4 years old could sing entire operettas (Bottome,
1957; Manaster, et al., 1977; Sperber, 1974).
Although Adler spent a great deal of time reading, he was not a particularly good student. His worst
subject was math, until he nally had a breakthrough one day. When the instructor and the best student in
class failed to solve a problem, Adler raised his hand. Everyone in the room, including the instructor, laughed
out loud at him. However, he was able to solve the problem. After that, he did quite well in math, and
overall he did well enough to enter the University of Vienna. He studied medicine, as he had planned since
being a young child, and graduated in 1895. Almost nothing is known of his time spent at the University
of Vienna. Afterward, he briey practiced ophthalmology, but then switched to general practice, a eld in
which he was very popular amongst his patients. He also became active in socialist politics, where he met
his future wife: Raissa Timofeyewna Epstein (Bottome, 1957; Manaster, et al., 1977; Sperber, 1974).

75

Raissa and Alfred Adler had three daughters and one son between the years 1898 and 1909. The family
lived rather simply, but they always had enough to meet their needs. Their daughter Alexandra and son
Kurt both became psychiatrists. Alexandra Adler described her relationship with her father as close and
positive, and she considered it a privilege to follow in his footsteps, whereas Kurt Adler said that everyone
in the family felt respected as an individual and that no one had to search for their identity (see Manaster,
et al., 1977).
In his general practice, Adler began to see psychiatric patients.

was happy. She was deeply oended, and left in a hu, but 2 months later she led for divorce. As he saw
more psychiatric patients, Adler treated each case as unique, and followed whatever therapy seemed most
appropriate for the particular patient. This was the beginning, of course, of Individual Psychology. Adler
was so popular in this regard that his biographer had the following experience herself when leaving a message
for Adler:
`Are you sure', she asked the clerk at the desk, `that Professor Adler will get this message directly he
comes in?' [sic] `Adler?' the clerk replied. `If it's for him you needn't worry. He always gets all his messages.
You can hardly keep the bell-boys or the porter out of his room. They'll take

any

excuse to talk to him,

and as far as that goes, I'm not much better myself !' (pg. 54; Bottome, 1957)
In 1900, Sigmund Freud gave a lecture to the Vienna Medical Association on his recently published
book

The Interpretation of Dreams

(Freud, 1900/1995). The audience was openly hostile, and Freud was

ridiculed. Adler was appalled, and he said so publicly, writing to a medical journal that Freud's theories
should be given the consideration they deserved. Freud was deeply attered, he sent his thanks to Adler, and
the two men met. In 1902, Adler was one of four doctors asked to meet weekly at Freud's home to discuss
work, philosophies, and the problem of neurosis.

These meeting evolved into the Psychoanalytic Society.

Adler and Freud maintained their cooperative relationship for eight years, and in 1910 Adler became the
president of the International Psychoanalytic Association and co-editor of the newly established

fur Psychoanalyse

Zentrallblatt

(with Freud as Editor-in-chief ). During the preceding 8 years, however, the dierences

between Freud and Adler had become increasingly apparent. By 1911 he had resigned from the both the
association and the journal's editorial board.

Although Freud had threatened to resign from the journal

if Adler's name was not removed, leading to Adler's own decision to resign from the journal, Freud urged
Adler to reconsider leaving the discussion group.

He invited Adler to dinner to discuss a resolution, but

none was to be found. Adler is said to have asked Freud: Why should I always do my work under your
shadow? (pg. 76; Bottome, 1957). The Psychoanalytic Society debated whether or not Adler's views were
acceptable amongst the members of the society. The no votes counted fourteen, and the yes votes counted
nine. Freud's supporters had won a small majority, and the nine other members left to join Adler in forming
a new society, which in 1912 became the Society for Individual Psychology (Bottome, 1957; Manaster, et
al., 1977; Sperber, 1974).
During the years in which Adler was still active in the Psychoanalytic Society he had begun his studies on
organ inferiority and the inferiority complex, and after the split with Freud he focused his career on psychiatry
(giving up his general medical practice). During World War I he served in the Army as a physician, and
he continued his observations on psychiatric conditions as he helped injured servicemen. Following the war
the Austrian Republic began to emphasize education and school reform.

Adler established his rst child

guidance center in 1922, and by the late 1920s there were thirty-two clinics in Vienna alone (as well as
some in Germany).

The clinics were intended to help train teachers to work with special needs children,

but Adler felt it was important to help the children themselves as well.

In 1930, Adler brought together

a number of his colleagues, including his daughter Alexandra, and published

Principles of Individual Psychology.

Guiding the Child: On the

This volume contains twenty-one chapters on the work being conducted

in the Vienna child guidance clinics (including one chapter by Adler, and two by his daughter; Adler, 1930a).
In addition, Adler taught at an adult education center and at a teacher training college. Adler continued
to be so popular that after a long day of work he would settle in at the Cafe Siller and carry on friendly
conversations until late at night.
In 1926, Adler made his rst visit to America. Becoming a regular visitor, he lectured at Harvard and

Brown Universities, in Chicago, Cincinnati, Milwaukee, and several schools in California. In 1929, he was
appointed a visiting professor at Columbia University, and in 1932 he was appointed as the rst chair of
Medical Psychology in the United States, at Long Island Medical College. All of his child guidance clinics
were closed when the fascists overthrew the Austrian Republic in 1934, and Alfred and Raissa Adler made
New York their ocial home. In the spring of 1937 he began a tour of Europe, giving lectures and holding
th

meetings. As he traveled to Aberdeen, Scotland on May 28

, he collapsed from a heart attack and died

before he reached the hospital.
One of the enduring questions about Adler's career was the nature of his relationship with Freud. As
mentioned above, it was the very popular Adler who defended Freud's early theories, and helped Freud to
gain recognition in psychiatry (remember that Freud was well known as an anatomist and neurophysiologist).
And yet, it is often suggested that Adler was a student or disciple of Freud. According to Abraham Maslow,
Adler was deeply oended by these suggestions:
I asked some question that implied his disciplineship under Freud. He became very angry and ushed,
and talked so loudly that other people's attention was attracted. He said that this was a lie and a swindle
for which he blamed Freud entirely. He said that he had never been a student of Freud, or a disciple, or a
follower. . .Freud, according to Adler, spread the version of the break which has since been accepted by all namely, that Adler had been a disciple of Freud and then had broken away from him. It was this that made
Adler bitter. . .I never heard him express personal opinions of Freud at any other time. This outburst must,
therefore, be considered unusual. (pg. 93; Maslow cited in Manaster, et al., 1977; see also Kaufmann, 1992)

Placing Adler in Context: Perhaps the Most Inuential Person
in the History of Psychology and Psychotherapy
To suggest that anyone may have been more inuential than Freud, let alone a contemporary of Freud, is
dicult to say. And yet, if we look honestly at the accomplishments of Alfred Adler, and the breadth of his
areas of interest, we will see that the case can be made. When Freud rst proposed his psychodynamic theory,
with its emphasis on infantile sexuality, Freud was often mocked, or simply ignored. It was the popular Dr.
Adler's defense of Freud, and Adler's favorable review of the interesting nature of Freud's theories, that
helped Freud nd an interested audience. As supportive as Adler was, he had his own theories from the very
beginning of their association, and Adler's Individual Psychology has a certain logical appeal, without the
corresponding controversy generated by Freud.
Infants are inferior, and we all try to gain control over our environments.

Thus, the basic inferior-

ity/striving for superiority concept seems self-evident. Likewise, the inferiority complex is one of the most
widely recognized and intuitively understood concepts in the history of psychology. Suggesting that each
person adopts a style of life that helps them to pursue their goals also again makes perfect sense, and the
suggestion that we have within us a creative power to form our style of life is a decidedly hopeful perspective
on the human condition.
Adler's inuence within the psychodynamic eld has been widely recognized, if not adequately advertised.
When he split with Freud, nearly half of the psychoanalytic society left with him. His emphasis on social
interactions and culture provided a framework within which theorists such as Karen Horney and Erich Fromm
ourished. Adler's emphasis on child guidance, and including school teachers as being just as important as
parents, must have had an important inuence on Anna Freud (though she would never have admitted it).
Within the child guidance centers, Adler was one of the rst (if not the rst) to utilize family therapy and
group psychotherapy, as well as school psychology. It was within such an environment, inuenced also by
Maria Montessori, that Erik Erikson evolved into the analyst and theorist he became.
Adler's inuence also extended well beyond the psychodynamic realm. His scheme of apperception set the
stage for the cognitive psychology and therapies that are so popular (and eective) today. He is recognized by
many as the founder of humanistic psychology, though it was Rogers, Maslow, and the existentialists Viktor
Frankl (Frankl worked closely with Adler for a time) and Rollo May who clearly split from psychodynamic
theory into new schools of psychology.
Given this extraordinary inuence, it is surprising that Adler is not widely recognized as belonging
amongst the greatest theorists and clinical innovators in the history of psychology and psychiatry.
honor is certainly well deserved.

The

77

Adler's Individual Psychology
Adler developed the concept of Individual Psychology out of his observation that psychologists were
beginning to ignore what he called the unity of the individual:
A survey of the views and theories of most psychologists indicates a peculiar limitation both in the nature
of their eld of investigation and in their methods of inquiry. They act as if experience and knowledge of
mankind were, with conscious intent, to be excluded from our investigations and all value and importance
denied to artistic and creative vision as well as to intuition itself. (pg. 1; Adler, 1914/1963)
To summarize Individual Psychology briey, children begin life with feelings of
parents, as well as toward the whole world.

inferiority toward their

The child's life becomes an ongoing eort to overcome this

inferiority, and the child is continuously restless. As the child seeks

superiority it creatively forms goals,

even if the ultimate goal is a ctional representation of achieving superiority. Indeed, Adler believed that it
is impossible to think, feel, will, or act without the perception of some goal, and that every psychological
phenomenon can only be understood if it is regarded as preparation for some goal. Thus, the person's entire
life becomes centered on a given plan for attaining the nal goal (whatever that may be). Such a perspective
must be uniquely individual, since each person's particular childhood feelings of inferiority, creative style of
life, and ultimate goals would be unique to their own experiences (Adler, 1914/1963).
The suggestion that seeking to overcome one's inferiorities is the driving force underlying personality
development is, of course, a signicant departure from Freud's suggestion that development revolves around
seeking psychosexual gratication. Another important dierence is that Adler did not distinguish between
the conscious and unconscious minds as Freud had:
The use of the terms consciousness and unconsciousness to designate distinctive factors is incorrect
in the practice of Individual Psychology.

Consciousness and unconsciousness move together in the same

direction and are not contradictions, as is so often believed.

What is more, there is no denite line of

demarcation between them. It is merely a question of discovering the purpose of their joint movement. (pg.
56; Adler, 1929a)

Inferiority and Compensation
In 1907, Adler published his classic

Study of Organ Inferiority and Its Psychical Compensation, which was

translated into English 10 years later (Adler, 1917). This was primarily a medical article on the consequences
of

organ inferiority, in which Adler looked at how the nervous system helped the body to adapt to physical

inrmities that resulted from, literally, inferior organ development. For example, it is often suggested that
people who are blind develop better hearing. However, social psychologists have demonstrated that the social
environment can profoundly aect our sensitivity to external stimuli. The reason for this is probably just
what Adler described as the primary means through which the brain can compensate for any deciency: by
bringing attention to the processes necessary for compensation. Thus, if a person has diculty seeing, they
pay more careful attention to hearing, as well as to the other senses. However, this is not a perfect system,
and it can also lead to over-compensation. As a result, a wide variety of physical symptoms can result from
the psyche's eorts (including unconscious eorts) to compensate for some problem.

As noted by Freud,

hysterical symptoms are typically manifested as physical problems. According to Adler, underlying these
physical symptoms, even when they are caused solely by the psyche, there must be some organ inferiority
within the body (Adler, 1917).
Adler did not limit his theory of organ inferiority to medical problems or neurotic symptoms, but rather,
he expanded the theory to incorporate all aspects of life.

Compensation refers to the typical manner in

which a person seeks to overcome challenges. For example, if one breaks their arm, they learn to function
with a cast, or if one loses their eyesight, they learn to use a cane or work with a seeing-eye dog (Dreikurs,
1950; Mosak & Maniacci, 1999). If we examine compensation in a more psychosocial realm, examples might
include a college student who cannot nd a suitable boyfriend or girlfriend so they focus on becoming a
straight A student, a student who does not do well academically focuses their eorts on becoming a star
athlete, or an only child who wished to have brothers and sisters has many children of their own (Lundin,
1989). In such instances, compensation leads to balance in one's life. A weakness, or at least a perceived
weakness, is compensated for in other ways (Manaster & Corsini, 1982).
compensation to extremes.

Overcompensation involves taking

dancer, or a person born in poverty strives to become a millionaire and then continues to work 80 hours a
week or more striving to become a billionaire. Generally speaking, the mechanisms of personality inferiority
are more complex than those of organ inferiority. Likewise, compensation and overcompensation are more
complex when they pertain to one's personality than when they involve physical challenges (Manaster &
Corsini, 1982).
When a person nds it dicult to overcome their challenges in life, they can develop what Adler called
an

inferiority complex (Adler, 1928, 1929a, 1931a). Although feelings of inferiority are universal, as is

the striving for superiority, people are not created equal. We all have dierent strengths and weaknesses.
However, when an individual cannot compensate for their weaknesses, and their feelings of inferiority overwhelm them, the inferiority complex arises. According to Adler, the term complex is not really accurate,
because the so-called inferiority complex is complicated, and it permeates the entire personality. And yet,
it may not always be obvious. An individual with an inferiority complex may feel comfortable in situations
in which they have enough experience to feel self-assured, although they may create those situations by
avoiding competition that might expose their weaknesses (Adler, 1929a). The inferiority complex will show
itself, however, in tense or dicult situations, and often takes the form of excuses as to why the individual
can't pursue a certain course of action. For psychologists, according to Adler, the presence of an inferiority
complex can typically be recognized by contradictions, by certain emotions such as doubt, and by generally
hesitant behavior. The proper treatment, therefore, is to encourage people, never to discourage them, and
to help them understand that they are capable of solving problems and facing the diculties of life (Adler,
1929a).
When the intense feelings of inferiority associated with the inferiority complex become too much to bear,
they can be transformed into a unique delusion that Adler described as the

superiority complex (Adler,

1928, 1929a, 1931a). The superiority complex should not be viewed as an extension of the normal process
of striving for superiority. The superiority complex arises out of the inferiority complex, and is actually an
extension of the intense feelings of inferiority. Interestingly, such people typically do not present themselves as
superior individuals, instead they may be arrogant, snooty, domineering, or they may cling to prominent and
important people. In contrast, people who truly are superior often have a sense of modesty (Lundin, 1989;
Mosak & Maniacci, 1999). The complexity of the superiority complex, and its origin in feelings of inferiority
and the continued striving for superiority that is universal can be seen not only in neurotic symptoms and
other forms of mental illness, but also in criminal behavior:
We see children who start stealing suering from the feeling of superiority. They believe they are deceiving
others; that others do not know they are stealing. Thus they are richer with little eort. This same feeling
is very pronounced among criminals who have the idea that they are superior heroes. . .he wants to arrange
matters so that he escapes the solution of the problems of life. Criminality is thus, the result of a superiority
complex and not the expression of fundamental and original viciousness. (pp. 80-81; Adler, 1929a)

Discussion Question: Adler believed that we all begin life with feelings of inferiority and then strive
for superiority. What sort of things have you tried to be really good at in life? Can you remember times
when you felt inferior trying to accomplish those same goals?

The Style of Life and the Life Plan
According to Adler, everyone faces diculties in life, and they strive to overcome those diculties. As
each individual faces their unique diculties, and strives to compensate in their own characteristic ways,
given the environment (or culture) in which they live, the individual develops a sense of meaning for their
life and they set a goal for their strivings. Initially Adler referred to the consistent movement toward this
overriding goal as a

life plan, but that term proved to be somewhat confusing. So, Adler chose instead to
style of life. The style of life unies the personality, as it is based on

refer to the pursuit of one's goal as the

one's early life experiences. However, Individual Psychology looks not to the past, but rather to the future.
If we know a person's style of life, we can predict their future actions (Adler, 1929a, 1931a).
It is not always easy to recognize the style of life, however, particularly in a psychologically healthy person
or during times of relative calm. It is when a person faces a new situation, or a new diculty, that the style
of life becomes clear to others. For the normal person, the style of life is a framework within which the person
is adapted to their society in such a way that the society benets from the work of the person and the person

themselves has the energy and courage to face any problems and diculties that arise (Adler, 1929a). The
style of life encompasses our individual creativity, the ways in which we solve problems and compensate for
inferiorities, our attitudes, opinions, and goals. It unies and expresses our personality, provides consistency
for how we live our life, and helps us to nd our place in the world (Adler, 1931a; Dreikurs, 1950; Lundin,
1989; Mosak & Maniacci, 1999).
The style of life is established fairly early in childhood, which can be a serious problem when it proves to be
a dysfunctional style of life. The inferiority complex is, of course, one faulty style of life. When an inferiority
complex arises out of an actual organ inferiority it can be particularly troublesome. Robert Lundin (1989)
described the case of a senior student he knew in college who was only 5' 3 tall (very short for a man, though
this would really only be a perceived inferiority). He was extremely arrogant and hostile toward younger
students, claiming to be intellectually superior in every regard. He even oered to be Lundin's roommate,
since Lundin obviously needed his help to improve Lundin's decient personality! Lundin declined the oer.
Adler noted that organ inferiority is not always a negative situation, and given the advances in prosthetic
devices that exist today, it is even truer now that organ inferiority does not necessarily diminish one's quality
of life. However, Adler emphasized that what matters most is how the individual

experiences

the weakness

of their organ inferiority. Some try to avoid or deny the problem, others constantly wrestle and struggle
with their diculties. In the end, it comes down to the creative power of the individual to adapt (see below;
Adler, 1932a/1964).
In addition to the style of life of that can result from organ inferiority (or perceived organ inferiority),
Adler discussed two other factors that commonly lead to dysfunctional styles of life, and which can be
attributed primarily to parental inuence:

pampering and neglect. The pampered style of life was of

particular concern to Adler. He was not referring to children who are loved and cared for intimately, but to
children whose parents constantly hover over them, solve every problem, and relieve the child of any duties
or responsibilities. As a result, the child never learns to take care of itself or to interact with others in a
cooperative manner.
The more deeply I have delved into the problem of neurosis and searched the cases presented, the
more clearly have I come to see that in every individual with a neurosis some degree of pampering can be
traced...Under such circumstances the child develops like a parasite. . . (pp. 88-89; Adler, 1932a/1964)
Extending this idea, Adler wrote that whether one is dealing with dicult children, nervous or insane
persons, suicides, delinquents, drug-addicts, or perverts, etc. there is a lack of social feeling (Adler, 1964).
In other words, they simply do not function well in relationship to others because they have never had to. As
for the neglected child, one who is unwanted, they have had no opportunity for social interaction whatsoever,
since their own family fails to interact with them. In cases of suicide, Adler believed that even death can
be desired as a means of revenge against those who have hurt or neglected a child by showing others what
they have lost in the one they failed to love (Adler, 1967). Since feelings of neglect are relative, pampered
children often nd themselves in situations, later in life, where they feel neglected, since they may no longer
receive the pampering to which they have become accustomed (Adler, 1932a/1964).

Discussion Question: How would you describe your style of life? Adler believed that dysfunctional
styles of life often result from either pampering or neglect. Do you know anyone whose style of life clearly
reects how they were raised? Are they someone you like to spend time with, or someone you would rather
avoid?

Social Interest and Cooperation
Adler believed that the right way to achieve superiority was through social interest and the cooperation that naturally follows. This is not some high-minded philosophy, however, but simple reality. According
to Adler, we are in the midst of the stream of evolution. As such, the human species as a whole has sought
superiority, just as each individual seeks their own personal superiority (Adler, 1964).

The individual's

weakness causes them to seek support from others, by living within a society:
All persons feel inadequate in certain situations. They feel overwhelmed by the diculties of life and are
incapable of meeting them single-handed. Hence one of the strongest tendencies in man has been to form
groups in order that he may live as a member of a society and not as an isolated individual. This social
life has without doubt been a great help to him in overcoming his feeling of inadequacy and inferiority. We

know that this is the case with animals, where the weaker species always live in groups. . .On the other hand,
gorillas, lions, and tigers can live isolated because nature has given them the means of self-protection. A
human being has not their great strength, their claws, nor their teeth, and so cannot live apart. Thus we
nd that the beginning of social life lies in the weakness of the individual. (pp. 60-61; Adler, 1929a)
This evolutionary perspective provides an explanation for the paradox that Individual Psychology is
focused largely on social relationships! Once again, we know (though perhaps unconsciously) that alone we
are weak and inferior, but together we can accomplish great things. Adler's hopeful vision for the future
is that someday humanity's social feeling will overcome everything that opposes it, and people will live in
harmony. In the meantime, however, he acknowledges that many things still oppose it, and work to destroy
the social feelings and social interest of children: sexism, racism, poverty, crime, the death penalty, suicide,
greed, mistreatment of the poor, the handicapped, and the elderly, and all forms prejudice, discrimination,
and intolerance (Adler, 1964). It is not an easy challenge facing humanity, but Adler suggested that the path
toward harmony lies, in part, in recognizing the three main ties that every person must take into account.
First, we are tied to this one world, the earth. We must learn how to survive here, given whatever advantages
and disadvantages that means. Second, we are not the only member of the human race. Through cooperation
and association we can nd strength for all, and we can ensure the future of humanity. Finally, we must
accept that there are two sexes.

For Adler, this last tie is resolved primarily through love and marriage.

While this may sound like a product of Adler's cultural upbringing, it also implies caring for and respecting
members of the other sex. Otherwise, love is a word used without meaning. Adler proposed that if we give
meaning to life through the recognition of these three ties to our environment, then others can share in our
meaning of life, and the benet will then return to us (Adler, 1931a).

Figure 4.1

Children often cooperate without any need for encouragement, especially when one of them has a skill
that another lacks.
In more practical terms, social interest is evident in cooperation. In order for an individual to overcome
their own feelings of inferiority they must know that they are valuable, which comes only from contributing
to the common welfare. Adler felt that those who seek personal power are pursuing a false goal, and they
will eventually disappear from life altogether. However, by contributing to family and society, either through
raising children or contributing to the success of one's culture or society, one can claim a sense of immortality.
Individual psychology is based on the premise that when a person realizes that the common good is essential
to the development of humanity, then they will pursue personal development that is in accord with the
greater good. They will recognize both the good and challenges that come their way as belonging to all,
and they will cooperate in seeking to solve the challenges. They will not ask for anything in return, since
they recognize that whatever they do to benet others is ultimately to their own benet as well (Adler,
1933/1964). This perspective is surprisingly close to Eastern philosophies and the concepts of interbeing and
karma, though Adler's religious references are primarily Christian (though born Jewish, Adler later became
a Christian).
In American society, work is often done by

teams.

The short denition of a team is two or more

individuals, with dierent roles, who socially interact in order to pursue some common goal.

Teams can

lead to successful outcomes in a wide variety of settings, such as in software development, Olympic hockey,
disease outbreak responses, or the unexpected damage to a spacecraft like Apollo 13 (for two excellent and

entertaining movies on teamwork, see Miracle [O'Connor & Guggenheim, 2004] and Apollo 13 [Howard,
Broyles, Jr., & Reinert, 1995]). However, teams can also lead to group failures, such as the international
intelligence failures leading up to the 9/11 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center, the Space Shuttle
Columbia accident, or the widely reported, storm-related deaths on Mt. Everest in 1997 (Kozlowski & Ilgen,
2006; Marks, 2006; for more on Mt.

Everest see Boukreev & DeWalt, 1997; Krakauer, 1997).

Given the

importance of teamwork, both in personal settings and within organizations, there has been a great deal
of research on teams, addressing cognitive, motivational, and behavioral factors, as well as information on
eective team design, team training, and team leadership. Despite the wealth of information on both the
positive and negative factors involved in teamwork, there is an interesting contradiction in the Western
world:

. . .We

school our children as individuals.

We hire, train, and reward employees as individuals.

And,

yet, we have great faith that individuals thrown together into a team with little thought devoted to team
composition, training and development, and leadership will be eective and successful. (pg. 115; Kozlowski
& Ilgen, 2006)

Discussion Question: Working in teams can turn out good or bad, depending on dynamics of the
team and the individuals involved. Are you actively involved in any teamwork? Does your team work well
together, or do the dynamics of the team cause problems and interfere with accomplishing your goals?

The Life Tasks - Work, Communal Life, and Love
Based on the three ties described above, our ties to earth, humanity, and the opposite sex, Adler described
three

life tasks: work, communal life, and love. Work relates to the earth in an evolutionary sense, dating

back to when our ancient ancestors were hunter/gatherers dependent on the environment for food and shelter.
According to Adler, all of the questions of life can be found within these three tasks, which challenge us
continuously throughout our lives. They tasks are not unrelated, since each one depends upon the successful
pursuit of the other two. Given this interrelationship, Adler believed that how a person approaches each of
these tasks, through their style of life, reveals a great deal about what they view as the meaning of life. It
is necessary, of course, for there to be balance. For example, a person in an unhappy marriage might spend
a great deal of time at work. This represents a mistaken style of life (Adler, 1931a, 1964). Worse still, is
someone who fails to pursue any of the life tasks:
Suppose, for example, we consider a man whose love-life is incomplete, who makes no eorts in his profession, who has few friends and who nds contact with his fellows painful. From the limits and restrictions of
his life we may conclude that he feels

being alive

as a dicult and dangerous thing, oering few opportunities

and many defeats. (pg. 7; Adler, 1931a)
The importance of the work task is to be found in the fact that we must do

something

with our time. As

people began to cooperate, they were able to divide their labors. Some would hunt, some would farm, some
became craftsmen, some raised the young, and eventually others served in the armies that protected all the
rest. In this manner, each person served a valuable role within society (even if the role was not prestigious),
and everyone beneted from the ability of each person to become more of an expert in their role. Of course,
this sort of social cooperation is the second task of life, the communal life or, as it is sometimes referred to,
having friends. Working with others for the common good can be quite dicult if people are doing so only for
their own benet, and it they distrust or fear those they seem to be cooperating with. As societies became
more advanced, and education became an important part of society, most societies encourage social interest
as an aspect of education. In America, for example, we talk about children learning to be good citizens, and
schools include many civics lessons. In addition, societies establish not only formal and informal guidelines
and norms for acceptable behavior, but actual laws are written to punish those who act in deance of the
common good. Not that this is easy! The rst amendment to the American constitution guarantees free
speech, which includes the right to challenge the very existence of our form of government. However, it is
generally recognized that the greater good is served by protecting the people from possible abuses of power
by the government. Without getting into a discussion of politics, this balance, which seeks to serve the best
interests of the community of citizens, has resulted in one of the longest lasting governments in the world
today.
When Adler referred to the third task of life, love, he was primarily talking about choosing a partner

to bear and raise children.

When a child is rst born, the love of its mother is the basis for the child's

development of social feelings. If a child is neglected, they do not learn how to relate to others, or if they
are spoiled, they do not need to relate to others. An early challenge for the child is found in the nature of
the father, and then any siblings who may be a part of the family. They typically do not approach the child
with the same tender love as the mother. If the mother protects the child from this, spoiling and coddling
the infant, a disordered style of life develops, but if the mother leaves the child to face this new challenge
on its own, they must rely on their creative powers to adapt to these dierent social relationships. Children
readily have this capacity, if they are allowed to utilize it. Later in life, each person must choose a mate in
order to have their own children, and their ability to adapt to relationships with love interests will, obviously,
depend on their own development earlier in life. Active, friendly members of a community will have more
opportunities to meet someone they are truly attracted to. Individuals who are successful and productive in
their work will be better able to provide for a family. And of course, the ultimate existence of each member
of the community depends on continued procreation of the species.

Thus, work, communal life, and love

come together within a healthy society for everyone's benet (Adler, 1931a, 1964; Lundin, 1989; Mosak &
Maniacci, 1999).

Connections Across Cultures: Randy Kearse and
Using Prison as an Opportunity for Change
One of the challenges to social cooperation is the ability to communicate. Communication takes place
in at least two important ways: language and shared experiences/goals. If we cannot understand what a
person is saying, then communication is obviously dicult. But even if we speak the same language, if our
entire perspective on life is dierent, particularly the direction in which we are headed (our style of life), it
can be even more dicult to really communicate. Randy Kearse is a man who has lived outside of what
many of us consider mainstream America. He grew up in a Brooklyn, NY ghetto, where he became well
versed in street talk, or what he refers to as hip-hop and urban

slanguage (Kearse, 2006a). Despite coming

from a relatively stable family (his mother was a teacher and all of his brothers and his sister graduated
from high school), he descended into a life of drugs and crime, eventually spending over 13 years in a federal
prison for dealing illegal drugs. This introduced Kearse to a large, and growing, subculture in America: the
prison population. Kearse learned one lesson very clearly in prison: he hated it! He hated people having
such power over him, he hated the disrespect his mother had to endure when she visited him, he hated the
food, he hated having the guards read his mail, etc.,

ad innitum.

With so many reasons to hate prison, there was no way I was gonna put myself back in the same situation
again. Brothers complain about being locked up everyday all day while they're there, but when they get
a chance to run the streets again their hatred for prison life fades away. That's crazy! (pg. 132; Kearse,
2006b)
But how does one stay out of prison?

In

Changin' Your Game Plan!

(Kearse, 2006b), Kearse oers

some very practical steps. But more importantly, he discusses why it matters, and how one needs to change
their mindset in order to be successful.

His advice ts well with Adler's emphasis on social interest and

cooperation, as well as with Adler's three life tasks. As Kearse says, what good is street pride when you
don't have the respect of your mother, your children, and other people who know what you're capable of
accomplishing?
Kearse believes that everyone has a purpose in life. Even prisoners serving life sentences can preach to
others about straightening out their lives so the ones who do get out of prison can stay out. For his own
part, Kearse is trying to set a good example now that he is out. He talks about the misguided sense of pride
that keeps people from working minimum wage jobs when they come home. Most people in prison do not
want their children to live such a life, but can they really set the right example when they themselves get
out of prison? One of the most important things to realize is that their style of life has helped to create the
problems that exist in their community:
We have a real obligation to make these changes while incarcerated because a lot of us are to blame
for the condition our neighborhoods are in today. We were major contributors to the chaos, mayhem and
destruction that have plagued our communities. . .The saddest thing you can see while incarcerated, is a
youngster young enough to be your son walk through the doors. (pg. 133; Kearse, 2006b)

In order to help their communities and their families, Kearse emphasizes that individuals returning home
from prison need to get a job and work for an honest living. Kearse tells New Yorkers exactly where to go
and how to go about getting ID and a social security card. He recommends getting a job as a messenger,
especially if you have a driver's license and can aord to buy a van (or if you save up the money to buy a van).
For most of us, having these things is simply taken for granted, but not so for many poor people growing up
in the city where such things may not be necessary (especially if one works illegally). One of the advantages
of having a messenger/delivery job is that one gets to travel around, meet dierent people, and become
aware of dierent opportunities. This proved very helpful to Kearse as he pursued his dream of publishing

Street Talk: Da Ocial Guide to Hip-Hop & Urban Slanguage
not complete.

(Kearse, 2006a).

Curiously, the book is

In acceptance of his publisher's concerns (representing the community), the commercially

available version left out the most derogatory slang pertaining to women, race, sexual preference, ethnicity,
and religion. Kearse later published a supplemental version (Da Grimy Version) through a private site. As
Kearse became more experienced, he established his own publishing company for his second book,

Your Game Plan!,

Changin'

and he is now working on an autobiography. Randy Kearse is working hard to make a

better life for himself, set an example for his community, and to honor the mother who raised him to have
ambition and dreams. His mother still loved Kearse when he was sent to prison, but her patience was limited:
Once I received my sentence my mother told me straight up, I'll ride this time out with you, but if you
get back out here and get caught up in them streets again don't call me, and I can't blame her for that.
How much can a mother take seeing her child going back and forth to prison? (pg. 33; Kearse, 2006b)
It would be very dicult for most of us to imagine what prison life and culture is like, or even what it
would be like to get caught up in the judicial system. But for people who live in dicult circumstances, it
can be just as dicult to avoid getting caught up in a style of life that promises instant gratication, but
which costs a lot of money. People who try to take shortcuts, such as stealing what they want, or selling
drugs to make a lot of money, end up with little to show for their life except a gang of years in prison.
Escaping this style of life requires a plan, and even more so the motivation for making that plan work:
Coming out of prison you have to have a plan. If you don't, the chance of you returning to prison is great
and you and I both know

these people

aren't playing. They'll lock your ass up for a hun'ned years and not

care. . .Shit is real. (pg. xxiii; Kearse, 2006b)

The Creative Power of the Individual and Fictional Finalism
The science of Individual Psychology developed out of the eort to understand that mysterious creative
power of life - that power which expresses itself in the desire to develop, to strive and to achieve - and even
to compensate for defeats in one direction by striving for success in another. (pg. 32; Adler, 1929a)
Adler believed that we are all born with a creative force: the

creative power of the individual. He did

not reject the concepts of heredity, temperament, or disposition, but he emphasized that it not so important
what we are born with, but rather what we do with it (Adler, 1932a/1964). As noted above, infants

are

inferior, so everyone begins life with feelings of inferiority. This leads to the striving for superiority, and the
development of a style of life, which is aimed toward some goal. The nature of that style of life is unique
because it is created by the child, and it is done very early in life. This is not a deterministic perspective,
this creation of the style of life is just that, creative, and therefore it must be unique (hence,

Individual

Psychology). Since Adler believed that all thought and behavior was oriented toward some goal, there must
be some goal that underlies the manner in which the style of life is created. Since a child cannot see into the
future and create a specic goal in life, Adler proposed that we are guided by a ctional goal, the so-called

ctional nalism (Adler, 1914/1963, 1928, 1929a, 1932a/1964; Lundin, 1989; Manaster & Corsini, 1982).
The ctional nal goal involves the sentiment of superiority, or at least the elevation of the personality
to an extent that makes life seem worth living (Adler, 1928). Thus, it does not need to be precisely dened,
which is important for our consideration that it is created by a young child. And yet it exists within the
child's mind, it provides the framework within which the style of life is creatively formed, and it serves as
the child's goal in life (though it remains primarily unconscious).

It is also important to recognize that

although this goal is ctional, it is entirely positive, it is a healthy and natural motivational force (Lundin,
1989). The ctional nalism should denitely not be mistaken for

ctive superiority. Fictive superiority

primarily, from having been pampered. A pampered child is superior, at least in the sense that everything
is done for them. However, adult life no longer sustains that delusion, yet the child has never learned how
to adapt to life's challenges, their style of life is set in the expectation of challenges being solved for them.
A healthy child, on the other hand, has learned to face challenges, and to strive toward overcoming them.
Thus, the healthy child develops a style of life that incorporates the process of facing and overcoming life's
obstacles, and this carries over into a healthy adulthood (Adler, 1932b/1964).
Within his discussion of the creative power of the individual and the ctional nalism, Adler began to
address what can be viewed as the foundation for cognitive psychology and cognitive therapy (see Chapter
12):
In a word, I am convinced that

a person's behaviour springs from his idea.

We should not be surprised

at this, because our senses do not receive actual facts, but merely a subjective image of them - a reection
of the external world. (pg. 19; Adler, 1964)
According to Adler, the prototype of the style of life, as it points toward the ctional nalism, is set in a
particular orientation. Throughout the individual's life, their perceptions of the world are then constrained
to fall into a groove established by the line of direction (Adler, 1929a). He referred to this phenomenon as
the

scheme of apperception. As a result of this scheme, the individual interprets experiences before they

are accepted, and the interpretation always agrees with the original meaning that the individual has given
to their life. When the individual has developed a mistaken meaning to life, or when experience cannot be
reconciled with the meaning they hold, they may be forced to change their scheme of apperception. This is
not easy, however, and only occurs when there is sucient social pressure to do so (Adler, 1931a).

Discussion Question: Adler described ctive superiority as the mistaken belief that one

is

superior to

others. What do you think about people who think they are great, who think they know everything about
everything, and can do anything at all, but who really are no dierent than anyone else?

Child Development and Education
Adler agreed with Freud that personality is basically set in the early childhood years. Thus, Adler was
particularly interested in child development, and also in the training of those responsible for raising children
(typically, the parents, the rest of the family, and school teachers). The emphasis in much of his work was
on ensuring that children are brought up in the best way possible from the very beginning of life. We have
already examined the importance of the mother's role, and that she needs to be supportive but must not spoil
her child. A child who is unable to resolve life's problem without the assistance of others will grow up into
a neurotic person demonstrating a dysfunctional style of life (Adler, 1913a/1963). Since this is something
that happens within the family, the parents obviously cannot serve as part of the solution for this problem.
Thus, Adler turned his attention to school teachers.
Adler believed that a person is educated when it becomes clear that they have become more relevant
to more people (Adler, 1958).

In other words, they become a more active and involved member of their

community, society, and perhaps even the whole world.

School represents a new situation for a child.

If

they have been raised well, they pass this test rather easily. If not, the defects in their style of life become
evident. School work requires cooperation with both the teacher and the other students, and the ability to
cooperate is probably more important than the child's innate intellectual abilities.

Adler did not dismiss

the importance of I.Q. (though he did suggest that the child and the parents should never be told what it
is), but he pointed out that a child's ability to concentrate on school subjects is primarily dependent on the
child's interest in the teacher (Adler, 1930b). So once again, we see the three life tasks coming into play.
School work is the child's work, and it must take place within a communal setting (the classroom).

But

what about love? Whether you want to call it support, encouragement, caring, motivation, or love, Adler
was clear in terms of what he thought about the peculiar position held by teachers:
The teacher, professional or amateur, must teach the simple thing: love, and call it by its simple name:
love. Almost since the beginnings of recorded history, however, the teacher has been in a peculiar position:
he is facing pupils, children or adults, who do not expect that the thing they ought to learn is so simple.
(pg. 115; Adler, 1958)
According to Adler, it is the role of teachers to recognize the diculties that children cannot overcome,
and to correct the mistakes of the parents. An essential aspect of this correction, however, is that it must

never be punitive. Adler believed that if teachers scold or criticize students who cannot connect with their
teacher or their classmates, then the child will realize they were

right

to dislike school.

Rather, teachers

must help children to connect with themselves, and then reach out to connect with others (Adler, 1931a).
But what about children who cannot redirect their style of life or face up to the challenges they encounter?

Discussion Question: Teachers play an important role in each person's development, according to
Adler. Who were the teachers who really inuenced you, and were they good teachers who helped you, or
bad teachers who inspired you to be a better person than you saw in them?
Adler wrote a great deal about guiding children, and about helping them to avoid and recover from
delinquency (Adler, 1918/1963, 1930a, 1931a, 1935/1964, 1963), and his daughter Alexandra joined him in
this endeavor (Alexandra Adler, 1930a,b). Often the discussion addresses the primary problem in Adler's
view: a lack of social interest due to having been pampered. In addition, both Adler and his daughter bring

birth order.
only child is in an unfavorable situation. Although they certainly receive attention and support from

into consideration an interesting family dynamic that appears to play some role: the child's
An

their parents, since they receive all of it they tend to be pampered and they lack practice in being sociable.
As they leave the pampered surroundings of the home, such as when they go to school, the child grows up
ghting against their environment and trying to dominate it. Their solutions can be passive, such as being
timid, anxious, or routinely getting sick, or their solutions can be active, such as being excessively talkative,
deant, or combative (Alexandra Adler, 1930a; Adler, 1929/1964). They face the potential of becoming like
parasites, people who do nothing but enjoy life while expecting others to take care of them (Adler, 1928).
The situation can be much worse, however, for the

oldest child. The oldest child was, for a time, an only

child, and received all of the privilege and pampering associated with that position. With the arrival of the
next child, however, they lose their privileged position, and the mother must be particularly attentive to the
new infant. The oldest child is

dethroned, and this can feel quite tragic, leading to consuming jealousy

and a bitter struggle to regain the parent's attention (Adler, 1929/1964, 1931a, 1963).

Dethroning is an

experience that always leaves a great impression, and can lead to a critical attitude toward the mother and
a turning away toward the father (Adler, 1929/1964). According to Adler, one often nds the experience
of being dethroned in the past of problem children, neurotics, criminals, drunkards, and perverts (Adler,
1931a).

Nonetheless, being the oldest child also has distinct advantages.

Amongst the siblings, the rst

born is typically the biggest and more experienced child. They have a certain power over the other children,
in that they are often given greater responsibility, including, perhaps, the responsibility of caring for their
younger brothers and sisters. They tend to be guardians of law and order, and they have an especially high
valuation of power (Adler, 1928). Adler was careful to point out, however, that too much is often made of
his theories on birth order. It is not the birth order, per se, which determines the nature of development.
For example, if the oldest child is not competitive, the second child may develop as if they were the rst
child. Similarly, if two children are born much later than their older siblings, the elder of those two may
develop the characteristics of a rst born.
In those cases where the challenges of adolescence become too much for a child, they begin to creatively
protect themselves by doing things such as forging report cards, skipping school, etc. As they meet others
doing the same things, they join with them, form gangs, and may well start out on a road that leads to a
life of crime. Demonstrating his great concern for the individual, however, Adler wrote:
All this can be avoided if we accept the point of view of Individual Psychology that no child should be
thought hopeless. We must feel that a method can always be found to help a child. Even in the worst of
circumstances there is always a particular way of approach - but this of course needs to be found. (pg. 179;
Adler, 1930b)
In a recent special issue of the

American Psychologist,

a series of articles were presented focusing on

eective, evidence-based prevention programs designed to increase the number of children and youth who
will succeed and contribute both in school and in life (Weissberg, Kumpfer, & Seligman, 2003). In accordance
with Adler's theories, eective parenting seems to be the best way to reduce adolescent problem behaviors,
and the family can be strengthened through approaches such as behavioral parent training, family skills
training, and family therapy (Kumpfer & Alvarado, 2003). School-based prevention programs can also be
benecial, but it is important that educational approaches coordinate social and emotional learning with

more traditional academic learning (Greenberg, et al., 2003).

Since the problems of adolescence are so

variable, including such things as alcohol, tobacco, and other drug abuse, violence, delinquency, mental
illness, etc., and since they aect so many children, approaches that attempt to intervene with one child at
a time may not be adequate. Accordingly, community interventions become important, and may go so far
as to require coordinated national eorts, such as Head Start or the combined eorts of the Department
of Health and Human Services, Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the Environmental
Protection Agency to reduce lead poisoning (Ripple & Zigler, 2003; Wandersman & Florin, 2003).

And

last but not least, health care providers can play an important role in ensuring the psychological well-being
of their patients, as well as their physical health (Johnson & Millstein, 2003).

Indeed, Adler quoted the

renowned Rudolf Virchow (one of the founders of cellular pathology; who coined the terms thrombosis,
embolism, and leukemia, among many other accomplishments) in saying: Physicians will eventually become
the educators of humanity (pg. 317; Adler, 1918/1963; see also Knopf & Wexberg, 1930). Perhaps the most
important aspect of these studies is the concerted eort to combine scientic research with clinical practice
and experience, as well as doing so in socioculturally relevant ways (Biglan, et al., 2003; Nation, et al., 2003).
Echoing Adler's call from 1930, and moving toward its answer:
If researchers can foster increased use of scientic practices in these ways, it is possible to achieve a society
in which the largest possible proportion of children experience healthy, happy, and successful development
and arrive at adulthood with the social, emotional, and cognitive skills they need to lead healthy and
successful lives. (pg. 438; Biglan et al., 2003)

The Psychology of Women
Adler's views on the psychology of women could not have been more dierent than those of Freud. As
someone who questioned cultural discrimination long before most, Adler considered women to be equal to
men, and he described the belief that they were inferior as a myth. A division of labor has always been an
important part of the communal life of the human species.

When neighboring groups came into conict,

it was the larger, stronger men who did most of the ghting to protect the group.

According to Adler,

men extended this conict and feeling of power to the subjugation of women. Ever since, men have enjoyed
privileges that were denied to women, and this has been maintained primarily through force, or the threat
of force, but also through indoctrination and education (Adler, 1910/ 1978, 1927/1978, 1928). Adler himself
avoided the use of the term opposite sex, a term that implies an adversarial relationship, preferring instead
to use the term other sex when referring to women (Manaster & Corsini, 1982).
Adler recognized that what women really desire is the privilege that men enjoy, but this is not unique
to women.
privilege.

There are also men, or boys, who are not dominant, and they also strive for superiority and
At birth, of course, both male and female infants are helpless and inferior, and must begin to

strive for superiority. The form that this striving takes is something Adler called the

masculine protest.

It was not his intention to suggest that masculine traits of dominance and aggression make men better than
women, but this was the nature of the times in which he lived. It is purely cultural that the male gender role
includes strength, knowledge, physical activity, etc., whereas the female gender role includes submissiveness,
weakness, the desire for physical and emotional closeness, etc.

All children display some degree of these

traits, but society directs boys toward the male role, and girls toward the female role (Adler, 1910/1978,
1912a/1963, 1928, 1929/1964). We can now recognize what many consider Freud's great mistake regarding
the psychology of women. Women who display masculine traits were seen as neurotic by Freud, but Adler
viewed them as protesting the cultural denigration of women. Still, it is not easy to challenge the nature of
society, so Adler still acknowledged that women were more likely to be neurotic than men. However, Adler
attributes the neurosis of most women to masculine protest,

not

to the inability to resolve a woman's penis

envy! In 1910, just as Adler was about to break away from Freud's Psychoanalytic Society, Adler proposed
that the great Oedipus complex is only a small part, just a stage, of the masculine protest, for both men
and women (Adler, 1910/1978).

Discussion Question: Adler described masculine protest as a cultural phenomenon in which women,
and even some men, strive to act masculine in order to ensure the privilege reserved only for men. Can you
think of any strong women whose career or style of life ts into this theory? What about any men you know
(or know of )?

Are strong women just that, or are they acting out their masculine protest?
Adlerian Psychotherapy
Adler's approach to psychotherapy has been the topic of numerous books and chapters (e.g., Dinkmeyer,
Dinkmeyer, Jr., & Sperry, 1979; Mosak, 1995; Nikelly, 1971a; Watts & Carlson, 1999), including specic books on family therapy and lifestyle counseling for people with disabilities (Rule, 1984; Sherman &
Dinkmeyer, 1987). It is generally accepted that Adlerian psychotherapists have no specic technique, but
rather are eclectic in their approach. There are, however, a few key elements to Individual Psychology. First
is the goal of understanding the style of life.

Once the therapist understands the style of life, they can

understand most everything the patient does. The therapist then helps the patient to strengthen their social
interest.

This involves a practical application of social interest: reorienting and readjusting the patient's

style of life. Underlying the success of therapy in Individual Psychology is a supportive therapeutic relationship. Adler believed in facing his clients, on an equal basis. The therapist helps to educate the patient on
the nature of therapy and the goals that might be pursued, which involves helping the client to recognize
the mistaken style of life and goals they have been pursuing in the past. In this way, the therapist helps
the client in their own creative process of personality change (Dinkmeyer, Dinkmeyer, Jr., & Sperry, 1979;
Mosak, 1995). This approach shares many similarities with both the client-centered approach popularized
by Carl Rogers and the behavioral-cognitive approaches developed by Albert Ellis and Aaron Beck.

Understanding the Style of Life
Psychotherapy is about helping people to change their lives for the better.

Thus, it involves looking

forward, despite whether or not we need to know what has happened in the past (and dierent theories
consider the importance of the past in radically dierent ways). According to Adler, in order to understand
a person's future we must understand his style of life (pg.

99; Adler, 1929a).

The style of life, and the

associated scheme of apperception, brings all experience into line with the person's ctional nal goal. So,
if we can understand how a person is living their life, if we understand their style of life, we can help
them to understand it as well, and then perhaps make changes for the better. So, how might we go about

understanding the style of life?
As Freud and Breuer had before him, one area of interest for Adler was the analysis of dreams. However,
Adler did not distinguish between the conscious and unconscious, or between waking and sleep. He considered
dreams to be a reection of the style of life, and the individual's striving for superiority. Thus, dreams do
not hold any special meaning (Adler, 1912b/1963, 1928, 1929a, 1932b/1964). As such, their interpretation
can be relatively straight-forward:
Take, for instance, our knowledge that mankind as a whole is really cowardly. From this general fact we
can presuppose that the largest number of dreams will be dreams of fear, danger, or anxiety. And so if we
know a person and see that his goal is to escape the solution of life's problems, we can guess that he often
dreams that he falls down. Such a dream is like a warning to him: Do not go on - you will be defeated.
(pg. 155; Adler, 1929a)
Of greater interest to Adler was the analysis of

early memories. He believed that the earliest childhood

recollections provided valuable information, and he did not let a single patient go without having been asked
about them:
The information regarding memory is signicant. Memory is an activity. It is based on the life style,
which here steps in by selecting from old impressions a single one. This leads us to the question, why this
single one? In it the entire life style resonates. (pg. 197; Adler, 1932b/1964)
It is not even important if the memory is, in fact, true. A memory may be created by a child based on
their conscious experience in order to reect an attitude, or an emotional tone, if that is necessary to pursue
their unique, personal goal (Adler, 1928). Accordingly, if we can obtain a person's earliest memories, we make
reasonable predictions regarding the future course of their life.

However, early memories are not reasons

for behavior, but they are hints. It is also true that some forgotten memories (or unconscious memories)
may have played a role in the creation of the style of life, but they are obviously more dicult to obtain,
so they defy analysis. But, Adler did not consider them to be any dierent in content and tone from the
conscious memories; the unconscious psyche enacts the same style of life toward the same nal goal (as with
dreams; Adler, 1929a, 1931a, 1964). There may, however, be some interesting dierences in early memories
based on culture. For example, Wang (2006b) examined the earliest memories of European American and
Taiwanese college students in response to ve cue words: self, mother, family, friend, and surroundings. In
both groups, memories for `mother' came from an earlier time than memories for `self,' and memories for
`mother,' `family,' and `friend' were more socially oriented. The European Americans typically had memories
from earlier ages, and their memories tended to report more specic events and to focus on their personal
roles and autonomy in those memories. Thus, early memories not only reect one's style of life, but do so
within a cultural context.
In two major case studies published by Adler,

The Case of Miss R.

(1929b) and

The Case of Mrs. A

(1931b), the subtitle of each book refers to the style of life. In the latter book, he concludes by saying: I
have simply wanted to show you the COHERENCE OF A LIFE-STYLE (pg. 46; Adler, 1931b). Moving
well beyond neurosis, both Adler and his son Kurt applied the study of the style of life to patients suering
from psychotic disorders, including schizophrenia and manic phase of bipolar disorder (Adler, 1929/1964;
Kurt Adler, 1959). Kurt Adler does an excellent job of summarizing Individual Psychology, and he quotes
his father's description of neurosis and psychosis as attempts by a person to avoid clashing with reality and
exposing their weakness and inferiority. However, these are failed styles of life, because they lead to an
avoidance of social interest, which is necessary for solving life's challenges in cooperation with others. In the
case of a disorder such as schizophrenia, the child begins life with extreme feelings of inferiority, which lead
to an exaggerated ctional goal. Subsequently, it is more dicult to achieve any success in life, which creates
a vicious cycle of failure and greater distrust of others.

Finally, as the individual fails to develop social-

emotional capacities, common sense, or logic, they retreat into the private world that accommodates their
exaggerated ctional personal goal. The subsequent treatment of psychotic patients is dicult, particularly
if the therapist expects too much. Kurt Adler extends his father's caution that the therapist must be aware
of their own style of life, set aside any personal expectations, and never

expect

anything of the patient

(Kurt Adler, 1959). As we will see below, Harry Stack Sullivan also paid special attention to psychodynamic
processes in schizophrenia.

Discussion Question: What are your earliest memories, especially of your mother, father, and sense
of self ? Can you see a clear relationship between the content of those memories and your style of life? How
does your life plan t with those memories?

Strengthening Social Interest and Reorienting the Style of Life
Adler believed that everyone has some degree of social interest, but in neurotic and psychotic patients
there is relatively less. He described Freudian transference as an expression of the patient's social interest,
directed toward the therapist. Resistance is simply the patient lacking the courage (i.e., feeling too inferior)
to return to social usefulness and cooperation with others. The therapist must, therefore, help the patient
to strengthen their social interest and reorient their style of life. Since the style of life is creatively formed,
it becomes important to understand how and when the failed style of life began. Just as the individual took
time and was selective in the formation of their failed style of life, the therapist must take time to understand
it and educate the patient about it (Adler, 1913b/1963, 1929/1964, 1930c, 1932b/1964, 1958).
Individual Psychology stresses enormously that the psychological development of a person can reach a
normal condition only when he can achieve the necessary degree of ability to cooperate. (pg. 199; Adler,
1932b/1964)
It is almost impossible to exaggerate the value of an increase in social feeling. . .The feeling of worth and
value is heightened, giving courage and an optimistic view. . .The individual feels at home in life and feels
his existence to be worthwhile just so far as he is useful to others. . . (pg. 79; Adler, 1929/1964)
There are numerous ways in which a therapist can help a client to increase their social interest.

It

begins with the therapist openly communicating with and accepting the patient, which is, of course, a social
interaction. This is especially eective if the therapist displays social feeling themselves, while also helping
the patient to recognize the patient's value as a human being (as well as the value of other people). The
therapist can point out that if other people, including the therapist, had the same values, goals, and cognitive
orientation as the patient then others would also have the same problems as the patient. The therapist can
then nudge the patient toward their own niche, where they can feel comfortable with others without fearing
being the loser in personal interactions. And nally, the therapist can encourage the patient to get involved
in concerns outside themselves (Nikelly, 1971b). Each of these ways of encouraging social interest can be
a part of the reorientation and readjustment process, the working-through phase of therapy, in which the
patient gains insight into their style of life, confronts their goals, and realizes that they are capable of making
choices and decisions (Nikelly & Bostrom, 1971). The patient must be encouraged to understand and believe
that they have the power to implement their insights and change their life.
The client must not be allowed to think of himself as the victim of past circumstances but must come to
recognize that the problem is his alone and that he alone will solve it. In contrast, emphasis on past history
may lead to rationalization and intellectualization without appropriate action. The client learns more and
more about his problem and does less and less about it. (pg. 103; Nikelly & Bostrom, 1971)

Group Psychotherapy and Family Therapy
Our discussion of Adlerian psychotherapy would not be complete without mentioning group psychotherapy, and in the same breath, family therapy. Group psychotherapy probably has multiple origins,
having been tried by a variety of independent therapists. In 1921, Adler began interviewing and counseling parents in front of a group of professionals. This t well within his perspective on the three life tasks
and social interest, since he felt that parents, family, and other important people, such as school teachers,
needed to be involved in the development of children. Adler soon discovered that these settings led to personal growth in everyone present, establishing a form of group therapy that may be the oldest still in use.
Strictly speaking, Individual Psychology does not prescribe any specic techniques for group psychotherapy,
but rather, there is Individual Psychology for patients in a private setting as well as for patients receiving
therapy in a group setting (Corsini, 1971).
Involving the parents in a child's therapy is, quite obviously, the beginning of family therapy. However,
when Adler established his child guidance centers, they were open for parents, teachers, social workers, and
other interested people to be able to observe the process of psychotherapy.

Adler felt it was important

for everyone involved in the development of children to be educated in the important process of Individual
Psychology, and the same was true of Rudolf Dreikurs, a student of Adler who opened family education

91

centers in the United States (the rst in Chicago in 1937; see Dreikurs, 1950; Sherman & Dinkmeyer,
1987). This education may be particularly important for the parents, whose attitude can have a profound
inuence on whether psychotherapy for a child is successful or not. As for teachers, understanding Individual
Psychology can help them to put a child's academic performance into a context that helps to explain it as a
style of life aimed toward a particular goal, even if that goal is dysfunctional and interferes with schoolwork
(Friedmann, 1930; Spiel & Birnbaum, 1930). Overall, the goal of family therapy is to improve communication
and cooperation amongst all members of the family, and to help parents avoid the most dicult problems
(Alexandra Adler, 1930a; Adler, 1930d).
In our conversations with the parents we relentlessly try to make them realize that children must not
be beaten. Beating can only lead to a discouragement of the child, and we know well enough that this can
make the child worse and not better. . .We always dissuade parents from engaging in warfare with the child,
since the child inevitably remains in the end the stronger party. (pp. 110-111; Alexandra Adler, 1930a)

Discussion Question: Have you ever experienced group psychotherapy, family therapy, or anything
similar (or know anyone who has)? What advantages did you experience, or what do you think you might
experience if you were to work on your relationships with family members or other people?

A Brief Biography of Harry Stack Sullivan
Several aspects of Harry Stack Sullivan's life history are quite strange, and so, according to some biographers, was Harry Stack Sullivan himself. He was born on February 21

st

, 1892, though his medical records say

he was born in 1886, in the rural community of Norwich, New York. His father's name was Timothy Sullivan
and his mother's name seems to have been Ella Stack, but it remains unclear whether her name was actually
Ella. That is the name that appears on Sullivan's birth certicate and on her death certicate, but in the
family records her name was listed as Ellen, and on Sullivan's baptismal certicate it was listed as Ellina.
Timothy Sullivan was a hired-hand on the Stack farm (or another farm nearby), whose father had died when
Timothy Sullivan was young, leaving the family quite poor. There was a great deal of discrimination against
Irish Catholics at the time, and Timothy and Ella struggled.

They lived in a poor part of town, where

there was an improperly drained canal that was believed to be a breeding ground for black diphtheria.
The Sullivans had two children before Harry, both born in February, who died in terrible convulsions before
reaching the fall of their rst year. When Harry was born in February, his mother was terried that he would
die as well (Alexander, 1990; Evans, 1996; Perry, 1982).
When Sullivan was 2

½

he was sent to Smyrna, New York to live with his maternal grandmother. Where

his mother was for the next few years is unknown.

It was rumored that she had a nervous breakdown,

and may have been kept hidden away in the attic of the barn until she recovered. Although she eventually
returned to public view, she was never really Sullivan's caretaker again.

Neither was his father.

When

Sullivan's maternal grandfather died, there was no one to run the farm, which provided the support for him
and his grandmother. Being poor himself, Timothy Sullivan was granted control of the farm. However, the
Stack family had always considered Timothy Sullivan to be beneath them (the Stack family had a prestigious
ancestry), so the legal documents were quite demeaning to Timothy Sullivan, and the farm's name remained
the Stack farm. Timothy Sullivan worked hard, but withdrew into himself and had little contact with others
(Alexander, 1990; Evans, 1996; Perry, 1982).
Sullivan did very well in school, but had few friends due to the common prejudice and discrimination. At
one point, the Ku Klux Klan burned a cross in front of the Stack farm. His only friend was a boy who was
5 years older, Clarence Bellinger. The two were very close throughout school, and both went on to become
psychiatrists. However, after high school, they never contacted one another again. Bellinger always spoke
poorly of Sullivan, and Sullivan simply never spoke of Bellinger. The reasons why are unknown, but it may
have something to do with the fact that neither one of them ever married, and Sullivan was widely regarded
as a homosexual.

When Sullivan was 35, he took in a foster son, who may also have been a psychotic

patient. Late in life, Sullivan seems to have referred to the young man as a lover (Alexander, 1990). If
this was their relationship when his companion was only 15, and if his companion was a former patient, it
was both unethical and criminal. It is tempting to suggest that Sullivan's sexual development and alleged
later actions may have been inuenced by an inappropriate relationship with Bellinger while Sullivan was
still quite young. However, the truth is not known, and there are other gaps in the history of Sullivan's life

(Alexander, 1990; Evans, 1996; Perry, 1982).
Two family members helped Sullivan with his education during his school years.

His mother's sister

Margaret, a schoolteacher, brought him many books and introduced him to a wide range of intellectual
ideas. His father's brother, Will, was a respected lawyer and then a judge who was inuential in applying
psychological issues to the law. He helped to foster Sullivan's interest in human problems. This aunt and
uncle both later helped Sullivan with college nances, and they helped him to win a prestigious New York
State Regents' Scholarship to Cornell University. However, Sullivan was not prepared for college. After a fair
start, his grades dropped drastically. He became involved with a group of boys who were illegally obtaining
and selling chemicals.

Only Sullivan was caught, and he was convicted of mail fraud.

His whereabouts

for the next 2 years are unknown. He may have been in jail, but there is evidence to suggest that he was
hospitalized at Bellevue Hospital following a psychotic break. Later in life he was friends with the renowned
A. A. Brill (the psychiatrist who rst translated many of Freud's books into English), and Brill was working
at Bellevue at the time. Sullivan was also friends later in life with another employee who worked at Bellevue
at that time, and no simple explanation can be given for his friendship with two men who worked at Bellevue
Hospital during the time Sullivan's whereabouts are unknown (Alexander, 1990; Evans, 1996; Perry, 1982).
In 1911, Sullivan reappeared and entered the Chicago College of Medicine and Surgery. He nished his
coursework in 1915, but did not receive a degree, possibly due to owing the school money. He worked briey
as an industrial surgeon in a steel mill, and in 1916 joined the Illinois National Guard. After only 5 months
he was released on medical grounds, supposedly due to a broken jaw. He then disappeared for a while, later
claiming that he received 75 hours of psychoanalysis during the disappearance. But where that occurred,
or with whom, is again unknown.

In 1917, he was nally awarded his medical degree, and he joined the

U. S. Army. His application contained many inaccuracies and falsications, including lying about his age.
Nonetheless, he was commissioned as a lieutenant, promoted to captain at the end of World War I, and
spent 2 years moving between Chicago and Washington, DC. In 1920, he left the Army, and again a year of
his life seems to be missing. In November, 1921, he joined St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Washington, DC, and
began his career in psychiatry (Alexander, 1990; Evans, 1996; Perry, 1982).
St. Elizabeth's Hospital was one of best psychiatric hospitals of the time (and remains so today), under
the leadership of the renowned William Alanson White, a pioneer in applying dynamic psychotherapy to
psychotic patients. After a year, however, there was no permanent position for Sullivan. So, he applied for a
position at the Sheppard and Enoch Pratt Hospital in Baltimore (as prestigious as St. Elizabeth's both then
and now). White's letter of recommendation for Sullivan was lukewarm and vague. He described Sullivan as
better equipped than the average State Hospital assistant, but he also acknowledged that he didn't really
know Sullivan because of Sullivan's personal distance from other people (Alexander, 1990).

Nonetheless,

Sullivan was hired for his rst clinical psychiatric position at Sheppard Pratt (as it is more commonly known
- Note: The author's wife had the privilege of working at Sheppard Pratt early in her career), and he began
an exciting and innovative period of eight years, during which he did the most important clinical work of his
career, including innovative techniques for the treatment of schizophrenia in young patients (Alexander, 1990;
Evans, 1996; Perry, 1982). Today, the Sheppard Pratt Health System includes the Harry Stack Sullivan Day
Hospital, a partial hospitalization program assisting adults with severe mental illness, including psychotic
disorders.
During his time at Sheppard Pratt, Sullivan became close friends with a young psychiatrist named Clara
Thompson.

They shared an interest in questioning Freud's concepts of the feminine psyche and other

challenges to orthodox psychoanalysis.

As Sullivan became particularly interested in the work of Sandor

Ferenczi (who accompanied Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung on Freud's only trip to America, but later split
with Freud), he encourage Thompson to go to Budapest and be psychoanalyzed by Ferenczi. She did so,
and upon her return she was Sullivan's training analyst, and Sullivan was later admitted to the American
Psychoanalytic Society. The two remained close throughout their lives, and supposedly agreed to marry one
another, but both quickly broke o the engagement the very next morning (Alexander, 1990; Evans, 1996;
Perry, 1982).
In 1930, Sullivan moved to New York City to establish a private practice and conduct research. However,
he failed to make much money, incurred some family debts following his father's death, and he led for

bankruptcy in 1932. The next few years were interesting, but unstable. He was the driving force behind
the establishment of the William Alanson White Foundation in 1933, and he actively collaborated with two
colleagues at Yale University (where they likely had an inuence on Erik Erikson's work).

However, one

of those colleagues died in 1939, and Sullivan immersed himself in a project studying Black adolescents in
Tennessee and Mississippi.

He then settled in Bethesda, Maryland, where he spent the rest of his career

(Alexander, 1990; Evans, 1996; Perry, 1982).
The year 1939 marked the beginning of a highly productive period for Sullivan.

Dexter Bullard, the

director of a psychiatric hospital named Chestnut Lodge, provided Sullivan with steady consulting opportunities.

This provided Sullivan nancial security, and through Chestnut Lodge he met many inuential

psychiatrists in the Washington, DC area. William Alanson White had died in 1937, and Sullivan delivered
a series of public lectures, which became the First William Alanson White Memorial Lectures, and which

Conceptions of Modern Psychiatry

were released as Sullivan's only book published while he was still alive:
(Sullivan, 1940). The White Foundation established the journal

Psychiatry. Sullivan also encouraged the White Foundation to establish a second training program in New
York City, and the core faculty included Clara Thompson and Erich Fromm. The second program is known
today as the William Alanson White Institute. When, in 1941, Karen Horney was disqualied as a training
analyst by the New York Psychoanalytic Society, Clara Thompson walked out of the meeting, and helped
to establish a rival Association for the Advancement of Psychoanalysis, with Horney as its dean. A series of
political battles between opposing psychoanalytic societies followed, in many ways pitting followers of Freud
against those whose interests and relationships were closer to Sullivan (Alexander, 1990; Evans, 1996; Perry,
1982).
In 1945, Sullivan became quite ill, and was urged to retire for his health.
a new challenge.

Instead, Sullivan accepted

He was invited by Brock Chisholm, who was soon to become the rst director of the

World Health Organization, to serve as a consultant for the post-World War II International Congress on
Mental Health. Sullivan focused on applying psychiatric principles to problems of world peace, including
educating children on values for peace.

He helped to establish the World Federation for Mental Health,

and participated in the UNESCO Seminar on Childhood Education Toward World-Mindedness. In January
1949, following a particularly frustrating meeting of the World Federation for Mental Health, Sullivan died
in a hotel room in Paris, France.

He was cremated, as he had requested, and his ashes were buried at

Arlington National Cemetery, honoring his service to the U. S. Army Medical Corps during World War I.
A committee was established by the White Foundation to publish his papers. Between 1953 and 1972, the
committee published seven books of Sullivan's work, ensuring that his theories remained available to the
elds of psychiatry and psychology (Alexander, 1990; Evans, 1996; Perry, 1982).

Placing Sullivan in Context: America's Psychodynamic Theorist
Harry Stack Sullivan was an enigmatic character. His parents were poor and, apparently, both suered
from mental illness; his siblings died during their infancies. The region where he was raised was extremely
prejudiced against Irish Catholics, and the KKK burned a cross in front of their home.

As a student,

Sullivan was very successful, but legal problems (due to his own bad choices) and presumed hospitalizations
for his own mental illness delayed his success in college and medical school. And yet, he went on to become
the most inuential psychodynamic theorist born in America, worked at two highly prestigious psychiatric
hospitals, co-founded an inuential foundation, and has a hospital named after him. Like Adler, however,
his contributions seldom receive proper recognition, and he remains somewhat obscure.
Sullivan's most interesting and enduring contributions relate to his relationship with William Alanson
White. Although Sullivan only worked with White briey, and White's letter of recommendation for Sullivan's next position admits that White considered Sullivan to be distant and hard to get to know, Sullivan
vigorously pursued White's interest in the treatment of schizophrenia. Sullivan helped to found the William
Alanson White Foundation, which established two psychiatric training institutes and the journal
and Sullivan delivered the First William Alanson White Memorial Lectures.

he is not very well known.

It has been suggested that he was the most original and creative American-

born psychiatrist (Chapman & Chapman, 1980). In Corsini & Wedding's

Current Psychotherapies

(1995),

Sullivan is mentioned in ten of the fourteen chapters, including those written by Albert Ellis, Carl Rogers,
Aaron Beck, and Rollo May, as well as the chapters written about Sigmund Freud, Alfred Adler, and Carl
Jung. Due largely to his emphasis on interpersonal relationships, he is acknowledged by Jean Baker Miller
and other founding members of the Stone Center (see Chapter 9; Jordan, et al., 1991; Miller, 1976). So how
can he be relatively unknown? According to Evans (1996), there are a number of reasons for Sullivan's lack
of popularity, but two seem to stand out. First, Sullivan did not publish much during his lifetime, and what
he did publish was somewhat poorly written and dicult to understand. Second, Sullivan was apparently a
very dicult and strange man, whose writings often included derogatory statements about psychiatry and
psychiatrists (even though this was his own eld). Whatever the reasons are for his lack of renown, Sullivan
has had a signicant inuence on psychiatry and psychology nonetheless.
Whereas Adler considered relationships to be an obvious consequence of social interest, the primary
factor in Individual Psychology is the striving for superiority. Social interest and interpersonal relationships,
of course, make healthy superiority possible. For Sullivan, however, it was the interpersonal relationships
themselves that were paramount:

One achieves mental health to the extent that one becomes aware of one's interpersonal relations . . .It
is part of the framework that supports all explanations of what is going on, what might be going on, and
what will presently be going on. . .It is

the

necessary formula to which everything must be assimilable, if it

is therapy. (pg. 207; Sullivan, 1940)

Euphoria, Tension, and Security
Sullivan believed that we exist somewhere between the states of absolute

euphoria and absolute tension.

Absolute euphoria is a state of utter well-being, which, unfortunately, is not really possible. The closest we
can come to experiencing absolute euphoria is in the deep sleep of a newborn infant. Tension is the alternative
state to euphoria, and tension is very much a part of our lives. It arises from two sources:

needs and anxiety.

There are two basic types of needs: those that arise from actual biological needs (food, water, air, etc.),
and those that are cultural or learned. In real life, however, these types of needs cannot be separated. An
infant cannot satisfy its biological needs, it must be cared for.

Thus, Sullivan talked routinely about a

mothering need, which is a need for an intimate, interpersonal relationship. When the mother does indeed
care for the infant, the infant experiences this as

tenderness, and the infant develops an ongoing need

for tenderness. Thus, through the need for a mother and the need for tenderness, the infant nds itself in
a world in which it needs interpersonal relationships for continued survival and psychological development
(Chapman & Chapman, 1980; Lundin, 1979; Mullahy & Melinek, 1983; Sullivan, 1940, 1953).
Anxiety is the result of real or imagined threats, and can be experienced by the infant or caused by an
anxious mother. In either case, it can be particularly intense in an infant because they cannot specically
do anything about it. Furthermore, unlike biological needs that can be met quite specically (e.g., a hungry
child can be fed), how can anxiety be satised? The answer, according to Sullivan, is through the pursuit
of interpersonal

security. In other words, a sense of security, the alternative to anxiety, can be obtained
empathy. Sullivan used the term

only through relationships that provide the child with tenderness and

empathy to describe the peculiar emotional linkage that subtends the relationship of the infant with other
signicant people - the mother or the nurse (pg. 17; Sullivan, 1940). Long before infants show any sense
of understanding emotional expressions, they seem to be able to share in emotional feelings, through what
Sullivan considered an innate capacity for empathy. Even an infant is not, however, merely a recipient of
the relationships in which it is involved, it is an active and engaged person. Likewise, children do not simply

organism that we were at birth, are unique, isolated individuals in the human world. . .

(pg. 219; Sullivan,

1964)

Dynamisms and the Self-System
Underlying Sullivan's emphasis on interpersonal relationships is the fundamental concept of

dynamism.

Similar to the physical universe, our psychological environment involves ongoing transfers of energy (in the
psychological sense) between ourselves and the people we interact with, and this is a dynamic back-andforth system (i.e., a relationship).

A dynamism is a relatively enduring pattern of energy transformation

that allows us to characterize a living organism. Each organism, or each person, has many dynamisms, but
the ones of particular interest to psychiatrists, according to Sullivan, are those related to how we interact
with others (Sullivan, 1953).
One of the most important dynamisms is the

self-system. The self-system is somewhat unique, in that it

integrates and provides meaning for all of the individual's interactions and experiences; Sullivan referred to it
as a secondary dynamism (secondary here refers to a higher level of processing, not secondary in importance;
Sullivan, 1953). The self-system also integrates the security operations, and serves to protect the individual
from tension. Chapman & Chapman (1980) oer a useful description of various ways in which the self-system
utilizes security operations in the actions of a 3-year-old child:
1. When faced with an emotionally threatening situation, the child may lapse into stubborn silence.
2. When there is tension between the child and the demands of older children, the child will obstinately
resist the eorts of the older children to get the child to conform to their desires.
3. When stressful interpersonal situations arise, the child will withdraw into solitary play.
4. In new, anxiety-provoking environments the child will physically cling to a familiar adult.
5.

When anxiety arises between the child and others, the child may engage in meticulous play with

inanimate objects (toys, coloring books, etc.).
6. When the child's emotional needs are not met by others, they may regress into more immature behavior
and speech.
By observing these behaviors, we can understand who this child is at this point in their life.
3-year-old, such behaviors are quite normal.

For a

However, such security operations would be considered less

appropriate for an adult. And yet, sometimes these behaviors become part of the self-system of an adolescent,
or an adult, and Sullivan referred to such instances as

dynamisms of diculty (Sullivan, 1956, 1972).

When dynamisms of diculty go into action, they fail to achieve a desired goal, or at best achieve only
an unsatisfactory goal. Since they are relatively enduring, as are all dynamisms, they tend to characterize
states of psychological illness, and would indicate the need for psychotherapy. As a curious side-note, while
discussing the dynamism of the self-system, Sullivan appears to be the rst person to have used the now
well-known term

signicant other (Sullivan, 1953).
personication. A newborn infant cannot really understand

Another important type of dynamism is the

who their mother is, or who they themselves are, so the infant develops an image of the mother, the father,
themselves, etc. These images, which can sometimes conict with one another, are called personications.
For instance, when the mother feeds and comforts the infant, she is the good mother. But when she fails to
display appropriate tenderness, or her own anxiety is expressed to and experienced by the infant, she is the
bad mother. Later, as the child develops greater intellectual capacity and experience, these personications
are fused into a single mother. Similarly, the infant begins life with personications of itself as sometimes
bad and sometimes good, and later in life fuses these personications as the adolescent begins to establish
a clear identity (Chapman & Chapman, 1980; Mullahy & Melinek, 1983; Sullivan, 1953, 1964). As with all
of the concepts we have discussed here, the process of personication continues into adulthood. A mother
will develop her own personications of the infant, which, as mentioned above, may be experienced by the
infant. For example, if a baby is colicky (cries constantly and cannot be soothed), it can be very frustrating
for a mother, especially a new mother. Her anxiety may lead to a personication of her baby as inconsolable
and of herself as a bad mother. Her discomfort, then, in caring for her baby can be experienced by the
baby, leading to the baby's personication of her as a bad mother. The key here, according to Sullivan's
theory, is that neither the mother nor the baby is in any way bad or good, inconsolable or tender,

Sullivan described the

personied self as those aspects of personality about which one is consciously

This provides important information for a psychotherapist, and pursuing information about the

personied self is an important part of the

psychiatric interview (Sullivan, 1954). During the interview,

Sullivan recommended that the psychotherapist examine four aspects of personied self: what does the patient esteem and/or disparage about themselves; to what experiences is the patient's self-esteem particularly
and unreasonably vulnerable; what are the characteristic security operations employed when the patient is
made anxious; and how great are the patient's reserves of security? In addition to these important points,
Sullivan also considered it essential for a psychotherapist to gain an impression of the whole interview situation, particularly with regard to the patient's sense of proportion in terms of where they t into life.
By understanding the personied self, the patient's knowledge of themselves, and how they view themselves
within the context of their life, the psychotherapist can gain an understanding of what is realistically possible
for the patient during the course of therapy (Sullivan, 1954).

Discussion Question: Sullivan described the personied self as knowing what you like or dislike about
yourself, what experiences are particularly damaging to your self-esteem, your characteristic security operations, and how deep your reserves of security are. Consider each of these points, and provide yourself with a
self-evaluation. Overall, do you see yourself as a relatively healthy, secure person, or someone whose life is
plagues by tension and anxiety?

Developmental Epochs
Sullivan considered an understanding of the course of human development to be essential to understanding

developmental epochs: infancy, childhood, the juvenile era, preadolescence, early adolescence, late adolescence, and adulthood (Sullivan, 1953, 1954, 1964). These

individuals. He described seven

developmental stages represent a gradual unfolding of the individual's capacity for eective interpersonal
relationships or, in other words, the individual's ability to t into the social structure of their environment
(Chrzanowski, 1977; Lundin, 1979).

As we all know, children maintain very dierent relationships than

adults do, and we would not expect children to have adult-like relationships.

Thus, when attempting to

evaluate a person's state of mental health, which Sullivan equated with their ability to form healthy relationships, we clearly need to understand something about what constitutes the developmentally appropriate
possibilities.
Infancy begins at birth, and lasts until the acquisition of speech. It is the time of the most empathic
connection between the infant and its caregivers, which can be characterized by tenderness and security,
or by anxiety and tension.

Childhood lasts through the remainder of the preschool years, and involves

extending one's interpersonal relationships outside of the immediate family to peers (friends and playmates).
In addition, language is incorporated into one's experiences of approval and disapproval. The juvenile era
begins as one enters grade school. Once again, interpersonal relations are expanded to include a wider variety
of people and situations, including competition with one's peers and subordination to authority gures (such
as teachers and the school's principal).
Adolescence involves some very dramatic changes, particularly in the direction of the intensely intimate
relationships of adulthood. During preadolescence, there is a marked increase in the closeness of friendships
(e.g., best friends forever!), which is characterized by an intimate dynamism. Early adolescence is marked
by an interest in the other sex, and an erotic dynamism is formed. Late adolescence, which Sullivan placed
between the middle high school years the early college years, were a time of developing full and mature
interrelationships, as well as understanding of the need for responsible citizenship within one's society. When
these dynamisms, including the self-system, become stabilized, and society has transformed the individual
into a completely social being, the person has attained adulthood (Chrzanowski, 1977; Lundin, 1979; Sullivan,
1953, 1954, 1964).
Sullivan provided ages for the transition of these developmental epochs, but he also acknowledged that
they are based on experience.

Later, the arrested development becomes apparent through eccentricities in one's interpersonal relations.
The individual does not simply continue to act like a normal child, there is an increased likelihood that
this warp in personality development will also lead to malevolent dynamisms and the consequent social
problems (such as delinquency and crime).

Discussion Question: Do you know anyone who demonstrates arrested development (someone who
seems immature, especially in relationships)? Are you able to maintain a friendship with that person, or is
the situation too stressful?

Final Notes on Harry Stack Sullivan
From his early days working with William Alanson White, Sullivan was particularly interested in the
treatment of schizophrenia. One of the books published by the White Foundation was entitled

as a Human Process

Schizophrenia

(Sullivan, 1962), in which his longtime friend Clara Thompson described him as having

a genuine liking and respect for his patients. Later the White Foundation published a series of seminars
Sullivan oered to the psychiatric residents at Sheppard Pratt, as well as members of the Chestnut Lodge
and the Washington School of Psychiatry, on the treatment of a young, male schizophrenic. The text includes
commentary by others some 25 years after the seminar (see Kvarnes & Parlo, 1976).
Like Alfred and Kurt Adler, Sullivan recognized the diculty of treating psychotic patients. The prognosis, in Sullivan's opinion, depends to a large extent upon the patient's history of successful interpersonal
relationships:

. . .let us consider the empirical fact that the schizophrenia which appears in the form of a sudden dramatic
onset is usually considered to have a more favorable prognosis than the schizophrenia with more gradual
onset. But in those cases of sudden onset in which satisfactory experience with signicant persons in the past
is totally lacking, the patient may be practically beyond redemption; he may manifest empirically trustworthy
capacity for recovery to the extent of making excellent institutional recovery; but the psychiatrist is daft who
expects that he can put the patient out into the world without prompt relapse. (pg. 197; Sullivan, 1956)
Returning to Sullivan's basic concept of personality, he oered the following denition:
Personality is the relatively enduring conguration of life-processes characterizing all of the person's total
activity pertaining to such other persons, real or fantastic, as become from time to relevant factors in his
total situations. (pg. 47; Sullivan, 1972)
While this denition is rather sweeping in its coverage, it remains focused on interpersonal relationships.
According to Thompson, Sullivan was very serious about his own relationships:
The quality of his friendship showed the same genuineness and tolerance so characteristic of his relation
to patients. He was slow in making friends. He tested them for a long time. . .Once a person had passed the
test he could count on Harry for absolute loyalty. No matter what your mistakes - and he might point them
out to you privately - before the world he was on your side. . .He had a characteristic phrase when parting
form a friend - God keep you. (pg. xxxiv; Clara Thompson in Sullivan, 1962)

Personality Theory in Real Life: Achieving Athletic Excellence
Despite Physical Challenges
Adler's studies on inferiority began with physical problems, what he called organ inferiority (Adler, 1917).
Most students of Adler look past that medical beginning, and focus instead on the psychological inferiorities
that children experience during their development. However, there are many people with organ inferiority, or
what we more commonly refer to as disabilities, handicaps, or challenges. There may be some debate as to
which term is preferred, but since the phrase politically correct is itself a contradiction in terms, I will use
the terms

disability and handicap as presented in Warren Rule's book

to Disability

Lifestyle Counseling for Adjustment

(Rule, 1984). In his summary of previous research, Rule adopts the denition of a disability as

a relatively severe chronic impairment of function that occurs as the result of a congenital defect, disease,
or an accident.

Accordingly, disability refers to actual physical, mental, or emotional impairments that

become a handicap

only if

they cause lowered self-assessment, reduced activity, or limited opportunities.

When disabilities become a handicap, they can aect the individual's entire style of life. Thus, Rule brought
together a group of therapists trained in Individual Psychology, and published the aforementioned book on
using lifestyle counseling for people with disabilities that have led to handicaps.
However, not everyone with a disability develops a handicap.

inspirational by the way in which they live their lives in spite of their disability, or rather, as if they
simply were not disabled. Erik Weihenmayer (2001; see also Stoltz & Weihenmayer, 2006) was born with
retinoscheses, a degenerative eye disease, which slowly destroyed his retinas, leaving him blind by the age of
13. In high school, Erik spent a month one summer at the Carroll Center for the Blind in Massachusetts.
The summer camp included a weekend of rock climbing in N. Conway, New Hampshire (where the author has
done a lot of rock-climbing). Weihenmayer's rock climbing experience altered his life. He continued climbing
rock, and then moved on to ice-climbing and mountaineering.

He didn't just followed more experienced

climbers up the clis, he also learned to lead-climb: placing one's own protection along the climb and then
clipping in the rope, what climbers call the sharp end of the rope. I had the pleasure of climbing with Erik
in Michigan's Upper Peninsula a few years ago, while his seeing-eye dog slept in a sort of ice cave formed by
the overhanging ice. It is truly extraordinary to watch him climb. He moves so smoothly, as he feels the ice
above with his ice axe, and then sets the ice axe so deliberately when he nds the right spot, that you would
not know he was climbing blind if you only watched for a little while. Eventually, Erik decided to pursue the
Seven Summits, climbing the highest peak on each continent: Mt. McKinley (N. America), Aconcagua (S.
America), Mt. Everest (Asia), Mt. Elbrus (Europe), Vinson Massif (Antarctica), Mt. Kosciusko (Australia),
Kilimanjaro (Africa). He accomplished his goal in 2002.
Erik Weihenmayer is by no means the only well-known, disabled climber. In an amazing video,

to be seen to be believed. One of the surprising aspects is how they joke with each other about what they
are doing. As Erik is carrying Wellman, Wellman says: I don't know man. A blind man giving a para a
piggyback ride? It's a pretty scary thing!

When Herr starts climbing on a day when it was snowing, he

says his hands are getting numb from the cold. So, Erik asks him how his feet feel! Humor was always an
important part of Adlerian psychotherapy (Scott, 1984), so perhaps it should not be surprising that a sense
of humor is an aspect of their personalities. One of the funniest stories that Erik tells is about the time he
accidentally drank out of his climbing partners piss bottle (a bottle used to urinate inside the tent during
storms). Erik became quite upset that the bottle wasn't marked somehow, but his partner defended himself
by saying he had clearly written on the bottle which one it was. It slowly dawned on Erik's partner that
the writing was of no help to Erik. As another example of Erik's humor, consider the challenge he tried to
avoid after having climbed the highest peaks in Africa and North and South America:
Emma Louise Weihenmayer was born on June 21, year 2000, at 3:57 A.M. There is so much to learn about
parenthood. Sometimes being a father is about as intense as climbing Denali, Kilimanjaro, and Aconcagua,
all in a day. Because I'm blind, I tried to convince Ellie that I couldn't change diapers, but for some reason,
she didn't buy it. (pg. 303; Weihenmayer, 2001)
In addition to his climbing, Erik Weihenmayer is a college graduate with a teaching certicate, and he
spent some time as a middle school teacher. He also tried the sport of wrestling, and was a wrestling coach.
Trevon Jenifer was also a wrestler.
Trevon Jenifer was born without legs.

Perhaps even more challenging, however, was the fact that he

was the fourth child of a poor, single mother living in a ghetto outside of Washington, DC. Obviously, Trey
(the name he goes by) began life facing dicult obstacles, but little by little, things got better. His mother,
Connie, made a conscious decision to take care of him the best she could. She soon met Eric Brown, who
became Trey's step-father, providing a stable home for their family. He met a wonderful special education
teacher named Bob Gray, who got Trey interested in sports, and who helped to make participating in sports
a realistic possibility. He eventually joined a wheelchair track and basketball team named Air Capital, and
he was very successful on the track, setting national records in the 100-, 200-, and 400-meter races. It was
prior to his junior year in high school, however, that his step-father, who had been a wrestler, recommended
that Trey try out for the wrestling team, the

regular

wrestling team.

What Trey wanted more than anything was to t in, to have a normal social life at school.

Being in

a wheelchair, that was not likely to happen. However, he felt that sports might help him accomplish that
goal, so he did try out for the wrestling team. He worked hard, learned as much as he could, and he made
the varsity team as the 103-pound competitor (actually, there was no one else that light on the team, but
he didn't know that).

His coach, Terry Green, did all he could to help Trey nd a wrestling style that

would take advantage of his relative arm strength (he made weight without legs, so his upper body was
relatively large) while overcoming the disadvantage of not being able to balance or leverage his body weight
by spreading out his legs. Now it was up to Trey. He was nervous in his rst match, didn't assert himself,
and was easily pinned. In his second match he became the aggressor and earned his rst victory. The rest
of his junior year continued to be a series of wins and losses, and he ended the season 17-18. Of course, it
had only been his rst season of wrestling.
In anticipation of his senior year in high school, Trey continued to train hard. Outside of the ring he also
received recognition, and became a part of the social network of the school. He received a

Medal of Courage

from the National Wrestling Hall of Fame, he attended his school's prom, and he was chosen as co-captain of
the wrestling team. Once again, humor played a role, as he compared his strength to a teammate from the
previous year. Trey had made signicant strides in how much he could bench-press, so his former teammate
asked him how much he could squat (a lift done entirely with the legs)! Both wrestlers enjoyed a good laugh
at that one.
Trey was doing quite well in league wrestling, and he also began to do well in tournaments. Eventually,
he won a tournament, ended his season at 26-6, and from there went on the state championship. He won
his rst match, but then had to face an undefeated wrestler. He lost, but in that loss there was a sense of
accomplishment due to how far he had come:
I lost 5-2. . .I was hurt less by the fact that I lost, and more by the closeness of it. This one hurt even
more because of how close I was to beating the best wrestler in the state. Sharbaugh went on to win the
state championship. In fact, he won his last two matches very convincingly, 6-0, and, 12-5. He told reporters
afterward that my match was his toughest of the tournament. (pp. 171-172; Trevon Jenifer in Jenifer &
Goldenbach, 2006).
The next morning he had to return to the championships to wrestle for a chance at third place in the
state.

He began with a vengeance, scoring victories of 9-1 and 9-2.
th

place, was not so easy, but he won 3-1, earning his 30

His next match, and a shot at third

victory of the season. He then won his nal match,

and earned third place in the state championship. However, an even more important challenge now loomed
ahead of him: college.
Coming from a poor, Black family, there was no tradition of children going to college. However, a group
of concerned philanthropists became interested in supporting his dreams. His old coach at Air Capital had
talked to Jim Glatch, who coached wheelchair basketball at Edinboro College in Pennsylvania, a school
with a large population (10 percent) of students with disabilities. Trevon Jenifer currently attends Edinboro
College and plays on the wheelchair basketball team. He does not know if he will ever wrestle again, but it is
interesting to note that Edinboro College has a famous wrestler as their athletic director: two-time Olympic
gold medalist Bruce Baumgartner!
Recently, Trey was kind enough to respond to an email I sent him, and he provided me with an update on
how things have gone during his rst year of college. He misses wrestling very much, but he has really enjoyed
his return to wheelchair basketball. It probably didn't hurt that the team is very good, and they came in
second-place in the NCAA championship for wheelchair basketball. Trey maintained good grades, his family
strongly supports him in pursuing his education, and he has made many new friends. But a few challenges
remain. It has been a little dicult for him to get used to the weather in northwestern Pennsylvania, and
he has been too busy to attend as many book signings as his publisher would like (but he says they have
been very understanding). As for becoming the inspiration his mother thought he was born to be:
I think that I have inspired some people, and I think that is great, but I don't think that it has reached
all the people that I would like it too. My family says that I have done a good job, but I [think that I could
do a lot better], and I will try until I feel that I have reached that. (Trevon Jenifer; personal communication,
2007)

CHAPTER 4. ALFRED ADLER AND HARRY STACK SULLIVAN

The range of sports in which disabled individuals compete is extraordinary today.

Beyond the Barriers

also includes disabled individuals sailing, scuba diving, surng, and hang gliding. A few years ago, I began
practicing Tae Kwon Do, and I soon discovered that I had degenerative joint disease in both hips. I considered quitting Tae Kwon Do, but I was strongly encouraged to continue by my instructors, as well as by
my orthopedic surgeon and physical therapist.

I have since learned that Dirk Robertson, a former social

worker turned actor and writer, has worked hard promoting martial arts training for people with disabilities
(Robertson, 1991; see also McNab, 2003). Each person simply needs to be encouraged to do their best. Adler
suggested that the best way to strive for superiority was through social interest. Whether it's a climbing
partner, a wrestling team, a wheelchair basketball team, a martial arts school, whatever, when people work
together to help each individual achieve their potential, it can prove to be a highly rewarding experience.
Whilst it is important to be sensitive to their particular situation, their disability should not be the
central focus all the time. Their

ability

to learn, listen and adapt should be built on and encouraged. Do not

be over-protective or an instant expert on people with disabilities. The experts are the people themselves,
so listen to what they have to say. (pp. 101-102; Robertson, 1991)

Review of Key Points

•

Adler faced death numerous times as a child, including his brother's actual death. These events had a
profound impact on the nature of his theories.

•

Adler helped Freud gain recognition for Freud's personality theory.

This lends credence to Adler's

claim that he was never a student or follower of Freud, but rather a colleague interested in similar
psychiatric/psychological questions.

•

The fundamental aspect of Individual Psychology is that we are born inferior and spend our lives
striving for superiority.

•

Striving for superiority takes the form of compensating for our weaknesses, which, unfortunately, can
sometimes lead to overcompensation.

•

When individuals can not compensate, they may develop an inferiority complex. Extreme feelings of
inferiority can lead to the paradoxical superiority complex.

•

Adler believed that all thought and behavior was tied to some goal.

Our overriding goal is the life

plan, and we pursue it by living a characteristic style of life.

•

Dysfunctional styles of life can result from pampering and neglect, both of which reduce our social
interest.

•

According to Adler, social interest is the best way to achieve superiority, and it can most easily be seen
in cooperation.

•

Formal examples of cooperation include teamwork, which can lead to either positive or negative outcomes, depending on the circumstances.

•
•

Adler described three life tasks: work, communal life, and love.
Important aspects of our ability to strive for superiority are the creative power of the individual and
the goal we set as the ctional nalism.

•

Each person exists within their own perception of the world, known as the scheme of apperception.
This scheme guides all experience to t into our style of life and our goals.

•

Since child development is so important, Adler created child guidance centers to train both parents
and schoolteachers in the principles of Individual Psychology.

•

Adler was very interested in the eects of birth order and the family constellation. Being an only child
is likely to result in pampering, whereas an oldest child must deal with being dethroned.

•

In an attempt to understand the psychological motivation of women, and some men as well, Adler
proposed the theory of masculine protest.

•
•
•

The key to Adlerian psychotherapy is understanding the patient's style of life.
An important technique for revealing the style of life is the early memories test.
Once the style of life is understood, Adlerian psychotherapists work to strengthen social interest and
reorient the style of life.

•
•

Adler was an early innovator in terms of both family therapy and group psychotherapy.

Pratt.

•

According to Sullivan, we are a constant state of tension, due to our needs and anxieties.

We seek

security, and we employ security operations to reduce our anxiety and tension.

•

Sullivan referred to the energy transformation that underlies our personal interactions as dynamisms.
Perhaps the most important dynamism is the self-system.

•

When an individual develops dysfunctional security operations, Sullivan referred to them as dynamisms
of diculty.

•

Before we can truly understand relationships, we develop images in our mind known as personications.
The personied self includes everything we can consciously describe about ourselves.

•

Sullivan described seven developmental epochs, which provide a framework for our unfolding abilities
to engage in healthy interpersonal relationships.

Chapter 5
Neo-Freudian Perspectives on
1

Personality

Who were the neo-Freudians, and what exactly does this term mean? Many early psychoanalysts remained
basically true to Freud and his theories. These individuals are collectively known as either neo-Freudians or
as ego psychologists, for their emphasis on the ego. Shifting from Freud's emphasis on the id to an emphasis
on the ego is a major change, but it does not require rejecting the basic elements of Freud's theory. The
shift also encourages the study of children.

After all, it is during childhood that most of this dramatic

psychological development occurs. The neo-Freudians stand in contrast to Alfred Adler and Carl Jung, who
intentionally distanced themselves from Freud, and Karen Horney, who initially brought a female perspective
to psychodynamic theory (a perspective in which she directly challenged some of Freud's ideas on women)
but later shifted to a cultural perspective on the psychology of women. For an interesting introduction to a

active psychoanalyst in Berlin when the rest of Germany was largely mocking Freud's theory.
Ferenczi accompanied Freud and Jung on their landmark trip to America.

Sándor

A. A. Brill was inuential in

the development of psychoanalysis in America, and an early translator of Freud's works into English. As
important as these theorists were in their own right, they have not had quite the inuence of those whom
we will cover in this chapter.
First, we will examine Anna Freud's contributions on the defense mechanisms. Although her father had
described many of the defense mechanisms, he left it to his daughter to literally write the book on them
(A. Freud, 1936/1966). Anna Freud also moved beyond her father's work in at least one signicant way:
she contributed to the study of applying psychoanalysis to children.

Two other early contributors to the

application of psychoanalysis to children were Melanie Klein and D. W. Winnicott.

Although Klein and

Anna Freud shared an interest in studying children, they often did not agree. This conict led to a split
in the English school of psychoanalysis (Mitchell & Black, 1995). Winnicott had been trained in part by
colleagues of Klein, and he was supervised by Klein personally for a time, but eventually his independence
led him to develop his own theories. Having been a pediatrician before he became a psychoanalyst, he was
able to draw on a wealth of experience observing children interacting with their mothers (Mitchell & Black,
1995). Finally, we will take a very brief look at the work of Heinz Kohut and Margaret Mahler, and their
perspectives on how an individual nally becomes just that.

Placing the Neo-Freudians in Context - 1: Connecting Personality Theories
In one sense, it is not possible to put the neo-Freudians in context, because to do so would be to suggest
that these theorists have concluded their work. As we will see, the process of modifying Sigmund Freud's

theories toward some nal, comprehensive theory accepted by all psychoanalysts continues today.

So we

must keep in mind that we are really just putting those theorists mentioned in this chapter in context, and
this task is one that will continue into the future.
If you had been able to predict in 1910 what future perspectives on Freud's theory would become, you
might have easily done it.

Some theorists stayed true to Freud's basic principles, others took radically

dierent approaches, and the rest fell somewhere in between. Not surprisingly, the strongest supporter of
Freud's theory was his own daughter Anna. Although she shifted the focus of psychoanalysis from the id
to the ego, and emphasized analyzing children, these were reasonable extensions of Freud's own work. And
more importantly, she made these changes only within the constraints that her father's theory allowed.
In contrast, Melanie Klein made radical changes to psychoanalytic theory, and directly challenged the
views of Anna Freud. This challenge led to a public battle, one in which Anna Freud seems to have been
respectful toward Klein, but Klein did not return the courtesy. Subsequently a third group arose, a group
of moderates who appreciated the direction Klein had taken, but who had their own dierences of opinion
with her. Following a series of open discussions during World War II, it was agreed by all to acknowledge
the dierences among those who followed Anna Freud, Klein, or their own independent paths.
Eventually, subsequent theorists began to recognize the value in each dierent approach to psychoanalysis. Today, theorists like Otto Kernberg have come a long way toward blending the dierent neo-Freudian
approaches together. But there remained an important area of psychology that needed further study in its
own right: the psychology of women. The object relations theorists had laid an interesting foundation for
what became a relational-cultural approach to the study of women, and ultimately all people.

Anna Freud and Ego Psychology
Anna Freud (1895-1982) was the youngest of Sigmund and Martha Freud's six children, and the only one
to pursue a career in psychoanalysis. However, this did not come about immediately, and Anna Freud never
attended medical school as her father had.

Therefore, she was one of the rst lay psychoanalysts, which

is an important consideration for all mental health practitioners today (since Freud and most other early
psychoanalysts were actually psychiatrists who had attended medical school). In 1971, a survey conducted
among psychiatrists and psychoanalysts identied Anna Freud as the most outstanding colleague among
both groups (see Peters, 1985).
Anna Freud lived with her parents until Sigmund Freud's death in 1939. She was a lively child, with a
reputation for being mischievous. Although she always enjoyed a good relationship with her father, it was
her older sister Sophie who was her father's favorite daughter (Peters, 1985). She was quite intelligent, but
never attended college. She did, however, attend private schools, eventually entering the Cottage Lyceum in
Vienna during fth grade. She soon entered the Cottage Lyceum's high school, graduating in 1912. Since
she had not chosen a career, she traveled to England to improve her English, one of several languages she
had learned. Upon returning to Vienna, she became a teacher at the Cottage Lyceum's elementary school.
She was very popular among her students, one of whom described her as such a marvelous and simple gure
that I loved her deeply at that time (cited in Peters, 1985). Her popularity likely resulted from her own
love of teaching and for her students (Coles, 1992). Anna Freud considered this experience as a teacher to
have been very valuable for her later career as a child psychoanalyst:
The people who follow this line of thought hold that those who analyze children should possess not only
the correct analytical training and mental attitude but something further: something which is called for by
the idiosyncrasies of childhood, namely, the training and the mental attitude of the pedagogue. . . (pg. 130;
A. Freud, 1973).
Even before she graduated, Anna Freud had begun reading her father's works.
1918 that she entered into psychoanalysis.

But it was not until

Such a situation, a father psychoanalyzing his own daughter,

would be considered inappropriate today, but at that time the entire eld was still quite new and many
aspects of it were still experimental.

In any case, Anna Freud subsequently became one of her father's

most unwavering supporters and an important psychoanalyst in her own right. In 1920 she attended the
International Psychoanalytical Congress with her father, and 2 years later she was a member of the Vienna
Psychoanalytical Society and began presenting her own papers. In 1923 she began her own practice treating
children.

As Anna Freud was developing her theories regarding the psychoanalysis of children, Melanie Klein
was developing her theories in England.

There were signicant disagreements between them, including a

symposium in 1927 organized specically to provide an opportunity for Klein to publicly attack Anna Freud's
theories (Peters, 1985). After Anna Freud arrived to stay in England with her family in 1938, the conict
between them threatened to split the British Psychoanalytic Society. However, during World War II, a series
of discussion forums resulted in the establishment of parallel training courses for the two groups.
After the war began, Anna Freud helped to set up the Hampstead War Nursery to provide foster care
for over 80 children, a number that rose to a total of 190 children over several years (Peters, 1985).

In

addition to simply providing care for the children, she hoped to provide the children with continuity in their
relationships with sta and family.

With long-time friend Dorothy Burlingham she studied the eects of

stress on young children in wartime. This work continued after the war when she had an opportunity to help
provide care for six orphans who had survived the Theresienstadt concentration camp (Coles, 1992; Peters,
1985).
Throughout the rest of her life, she remained devoted to her work at the Hampstead War Nursery. She
helped to establish the Hampstead Child Therapy Course (in 1947) and a children's clinic. Eventually the
nursery became known more simply as the Hampstead Clinic, and Anna Freud became one of the major
gures in psychoanalysis.

She often traveled to lecture in the United States, and in the 1970s she was a

co-author, with two professors from Yale University, of two books about governmental involvement in the
lives of children who have been emotionally deprived and socially disadvantaged (see below). She received
many honors, including honorary doctorates from Clark University (where her father had lectured during
his trip to America), Harvard University, and Vienna University. The honorary medical degree she received
from Vienna University was awarded in 1972, only 1 year after she returned to visit her native city for the
rst time since the Freud's had escaped the Nazis in 1938.
Shortly after her death, the Hampstead Clinic was renamed the Anna Freud Centre, in her honor, and in
1986 her former home became the Freud Museum. Although she has been considered by some to have done
little more than continue her father's work, she was a pioneer in both ego psychology and the psychoanalysis
of children. Accordingly, she deserves to be considered one of the most inuential neo-Freudians. Much of
the information in this biography can be found on

The Anna Freud Centre

website, as well as much more

information on the center itself (http://www.annafreudcentre.org).

Ego Psychology and the Defense Mechanisms
In 1936, Anna Freud published perhaps her most inuential book:

Defense

The Ego and the Mechanisms of

(A. Freud, 1936/1966). She began by stating a redenition of the eld of psychoanalysis. There

was a general bias, in her opinion, among many psychoanalysts to focus on the deep instinctual impulses of
the id at the expense of considering the ego. However, since the id is always unconscious, its processes can
never be observed directly. It may also be dicult to observe the processes of the ego as well, but at least
the ego exists partially within the conscious mind. Since it is the ego that observes both the impulses of the
id and the restraints of the superego, and since the ego is available to the psychoanalyst, she concluded this
means that the proper eld for our observation is always the ego. (A. Freud, 1936/1966)
Although the ego is observable, that doesn't mean that a person's thoughts and behaviors always make
sense. As the id demands the satisfaction of its impulses, the ego attempts to restrain the id, in accordance
with the external demands of society and the internal representation of those demands in the superego.
When these factors come in conict, and the ego cannot easily resolve the conict, anxiety develops.

In

order to help alleviate that anxiety, and to continue restraining the impulses of the id, the ego resorts to
defense mechanisms. In so doing, the ego transforms the conict somewhat and attempts to keep both the
conict and the basis for the conict unconscious. When an individual is suering psychologically and has
sought help from a therapist, according to Anna Freud, the psychoanalyst arrives on the scene as someone
who disturbs this fragile peace. This is because it is the task of the analyst to bring into consciousness that
which is unconscious. . . (A. Freud, 1936/1966).
In order to understand how the ego uses defense mechanisms, it is necessary to understand the defense
mechanisms themselves and how they function. Some defense mechanisms are seen as protecting us from
within, from the instinctual impulses of the id (e.g., repression); other defense mechanisms protect us from

CHAPTER 5. NEO-FREUDIAN PERSPECTIVES ON PERSONALITY

106

external threats (e.g., denial). When treating a patient, the goal of the psychoanalyst is to determine how
much a given defense mechanism contributes to the symptoms and to the ego resistance of the patient (in
other words, resistance to therapy). To help understand these issues, Anna Freud identied and discussed ten

regression, repression,
reaction-formation, isolation, undoing, projection, introjection, turning against the self, reversal, and sublimation. See Table 6.1 for a description of some of the defense mechanisms most commonly
defense mechanisms as being commonly recognized in the eld of psychoanalysis:

discussed today.
The defense mechanisms are not all available to an individual at the same time. As originally proposed
by her father, Anna Freud believed that the defense mechanisms develop with the structures of personality
(the id, ego, and superego). For example, projection and introjection depend on the dierentiation of the
ego from the outside world, so they would not be available to the ego as defense mechanisms until the ego
had suciently developed (and, perhaps, dierentiated into the superego as well; A. Freud, 1936/1966).
This became an important point of contention, however, with the English school of analysis that included
Melanie Klein. Whereas Anna Freud and her colleagues believed that projection and introjection would not
be available in early childhood, since the structures of personality have not adequately developed, members
of the English school believed that projection and introjection were a necessary part of that development.
Although this debate and others between Freudian and Kleinian theorists became rather bitter (Mitchell &
Black, 1995), Anna Freud did acknowledge the following:
These dierences of opinion bring home to us the fact that the chronology of psychic processes is still
one of the most obscure elds of analytic theory. . .So a classication of the defense mechanisms according to
position in time inevitably partakes of all the doubt and uncertainty which even today attach to chronological
pronouncements in analysis. It will probably be best to abandon the attempt so to classify them and, instead,
to study in detail the situations which call for the defensive reactions. (pg. 53; A. Freud, 1936/1966)
The nal outcome of personality development, whether primarily normal or abnormal, depends on the
overall process of these defense mechanisms throughout development. It is natural that defense mechanisms
are called upon by the ego during both waves of psychosexual development. Whether or not the ego develops as a yielding and exible structure depends on the strength of the instincts during development and the
environment in which the individual develops. If instinctual demands are excessively urgent during development, the ego will redouble its defensive activities. This can stien the resistance of the ego to the instinctual
impulses, leading to symptoms and inhibitions that remain throughout life (A. Freud, 1936/1966). At least,
they might remain until the patient is successfully analyzed by a qualied psychoanalyst.
What is the status of defense mechanisms in psychology today?

Clinical psychologists have always

found the concept of defense mechanisms useful, but for a period of time defense mechanisms did not
receive much attention from academic psychologists (Cramer, 2000). The primary reason for this was that
early studies aimed at demonstrating the existence of the defense mechanisms and their processes were
not promising.

However, these are particularly dicult processes to study, since much of the processing

occurs unconsciously (Cramer, 2000; Kernberg, 2004).

According to Cramer (2000), as the various elds

of psychology developed, they began to examine psychological processes that received new names within
the particular eld, even though the processes being studied were actually defense mechanisms that had
already been discovered within psychoanalysis. Just to cite a few examples: what cognitive psychologists
describe as selective attention may involve the defenses of splitting and dissociation, in social psychology
scapegoating is a form of displacement, and in developmental psychology a child's verbal report of positive
emotion while their facial expression clearly represents negative emotion is a classic case of denial (for a
variety of examples and references see Cramer, 2000). Therefore, one can conclude that defense mechanisms,
and defensive processes, have remained an important aspect of psychology and psychotherapy since they
were rst described by Sigmund Freud and Josef Breuer in 1895 (Freud & Breuer, 1895/2004).

Discussion Question: Anna Freud believed that even normal personality development involved the
common use of defense mechanisms.

Consider your own personality.

Are there situations that make you

anxious and, if so, can you recognize the defense mechanisms you rely on? Do you have a common defense
mechanism that you use more than any other?

As mentioned above, Anna Freud began her career as a school teacher. This interest in children never
diminished, and as she began to devote her career to psychoanalysis and psychoanalytic research her focus
remained on the psychological lives of children. In 1946 she published

Children

The Psycho-Analytical Treatment of

(A. Freud, 1946). This book is a collection of works she had written mostly in 1926 and 1927, with

the nal portion having been written in 1945. The book begins with an interesting preface, an apology that
the book had not been available in English at an earlier date, particularly in the country of England. The
reason for this, according to Anna Freud (and many historians agree), is that in England the theories of
Melanie Klein dominated the psychoanalytic community (see also Mitchell & Black, 1995). Klein and her
colleagues believed that psychoanalysis could be conducted successfully with young children, and that the
process of transference occurred in the same manner as it did with adult patients.

Initially, Anna Freud

believed that psychoanalysis could not be performed with young children. Later, she acknowledged that the
eorts of her colleagues had helped to make that a possibility, but she steadfastly denied that she had ever
seen the normal process of transference in anyone younger than adulthood (A. Freud, 1946).

Repression
Repression involves blocking an impulse from conscious expression. Examples include forgetting a traumatic event, such as sexual abuse, or being unaware of hostile feelings toward family members.

Regression
When faced with dicult situations that we cannot resolve, we may regress to behavior indicative of an
earlier stage of development. For example, when we are very sick, we may act as helpless as if we were an
infant and hope that someone will take care of us.

Denial
Denial refers to simply refusing to believe an unpleasant reality. For example, when someone is told they
have a terminal illness, they may deny it and refuse to follow treatment recommendations.

Projection
Projection involves attributing our own negative impulses to another person. If, for example, we want
to see another person fail, perhaps to make us feel superior, we may claim that they are trying to interfere
with our success.

Reaction-Formation

A reaction-formation is the process of suppressing unacceptable impulses and

adopting an opposite course of action. For example, a parent who resents having children may shower them
with love.

Identication
We often model our behavior after people we admire, or adjust our behavior based on people we fear.
Internalizing this process of identifying with others is primarily how the superego develops, how we adopt
the rules and guidelines of our culture and make them our own.

Displacement

Sometimes we cannot respond directly to unpleasant situations, so we displace (or

transfer) our impulses onto another object. For example, if your boss yells at you at work, you then go home
and yell at people in your family.

Rationalization
Rationalization is the process of nding logical reasons for unacceptable behavior or thoughts.

The importance of the analysis of children in terms of research is threefold, according to Anna Freud.
It helps to conrm the theories develop by Sigmund Freud and others based on the analysis of adults, it
leads to fresh conclusions and new conceptions (and she commends Melanie Klein on this point), and it
serves as a point of transition to a eld of applied analysis that she felt might become the most important
of all: working with children as they develop (A. Freud, 1927/1973). What Anna Freud tried most to do
in her writings was to point out the circumstances that make psychoanalysis with children dierent than
psychoanalysis with adults. Fundamentally, there is no dierence in the process. However, the results of the
process must be viewed dierently in order to understand what happens with children. Since Melanie Klein
was actively pursuing the same goals, Anna Freud often wrote specically about Klein, acknowledging her
accomplishments, but also pointing out their dierences.
The basic argument was aimed at the intellectual and psychological abilities of young children, and the
extent to which the psychical apparatus (the id, ego, and superego) have developed. Since all three personality
structures have developed in an adult, there is no need for the analyst to worry about that. All the analyst
needs to do is to bring into consciousness the neurotic processes that have led to the patient's symptoms
(granted, that may be easier said than done). In children, however, the ego and especially the superego are
still developing. Therefore, the analyst must consider the role he/she may play in the development of the
child. The analyst must consider the extent to which the superego has already developed, and the analyst
may be able to take advantage of its continuing development and help to direct and/or instruct superego
development. According to Anna Freud (1927/1973):

. . .In

the analysis of the adult we are at a point where the superego has already established its indepen-

dence - an independence which is unshakable by any inuence from the outside world...But child analysis
must include all those cases in which the superego has as yet not reached any true independence. Only too
clearly it strives to please its taskmasters, the child's parents and others responsible for his training. . .we
have to use our inuence from without in an educational manner by changing the child's relation to those
who are bringing him up. . . (pgs. 138-139)
As these processes are actually observed, Anna Freud believed that the child's symptoms could transform
in the presence of the psychoanalyst, in a way that simply did not happen with adults. Thus, it was essential
to observe children from a dierent point of view than one observes adults. She acknowledged that Melanie
Klein had contributed to our understanding of how children might be observed, but she felt that Klein had
attributed too much to what Klein and her colleagues observed. Klein allowed children the opportunity to

play with toys in her oce, a situation in which the child's imagination can run wild. Klein believed this was
the same for a child as free association was for an adult. However, Anna Freud countered that an adult is
aware of their goals in psychoanalysis, whereas a child at play is not aware of being in therapy. As a result,
Anna Freud viewed the play of children as fundamentally dierent than an adult's free association:
The play technique worked out by Mrs.

Melanie Klein is certainly valuable for observing the child.

Instead of taking the time and trouble to pursue it into its domestic environment we establish at one stroke
the whole of its known world in the analyst's room, and let it move about in it under the analyst's eye but
at rst without his interference. . .
Mrs. Klein however. . .assumes the same status for these play-actions of the child as for the free associations of the adult patient. . .if the child's play is not dominated by the same purposive attitude as the
adult's free association, there is no justication for treating it as having the same signicance. (pgs. 28-29;
A. Freud, 1946)
Anna Freud's steadfast belief that children do not have the intellectual or psychological capacity for free
association, in part because they simply can't relax and lie still for an hour on the psychoanalyst's couch, also
raises questions for the use of the second most common psychoanalytic technique, dream analysis. Dream
analysis depends on the patient's ability to freely associate about the manifest content of the dream. With
children, it is necessary for the psychoanalyst to connect the manifest content with the latent content, and
this process will always be somewhat suspect (A. Freud, 1946). These problems lead into another controversy,
the age at which psychoanalysis can occur. Whereas Klein and her colleagues believed that psychoanalysis
could occur at any age, since babies are involved in play as part of their earliest activities, Anna Freud
believed that some amount of speech was necessary to form an adequate therapeutic relationship with a
child (so the earliest reasonable age for psychoanalysis would be around two to three years of age; A. Freud,
1946).
In her conclusion to

The Psycho-Analytical Treatment of Children,

Anna Freud re-emphasizes the role

that the developmental processes play as a child (and their id, ego, and superego) grows. As such, a child
analyst needs to be as intimately familiar with the normal sequence of child development as he is familiar
with the neurotic or psychotic disturbances of it (A. Freud, 1946).

She specically mentions academic

psychology and the tests being created by psychologists for the measurement of personality as useful in
this regard.

She also mentions one test as being especially useful in examining libido development and

its disturbances: the Rorschach test. Still, she acknowledges that our understanding of the developmental
processes of the libido and of the ego is very incomplete. Yet she cautions psychoanalytic investigators not
to conne examinations to short-cuts of any kind. . . (A. Freud, 1946). Clearly her concern for children, and
for a professional approach to psychoanalytic research and practice, were foremost in her mind.
So what does current research tell us about the eectiveness of psychoanalysis on children? As is often
the case, the results are not clear.

Although a number of studies have shown that children benet from

psychoanalysis, the degree of that benet has been disappointing (see Jarvis, 2004).

When children of

dierent age groups were studied, the results showed that psychoanalysis was more eective for younger
children than it was for adolescents, something that Anna Freud would probably not have predicted. An
important problem in many of the studies providing positive results, however, is that the results are based
on reports by the therapists. Such reports are highly subjective and open to bias (Jarvis, 2004). Also, as
we might expect, the eectiveness of psychoanalysis is dependent on the experience and skill of the analyst.
Typically, analysts who have experience teaching and supervising psychoanalysis, as well as those who are
prepared to try a variety of psychoanalytic techniques, achieve signicantly better outcomes with their
patients (Kernberg, 2004). So we must consider the question of the eectiveness of child psychoanalysis as
one that remains unanswered.

Discussion Question: Is a child at play engaging in the same mental activity as an adult engaged in free
association? Melanie Klein believed yes, but Anna Freud disagreed. Do you think that children are capable
of the same participatory role in psychoanalysis as adults, and is play the best way to observe children?
Late in her life and career, Anna Freud extended her work beyond the psychoanalytic treatment of
children to larger issues of child advocacy.

Yale University, and Albert Solnit, a professor of pediatrics and psychiatry at Yale's medical school and

Beyond the Best Interests of the
Before the Best Interests of the Child (Goldstein, A. Freud,

Director of the Child Study Center at Yale, she co-authored two books:

Child

(Goldstein, A. Freud, & Solnit, 1973) and

& Solnit, 1979).

These books focus on the importance of placing the interests of children rst when the

government intervenes in cases involving the custody and placement of children. These situations arise is
many circumstances, such as in the case of orphans or following a dicult divorce, but also in more extreme
cases of abuse or when certain parents do not believe in allowing medical care for very sick children. Since
these situations can pit one parent against another, or the parents against the interests of society, the authors
addressed very clearly reasons why the interests of the child should be placed rst:
Some will assert that the views presented in this volume are so child-oriented as to neglect the needs and
rights of the adults. In fact, this is not the case. There is nothing one-sided about our position, that the
child's interests should be the paramount consideration once, but not before, a child's placement becomes
the subject of ocial controversy. Its other side is that the law, to accord with the continuity guideline, must
safeguard the rights of any adults, serving as parents, to raise their children as they see t, free of intervention
by the state, and free of law-aided and law-abetted harassment by disappointed adult claimants.

To say

that a child's ongoing relationship with a specic adult, the psychological parent, must not be interrupted,
is also to say that this adult's rights are protected against intrusion by the state on behalf of other adults.
As set out in this volume, then, a child's placement should rest entirely on consideration for the child's
own inner situation and developmental needs. . . (Goldstein, A. Freud, & Solnit, 1973)
So long as the child is part of a viable family, his own interests are merged with those of the other
members. Only

after

the family fails in its function should the child's interests become a matter for state

intrusion. (Goldstein, A. Freud, & Solnit, 1979)

5.1 Object Relations Theory
There are those who say that it is inappropriate to refer to

object relations theory as if it were a single

theory. It is more appropriate to refer to object relations theorists, a group of psychoanalysts who share a
common interest in object relations, but whose theories tend to vary with each individual theorist. Sigmund
Freud used the term object to refer to any target of instinctual impulses. In the current context, an object is
a person, or some substitute for a person such as a blanket or a teddy bear, which is the aim of the relational
needs of a developing child. Melanie Klein is generally recognized as the rst object relations theorist, and
her change in emphasis from Sigmund Freud's view was rather profound.

Freud believed that a child is

born more like an animal than a human, driven entirely by instinctual impulses. Only after the ego and the
superego begin to develop is the child psychologically human. Klein, however, felt that a baby is born with
drives that include human objects, and the corresponding need for relationships. In other words, the infant's
instinctual impulses are designed to help the child adapt to the distinctly human world into which the child
is born (Mitchell & Black, 1995).

Melanie Klein
Melanie Klein (1882-1960) was also born in Vienna, about 13 years before Anna Freud. However, she
did not remain there. She moved rst to Budapest, where Klein entered into psychoanalysis with Sándor
Ferenczi. She then moved to Berlin, where she continued her psychoanalysis with Karl Abraham. Since the
move to Berlin occurred in 1921, and since she credited this period with Abraham much more signicantly
than the time she spent with Ferenczi, the most signicant portion of her psychoanalysis actually occurred
shortly after that of Anna Freud (Mitchell, 1986). However, the time periods are so close that, despite the
dierence in age, they really should be considered contemporaries. But they certainly did not agree, as we
have already seen.
There are two factors that contributed to the dierences between Klein and Anna Freud. Since Klein
underwent psychoanalysis with Ferenczi in Budapest, and then Abraham in Berlin, her exposure to multiple
points of view likely gave her a unique perspective on psychoanalysis. Anna Freud, remember, never left her
father's home while he was alive. Also, in 1925, just as the two women were embarking fully on their own
careers, Klein moved to England following the death of her mentor Karl Abraham. This separation from the
continent of Europe, in a country where analysts already shared ideas similar to Klein's, led to a freedom of

113

thought that allowed Klein to develop her own theories without restraint (Mitchell, 1986).
As mentioned above, Klein believed that an infant is born with the capacity and drive to relate to others.
An inherent problem with this reality, however, is that the infant must be prepared to deal with all types
of people and relationships. Thus, Klein believed that the death-instinct and its aggressive energy are every
bit as important as the life-instinct (Eros) and its libidinal energy:

. . .What then happens is that the libido enters upon a struggle with the destructive impulses and gradually
consolidates its positions. . .the vicious circle dominated by the death-instinct, in which aggression gives rise
to anxiety and anxiety reinforces aggression, can be broken through by the libidinal forces when these have
gained in strength. As we know, in the early stages of development the life-instinct has to exert its power
to the utmost in order to maintain itself against the death-instinct. But this very necessity stimulates the
growth of the sexual life of the individual. (pgs. 211-212; Klein, 1932/1963)
As the child continues to develop, love becomes the manifestation of the life-instinct, and hate becomes
the manifestation of the death-instinct (Mitchell, 1986). As for people in the child's life, the child will begin
to recognize both good and bad elements of their support for and relationship to the child. The child will
also recognize good and bad aspects of its own thoughts and behaviors. As a result, the child will begin a
process known as

splitting, in which the bad parts of an object are split o and not allowed to contaminate

the good parts of the object. In simpler terms, a child can continue to love its parents, even though there
may be times that the parents do not satisfy the impulses of the child. Similarly, the child can continue to
feel a positive sense of self-esteem, even though they sometimes fail or do bad things. Such split attitudes
can continue into adulthood, and we sometimes hear people talk about love-hate relationships.
Since the child is born with the life-instincts and death-instincts necessary to establish and maintain
object relations, Klein did not focus on development as going through a series of stages.

Instead, she

suggested two basic developmental orientations that help the child to reconcile its emotions and feelings

paranoid-schizoid position and the
depressive position (Jarvis, 2004; Kernberg, 2004; Mitchell, 1986; Mitchell & Black, 1995). The means

regarding the inner and outer worlds in which the child exists: the

by which the child processes these emotions and orientations is based largely on fantasy. Klein believed that
the child is capable at birth of an active fantasy-life. This fantasy emanates from within, and imagines what
is without, and it represents the child's primitive form of thinking about the world and about the child's
relationships (Jarvis, 2004; Kernberg, 2004; Mitchell, 1986).

With regard to the mother, the child's rst

object:
In the baby's mind, the `internal' mother is bound up with the `external' one, of whom she is a `double',
though one which at once undergoes alterations in his mind through the very process of internalization; that
is to say, her image is inuenced by his phantasies, and by internal stimuli and internal experiences of all
kinds. (pgs. 148-149; Klein, 1940/1986)
Klein believed that object relations are present at birth, and the rst object is the mother's breast (Klein,
1946/1986). Due, in part, to the trauma of birth, the child's destructive impulses are directed toward the
mother's breast from the beginning of life.
it begins to fear retaliation.

As the child fantasizes attacking and destroying its mother,

This leads to the paranoid position.

Because of this fear, and in order to

protect itself, the child begins the process of splitting the mother's breast and itself into good and bad parts
(the schizoid position). The child then relies on two principle defense mechanisms to reduce this anxiety:
introjection leads the child to incorporate the good parts of the object into itself, and projection involves
focusing the bad parts of the object and the child onto the external object. This introjection and projection
then provide the basis for the development of the ego and the superego (Klein, 1946/1986; Mitchell, 1986).
As the child continues to develop, it becomes intellectually capable of considering the mother, or any
other object, as a whole. In other words, the mother can be both good and bad. With this realization, the
child begins to feel guilt and sadness over the earlier fantasized destruction of the mother. This results in
the depressive position, and it represents an advancement of the child's maturity (Jarvis, 2004; Kernberg,
2004; Klein, 1946/1986; Mitchell, 1986).

Discussion Question: Melanie Klein is unique in her emphasis on aggression and the death-instinct.
Does it seem reasonable to consider aggression as important in human development as libido (and Eros)? Is
it possible that aggression was an essential element in the development of the human species, but one that

is no longer needed?
Another important contribution by Klein was the method of

play analysis. She acknowledged that

some psychoanalytic work had been done with children prior to 1920, particularly by Dr.

Hug-Hellmuth

(Klein, 1955/1986). Dr. Hug-Hellmuth used some drawings and play during psychoanalysis, but she did not
develop a specic technique and she did not work with any children under the age of 6.

Although Klein

believed that even younger children could be psychoanalyzed in the same manner as adults, that doesn't
mean they have the same ability to communicate as adults. Klein's interest in play analysis began with a
5 year-old boy known as `Fritz.'

Initially Klein worked with the child's mother, but when his symptoms

were not suciently relieved, Klein decided to psychoanalyze him. During the course of psychoanalysis, she
not only listened to the child's free associations, she observed his play and considered that to be an equally
valuable expression of the child's unconscious mind (Klein, 1955/1986). In

The Psycho-Analysis of Children

(1932/1963), she described the basics of the technique:
On a low table in my analytic room there are laid out a number of small toys of a primitive kind - little
wooden men and women, carts, carriages, motor-cars, trains, animals, bricks and houses, as well as paper,
scissors and pencils. Even a child that is usually inhibited in its play will at least glance at the toys or touch
them, and will soon give me a rst glimpse into its complexive life by the way in which it begins to play
with them or lays them aside, or by its general attitude toward them. (pg. 40)

Figure 5.1

Klein believed that by watching children at play an analyst can gain a deep understanding of the psychodynamic processes taking place in the child's mind.
It is interesting to note that although Anna Freud often commented on Klein's work, Klein seldom
mentioned Anna Freud. It may be that Anna Freud felt compelled to address the work of a leading gure
whom Anna Freud considered to be incorrect, whereas Klein felt no such need to address the work of the
younger Anna Freud. Klein certainly cited Sigmund Freud's work extensively, but when she mentioned Anna
Freud she typically failed to give credit where credit is due. For example, in

The Psycho-Analysis of Children

(Klein, 1932/1963), she mentions Anna Freud only once, in the introduction to the book:
Anna Freud has been led by her ndings in regard to the ego of the child to modify the classical technique, and has worked out her method of analysing children in the latency period quite independently of
my procedure. . .In her opinion children do not develop a transference-neurosis, so that a fundamental condition for analytical treatment is absent. . .My observations have taught me that children can quite well

115

produce a transference-neurosis, and that a transference-situation arises just as in the case of grown-up
persons. . .Moreover, in so far as it does so without having recourse to any educational inuence, analysis not
only does not weaken the child's ego, but actually strengthens it. (pg. 18-19)
This quote not only emphasizes a fundamental disagreement between Klein and Anna Freud, it also seems
to dismiss the value Anna Freud placed on her educational background. Later in her career, Klein even went
so far as to suggest that she herself was closer to Sigmund Freud's perspective than Anna Freud was:
I do not know Anna Freud's view about this aspect of Freud's work.

But, as regards the question of

auto-eroticism and narcissism, she seems only to have taken into account Freud's conclusion that an autoerotic and a narcissistic stage precede object relations, and not to have allowed for the other possibilities
implied in some of Freud's statements such as the ones I referred to above. This is one of the reasons why
the divergence between Anna Freud's conception and my conception of early infancy is far greater than that
between Freud's views, taken as a whole, and my view. (pg. 206; Klein, 1952/1986)
Clearly, whereas Anna Freud felt that Klein was reading too much into her analysis of children, Klein
felt that Anna Freud had failed to consider the wider perspectives allowed by the work of Sigmund Freud.
Given the complexity of individual personality, it may be that the true answer to this question is dierent
for each person undergoing psychoanalysis.

Placing the Neo-Freudians in Context - 2:
The Psychoanalysis of Children
Before continuing our examination of object relations theorists, it is important to stop and ask why the
psychoanalysis of children received so much attention. Many people think of early childhood as a carefree
time to run and play, a time when our parents take care of every need, and we have no responsibilities at all.
However, for many children, life holds much more challenging problems than just the normal psychological
processes of growing up. Abuse, neglect, being caught in the middle of a bitter divorce, these are just some
of the things that occur in the lives of too many children. In considering situations where society is forced
to intervene, Anna Freud and her colleagues believed that we should shift our focus from thinking about the
best interests of the child and think instead about providing the least detrimental available alternative
for safeguarding the child's growth and development (Goldstein, Freud, & Solnit, 1973). Their reasoning
was that in cases of abuse, neglect, divorce, etc., the best interests of the child are no longer possible, and
certainly cannot be restored by a judge. Therefore, the best that society can hope to do is to help the child
as much as possible. Obviously, psychotherapy may play an important role in this process for those children
who are emotionally disturbed.
The question remains, however: at how early an age can psychoanalysis be eective? The answer depends
somewhat on your perspective. As we have already seen, Anna Freud did not consider children capable of
fully participating in psychoanalysis as adults can; she did not consider their play behavior to be the same
thing as free association. Melanie Klein, however, did consider children to be good subjects for psychoanalysis
at very early ages. In fact, Klein took it one step further: she practically considered psychoanalysis necessary
for normal development! Klein's childhood was not easy. Her father seemed to care only for her sister Emilie,
and Emilie and their brother Emmanuel constantly harassed Klein. Her closest sister in age, Sidonie, took
pity on Klein and taught her arithmetic and how to read. However, when Klein was only 4 years old, both
she and Sidonie came down with tuberculosis. Sidonie died, and her death was very traumatic for Klein.
Klein suered from depression throughout her life, and even spent some time in a hospital being treated for
it during her 20s (Sayers, 1991; Segal, 2004). This may have had a lot to do with Klein's focus on the death
instinct and aggression during early childhood development. Her own descriptions of childhood can seem
quite frightening:
We get to look upon the child's fear of being devoured, or cut up, or torn to pieces, or its terror of being
surrounded and pursued by menacing gures, as a regular component of its mental life; and we know that
the man-eating wolf, the re-spewing dragon, and all the evil monsters out of myths and fairy stories ourish
and exert their unconscious inuence in the fantasy of each individual child, and it feels itself persecuted
and threatened by those evil shapes. (pgs. 254-255; Klein, 1930/1973)
Not only are such early childhood challenges frightening for individuals, Klein also believed that all
attempts to improve humanity as a whole have failed because no one has understood the full depth and vigor

of the aggressive instincts in each person. Klein believed that psychoanalysis could help both individuals and
all humanity by alleviating the anxiety caused by the hatred and fear that she proposed all children experience
during their psychodynamic development (Klein, 1930/1973). And so, Klein expressed the following desire
for psychoanalysis:

. . .I

hope, child analysis will become as much a part of every person's upbringing as school education is

now. Then, perhaps, that hostile attitude, springing from fear and suspicion, which is latent more or less
strongly in each human being, and which intensies a hundredfold in him every impulse of destruction, will
give way to kindlier and more trustful feelings toward his fellow men, and people may inhabit the world
together in greater peace and goodwill than they do now. (pgs. 267-268; Klein, 1930/1973).

Donald W. Winnicott
Anna Freud and Melanie Klein represent two extremes in the debate over the development of personality
in childhood and how psychoanalysis can help to understand that development and treat psychological
disorders.

Anna Freud strictly adhered to her father's theory, believing that young children lacked the

psychological development necessary for participating fully in adult-like psychoanalysis. Klein, on the other
hand, considered children quite advanced at birth, with the death-instinct and its aggressive impulses being
every bit as important as Eros and the libido. In contrast to these extremes, an independent school of object
relations theorists developed with more moderate views. Donald Winnicott was one of the most inuential
of these more moderate theorists, as were Margaret Mahler and Heinz Kohut. We will take a look at some
of the ideas of Mahler and Kohut in the next section.
Winnicott (1896-1971) was a pediatrician before becoming an analyst, so he brought a wealth of experience in observing mother-infant interactions to psychoanalysis. Already well respected for his medical
treatment of children, Winnicott became increasingly interested in their emotional disorders. So, he joined
a group of psychoanalysts being formed in London under the guidance of Sigmund Freud (Winnicott, Shepherd, & Davis, 1986).

His rst analyst was James Strachey, the man responsible for translating much of

Freud's work into English and who was also instrumental in bringing Klein to England. Winnicott continued
his analysis with Joan Riviere, one of Klein's closest colleagues, and he was eventually supervised by Klein
herself (Mitchell & Black, 1995). Due to his prior experience and independent spirit, however, he developed
his own theories separately from those of Klein.
Winnicott saw the early years of life as being a time when the child must transition from a state of

subjective omnipotence toward one of objective reality. When a newborn is hungry, the breast appears.
When a newborn is cold, it is wrapped in a blanket and warmed. The baby believes that it has created these
conditions through its own wishing, and so it feels omnipotent. The mother's responsibility during this time
is to cater to the baby's every wish, to anticipate the needs of the child. As a result, the baby does indeed
have its wishes granted almost immediately. This subjective sense of self, as an empowered individual, is
crucial to the core of personality as the child grows and represents the

true self (Kernberg, 2004; Mitchell

& Black, 1995; Winnicott, 1967/1986).
For this development to proceed in a healthy manner, the child must have what Winnicott called a good
enough mother (Winnicott, 1945/1996, 1968a,b/2002, 1968c/1986). The good enough mother at rst
fullls the child's wishes immediately and completely, but then withdraws when not needed. This creates an
environment in which the child is protected without realizing it is being protected. Over time, the mother
slowly withdraws even from the immediate satisfaction of the child's needs. This allows the child to develop
a sense of objective reality, the reality that the world does not immediately and completely satisfy anyone's
desires and needs, and that wishing does not lead to satisfaction. So the good enough mother is not a perfect
mother in the sense that she provides forever anything that the child wants. Instead, she does what is best
for the development of the child, oering fulllment and protection when needed, and withdrawing when
the child must pursue its own development. Winnicott considered the unique condition of the good enough
mother as something quite fascinating:
A good enough mother starts o with a high degree of adaptation to the baby's needs. That is what
good-enough means, this tremendous capacity that mothers ordinarily have to give themselves over to
identication with the baby...The mother is laying down the basis for the mental health of the baby, and

awkwardnesses that belong to growth and development. (pg. 234; Winnicott, 1968b/2002)

Figure 5.2

A good enough mother satises the needs of her child, but withdraws when the child does not need her,
eventually no longer being available to the child in an instant. Over time, this allows the child to develop a
realistic sense of the world.
Discussion Question: Donald Winnicott believed that healthy development required a child to have a
good enough mother. Do you think you had a good enough mother (or father), and do you agree with this
approach to raising an infant?
There is at least one big problem with discussing how extraordinary the good enough mother is:

it

seems to ignore the role of the father. However, this was not the case. Although Winnicott emphasized the
biological reality that the father does not share the same physiological relationship that the mother and child
share, he did acknowledge that in the course of development the father plays an important role (Winnicott,
1968b/2002, 1968c/1986). Thus, in considering the overall development of the child, he acknowledges the
role of good enough parents:
I must be careful. So easily in describing what very young children need I can seem to be wanting parents
to be seless angels, and expecting the world to be ideal. . .Of children, even of babies, it can be said that
they do not do well on mechanical perfection. They need human beings around them who both succeed and
fail.
I like to use the words good enough. Good enough parents can be used by babies and young children,
and good enough means you and me. In order to be consistent, and so to be predictable for our children, we
must be

ourselves.

If we are ourselves our children can get to know us. Certainly if we are acting a part we

shall be found out when we get caught without our make-up. (pg. 179; Winnicott, 1969/2002)
Objective reality is not, however, the goal of development. It is just as extreme as subjective omnipotence.
While it is true that wishing does not lead to satisfaction, it is also true that loved ones will help to satisfy
our needs and desires to the best of their ability. An individual living entirely in the realm of objective reality

lacks the subjective core of their true self and cannot connect with others. Instead, they live in expectation
of what others will do, inuenced entirely by external stimuli (Mitchell & Black, 1995). Such individuals
develop what is called a

false self disorder (Winnicott, 1964/1986, 1967/1986, 1971). Although Winnicott

described the false self as a successful defense, within the context of ongoing development, he did not consider
it to be a condition of psychological good health (Winnicott, 1964/1986, 1967/1986). However, it is part of
normal development in every person's life. For example, children are taught to say thank you even when
they may not be thankful for something. We actually teach them to lie, as part of the price for socialization.
However, some children nd it dicult because of the need to continually re-establish the importance of the
true self relative to the false self (Winnicott, 1964).
For Winnicott, the process of transitioning from subjective omnipotence toward objective reality is crucial
The transitional experience is not just a concept, however, since it often involves
transitional objects. A child's blanket, or a teddy bear, is very important to the child. They do not exist

to development.

merely as a substitute for the mother, they are also an extension of the child's own self. This allows the child
to experience a world that is neither entirely within its control nor entirely beyond its control (Kernberg,
2004; Mitchell & Black, 1995). Such a world is closer to the condition in which most of us actually live,
and ts well with Winnicott's denition of the good enough parent: one who is honest and real in dealing
with their children. The relationship between the child and its mother, as well as the relationships between
the child and its larger family, are actively involved in this transitional experience.

There is an intimate

connection between a mother and a child when they are playing, and that connection exists in a common
ground: the transitional space that is neither child nor mother. Because this is a shared and secret place, it
is a symbol of the trust and union between them. Taken further, this space becomes an opportunity for the
child to see itself

mirrored in the mother's face. If the mother is loving and supportive, the child is able to

develop a sense of feeling real (Winnicott, 1968a/2002). Although the relationship with the mother may be
the most special, these phenomena do carry over to the father and the rest of the family as well (Winnicott,
1966/2002).

Discussion Question: Winnicott felt that transitional objects were important for helping children to
develop without too much anxiety. Did you have a favorite transitional object, and do you still have it? Do
you think it is healthy for children to have such objects, and what might you do with your own children if
you have them? If you already have children, do they have transitional objects, and did you ever consciously
expect them to have them?

Table 5.2

For Winnicott, the psychoanalytic process was an opportunity for the patient to re-experience the early
subjective experiences of a relationship with the good enough mother. The therapist takes the role of the
good enough mother, allowing the patient to spontaneously be in the relationship, while the analyst tries
to anticipate and accommodate the patient's needs.

The hope is that the analyst and the therapeutic

environment will allow the patient's aborted development to be reanimated, with the patient's true self
emerging as a result (Mitchell & Black, 1995). However, there can be no single technique in this process,
as each case is dierent (Winnicott, 1971). More important than technique is the analyst's overall skill as
an analyst, their ability to make use of various techniques within the psychoanalytic session. Perhaps the
most important aspect of this overall view of what is necessary for eective psychoanalysis, according to
Winnicott, is that the analyst needs to have been a good, healthy candidate in the rst place. Winnicott
believed that it is not easy to turn a badly selected candidate into a good analyst. . . (Winnicott, 1971).
Although Winnicott may have felt that technique was not some special trick to be used by anyone in
performing psychoanalysis, he did have some favorite techniques. As described above, he watched the playful
interaction between child and mother, in much the same way as Klein used her play technique. Winnicott
also liked to use the

Squiggle Game, a technique that makes use of drawings by the child and the analyst,

including the opportunity for each to make changes in the other's drawings. Winnicott believed that this
process provided a special opportunity to make contact with the child, in which it felt to him as if the
child were alongside him helping to describe the case (Winnicott, 1971). In

In closing, Winnicott felt it was important to focus on psychological health, and he dened this as
something much more than simply making it through each day, going to work, and raising a family.

He

believed that healthy individuals actually lived three dierent lives: 1) a life in the world, with interpersonal
relationships being key; 2) a personal psychic reality, including creativity and dreams; and 3) their cultural
experience. Winnicott admitted that it was dicult to incorporate the cultural experience into the life of
an individual. However, he favored the transitional space between the child and its mother, and felt that
it was dependent on the mother having been very supportive of the child during development (Winnicott,
1967/1986). In considering the overall purpose of life, in contrast to Freud's perspective, Winnicott wrote:
...What is life about? I do not need to know the answer, but we can agree that it is more nearly about
BEING than about sex. . .Being and feeling real belong essentially to health, and it is only if we can take
being for granted that we can get on to the more positive things. . .the vast majority of people take feeling
real for granted, but at what cost? To what extent are they denying a fact, namely, that there could be
a danger for them of feeling unreal, of feeling possessed, of feeling they are not themselves, of falling for
ever, of having no orientation, of being detached from their bodies, of being annihilated, of being nothing,

denial of anything. (pgs. 34-35; Winnicott,

nowhere? Health is not associated with

1967/1986)

Margaret Mahler (1897-1985), was also a pediatrician before becoming a child analyst, and the early
relationship between a child and its mother had a signicant impact on her views of developmental ego
psychology. At birth, according to Mahler, a child is focused entirely on itself, in a state of primary
narcissism known as the normal autistic phase. In agreement with Sigmund Freud, Mahler believed
that in the rst few weeks of life there is very little cathexis of libido outside of the child itself. She borrowed
Freud's analogy of a bird's egg to describe this period in which the child has minimal interaction with
external stimuli. Through contact with the mother, however, the child slowly becomes aware that it cannot
satisfy its needs by itself. As the child becomes dimly aware of the mother's activities, the child begins to
think of itself and its mother as an inseparable system. This intimate connection between child and mother
is called

normal symbiosis (Kernberg, 2004; Mahler, Pine, & Bergman, 1975; Mitchell & Black, 1995).

As important as this stage is for the development of the child, the child still needs to develop a sense of
individuality. That process is known as

separation-individuation:

We refer to the psychological birth of the individual as the

separation-individuation process :

the estab-

lishment of a sense of separateness from, and relation to, a world of reality, particularly with regard to the

one's own body and to the principal representative of the world as the infant
primary love object. Like any intrapsychic process, this one reverberates throughout the
never nished; it remains always active. . .(pg. 3; Mahler, Pine, & Bergman, 1975)
experiences of

experiences it,

the

life cycle. It is

Separation-individuation, therefore, refers to the two main tasks that a young child must accomplish in
order to grow up. First, they must separate from their mother (including the psychological understanding
that they and their mother are two separate beings), and then they must fully develop their individualAccording to Mahler, this process involves a series of four subphases: dierentiation, practicing,
rapprochement, and consolidation. The earliest subphase, dierentiation, is signaled by the child's in-

ity.

creasing alertness around the age of 4 to 5 months. Following a hatching process, the child directs much
of its attention outward, but this alternates with the child often turning back to the mother as its point of
orientation. Transitional objects, as described by Winnicott, are also important during this period. As the
child becomes old enough to start crawling, it moves out into the world and begins practicing its ability to
interact with the environment. The practicing subphase enters full force as the child begins to walk, and
an important aspect of this is a full, physical understanding of the child's separateness from its mother.
Accordingly, its interests can now spill over into the many toys and other objects the child discovers in the
world (Kernberg, 2004; Mahler, Pine, & Bergman, 1975; Mitchell & Black, 1995).
During the rapprochement subphase (approximately 1

½

to 2 years of age), the child's psychological

development catches up with its physical development, and the child potentially enters a state of confusion
and anxiety. The child becomes aware that the mobility it gained during the practicing subphase has had
the unfortunate eect of truly, and physically, separating the child from its mother. The distress this causes
leads the child to regularly check in with its mother for security. This is a progressive stage, but is often seen

as a regression by the parents (Mitchell & Black, 1995). Pushing the child away too early at this stage can
lead to psychological problems later in life, and Mahler urged that one cannot emphasize too strongly the
importance of the mother providing optimal emotional availability to the child (Mahler, Pine, & Bergman,
1975). If all goes well, the child will then enter the nal subphase and consolidate a denite, and in some
aspects lifelong, individuality. Mahler believed that this process indicated a far-reaching structuralization of
the ego and denite signs that the child has internalized parental demands, an indication that the superego
has developed as well (Mahler, Pine, & Bergman, 1975).
Louise Kaplan, who worked with Mahler for a time, was interested in applying the theory Mahler had
developed to the full range of human life, both in terms of age and cultural dierences. Although Kaplan
agreed that the most profound development occurs during early childhood, she emphasized that the purpose
of all this, from the point of view of society, is what sort of person will grow out of each child.
In the rst three years of life every human being undergoes yet a second birth, in which he is born as a
psychological being possessing selfhood and separate identity. The quality of self an infant achieves in those
crucial three years will profoundly aect all of his subsequent existence. (pg. 15; Kaplan, 1978)
The conditions of these early years, however, are not always good. In many cultures women are oppressed,
sometimes violently. This has an eect on the mothering these women are able to provide their children.
Male children may be valued, but in a possessive way. Female children may be scorned, as they lack the
male privileges the mother wishes she had herself (Kaplan, 1978). Of course, not all cultures are like this.
Kaplan describes a wide variety of cultures, both primitive and modern, and considers some of the many
factors that contribute to the nature of adulthood.

She compared hunter/gatherer cultures such as the

Zhun/twasi or the Ik, tribes found in southern Africa, as they are compelled to transition from old ways of
life toward more modern ways. The increased aggressiveness and general life stress that Kaplan observed
coinciding with these changes in culture suggests to her that our modern way of life has led to many of
these psychological problems. She believed that in every adult human there still lives a helpless child who is
afraid of aloneness. When social conditions are competitive and/or abusive, adults are as alone and helpless
as children. According to Kaplan, this would be true even if there were perfect babies and perfect mothers
(Kaplan, 1978).

Discussion Question: Mahler believed that children develop through three stages. First the child
focuses on itself, then the child becomes aware of their intimate relationship with their mother, and nally a
sense of individuality develops. If you look at your relationship with your parents, which stage seems more
dominant: your narcissism, your symbiosis, or your separation-individuation?
Heinz Kohut (1913-1981) continued and expanded on this perspective of the important and revealing
relationship between childhood development and the life and psychological health (or not) of adults. Kohut was born in Vienna, and studied medicine at the University of Vienna, as Sigmund Freud had. Also
similar to Freud, he took some time to study medicine in Paris. In 1937, Kohut's father died and he was
deeply troubled. He rst went to a psychologist for treatment, but later sought psychoanalysis from August
Aichhorn. Aichhorn was a highly respected analyst, and a close personal friend of both Sigmund and Anna
Freud. The success of his analysis greatly interested Kohut himself, and led to his becoming an analyst as
well. After eeing Nazi controlled Austria in 1939, Kohut eventually settled in America. He continued his
psychoanalytic training at the Chicago Institute for Psychoanalysis (where Karen Horney had been the rst
associate director), but not without diculty.

Initially, Kohut was soundly rejected by the institute.

He

then entered into therapy with Ruth Eissler, a training and supervising analyst at the institute, and the
wife of a protégé of the well-respected Aichhorn. Making these connections was an intentional eort at good
networking, and Kohut was later accepted into training (Strozier, 2001).
In his theory, Kohut focused on the

self and narcissism. Most theorists express a negative view of

narcissism, but Kohut felt it served an essential role in the development of individuality. Early childhood is
a time of vitality, children are exuberant, expansive, and creative. Kohut was interested in the fate of this
vitality, and how it can be preserved into adulthood (Mitchell & Black, 1995). The development of a healthy
self depends on three kinds of

selfobject experiences. Selfobjects are the adults who care for the child,

and they need to provide for both physiological and psychological needs.

First, a child needs selfobjects

who conrm the child's vitality, who look on the child with joy and approval. In this rst basic narcissistic

process, known as

mirroring, the child is able to see itself as wonderful through the eyes of others. An

important aspect of mirroring is empathy, a state in which the mother and child actually share their feelings
as if they were one (Strozier, 2001). The second type of selfobject satises the child's need to be involved
with powerful others, people the child can look up to as images of calmness, control, and omnipotence. This
second basic narcissistic process, known as

idealizing, allows the child to experience the wonder of others,

and to consider itself special due to its relationship with them. Finally, the child needs to experience others
who are open and similar to the child, allowing the child to sense an essential likeness between the child
and the selfobject. Although this was not described as a basic narcissistic process, its lack of development
can be seen in the twinship transference described below. These various relationships will help the child to
develop a healthy narcissism, a realistic sense of self-esteem. Although reality will begin to chip away at this
narcissism, in a healthy environment the child will survive the occasional frustration and disappointment and
develop a secure, resilient self that maintains some kernel of the vitality of early childhood into adulthood
(Mitchell & Black, 1995).
An important question, however, is how are the selfobjects incorporated into the child's sense of self ? As
suggested above, mirroring is the rst important step. As the child observes the mother's joy and approval
of the child, the child comes to believe that it must be wonderful. Why else would the mother be so happy
to see the child? Similarly, as the child observes selfobjects that are powerful and calm, those selfobjects
the child has idealized, the child projects the best part of itself onto those selfobjects. Accordingly, the child
sees those selfobjects as wonderful and, since the child is with them, the child must be wonderful too. In
these instances the child strengthens its own sense of self, its own narcissism, in comparison to others. These
processes can be seen in the psychoanalytic session with patients who have not developed a healthy sense of

mirroring transference,
idealizing transference, and twinship transference. In mirroring transference, the attention of the

self. They will exhibit three types of selfobject transference toward the analyst:

analyst allows the patient to feel more real and more internally substantial. In idealizing transference, the
patient comes to believe that the analyst is an important and powerful person, and the patient is to be
valued by virtue of their association with the analyst. And nally, in twinship transference, the patient feels
as if they are a companion to the analyst in the process of therapy (Mitchell & Black, 1995; Strozier, 2001).

Discussion Question: Heinz Kohut also considered a degree of narcissism to be necessary for a child to
develop a sense of individuality. Are you more likely to choose friends who admire you (mirroring), or whom
you admire (idealizing)? Or do you choose friends who are similar to you, and who help you to develop a
realistic sense of self (twinship)? In each instance, is your choice an overwhelming desire, or just one aspect
of choosing your friends?
Late in his career Kohut turned his attention to a topic that had also captured Sigmund Freud's attention
late in his career: God and religion. Kohut felt that Freud had made a crucial error in evaluating religion.
Freud believed that religion would be undone by the study of science, but Kohut felt that it was simply
wrong to try evaluating religion in a scientic way. He did not consider God to be an internalized image
of the frightening and all-powerful father, but rather an internalization of the earliest and most wonderful
relationship in life: the love of a mother (Strozier, 2001). In keeping with his basic theory, he tried to outline
the precise psychological needs that were being satised by religion. Most importantly, there is something
uplifting about religion. The mirroring need is typically referred to as grace, the gifts freely given to us by
God, something psychologically similar to the love shown by a mother holding and cuddling her beloved
child. God is, of course, the ultimate in idealization, a perfect being, all-knowing and all-powerful. While
an immense and ornate cathedral or temple may seem awesome to those who are religious, other spiritual
people can be similarly impressed looking down from a mountaintop, walking along the ocean shore, or
listening to beautiful music. As for the nal selfobject need, twinship, one can easily relate the community
of a religious congregation.

Perhaps it is no coincidence that we often hear priests and ministers talking

about a congregation as the children of God. Although it was never quite clear what Kohut's own religious
or spiritual beliefs were, he did write:
There is something about this world in our experience that does lift us up beyond the simplicity of an
individual existence, that lifts us into something higher, enduring, or, as I would rather say, timeless. (pg.
332; quoted in Strozier, 2001)

Connections Across Cultures: Cultural Perspectives
on Parent-Child Attachment
This is a true story. I was at our local gym while my older son was at gymnastics practice. There were
some children attending a party at the gym, including a little boy about 2 years old who was running around
on one of the gymnastics oors.

He fell down and hurt himself, and he started crying.

A couple of the

coaches walked over to help him, but he just cried louder and roughly turned away from them. Then he
heard his mother calling him. He ran over to his mother, crying all the way, and she scooped him up into
her arms. Almost immediately he stopped crying, started squirming around, and when she put him down
he raced back onto the oor and started running wildly in circles and yelling for joy! This is a marvelous
example of what psychologists call a secure attachment.
Attachment theory was developed by John Bowlby and advanced by Mary Ainsworth (see Jarvis, 2004;
Mitchell & Black, 1995; Rothbaum, Weisz, Pott, Miyake, & Morelli, 2000). Bowlby considered attachment
theory to t within an object relations approach to psychodynamic theory, but it was largely rejected by the
psychodynamic community. He proposed an evolutionary basis for attachment, a basis that serves the species
by aiding in the survival of the infant. In other words, the attachment between an infant and its primary
caregivers helps to ensure both that the infant stays close to the parents (the objects, if we consider object
relations theory) and the parents respond quickly and appropriately to the needs of the infant. Ainsworth
studied the attachment styles of children using a technique called the

strange situation. In the strange

situation, one of the caregivers (let's say the mother) takes a child into an unfamiliar playroom, and allows
the child to explore. A stranger enters, interacts with the mother, and then tries to interact with the child.
The mother leaves, then returns, the stranger leaves, and then the mother leaves again. The stranger then
returns, then leaves, and nally the mother returns. Throughout all of these events, the child is observed
for evidence of having a secure base (feeling comfortable enough to explore the unfamiliar room), separation
anxiety (due to the absence of the mother), stranger anxiety (due to the presence of the stranger), and,
nally, for its attachment to its mother (when the mother returns at the end of the experiment) (Jarvis,
2004). A securely attached child, as in the story above, will feel free to explore a new environment. When
hurt or frightened, however, the child will seek its mother for protection and comfort. Having found that
comfort, having armed its secure base, the child will then venture out again. But is this true for children
in all cultures?
It has been suggested that attachment theory and interpretations of the strange situation are embedded
in Western perspectives and ideals, particularly those of middle-class White Americans.

In particular, a

secure attachment seems to promote the independence of the child, and its ability to separate from the
mother and move out into the world.

One of the key measures of a secure attachment is that child is

comforted by the presence of its mother, particularly after the child has been in the presence of strangers.
However, numerous cultural problems arise from these perspectives. For example, in many African American
households children are raised by dierent members of an extended family, possible including individuals who
are not related to the family. Thus, African American children raised in such an environment may respond
quite dierently to the strange situation, it may not be novel to them (Belgrave & Allison, 2006).

As

mentioned briey in Chapter 1, Kenneth and Mamie Clark were two very important individuals who studied
the development of African American children. Respectively, they were the rst African American man and
African American woman to receive Ph.D. degrees in psychology. In addition to studying racial identication
in African American children during the 1940s (Clark & Clark, 1947), they established what became the
Northside Center for Child Development in Harlem, New York. Primarily under Mamie Clark's guidance, the
center provided a broad range of psychological services including consultations for behavioral and emotional
problems, vocational guidance for adolescents, and child-rearing education for African American parents. In
addition, the center provided the same services for a smaller number of White and Puerto Rican children
from working-class families in Harlem.

Mamie Clark's goal was to give the children of Harlem the same

sense of emotional security that she had enjoyed as a child, a sense of security that was elusive in the poor
neighborhoods of Harlem (Lal, 2002).
Rothbaum et al. (2000) compared American perspectives on attachment to those in Japan, a country
with similar socioeconomic conditions but a very dierent history and culture. Attachment theory has been

considered to have three, universal core hypotheses: sensitivity, competence, and the secure base. In order
for a child to feel secure, the mother must respond quickly and appropriately when the child perceives a
threat. In other words, she must be sensitive to the child's needs. When a child feels secure, and has a secure
relationship with its primary caregivers, attachment theory predicts that the child will grow up socially and
emotionally competent. And nally, the secure base is intimately linked with the child's exploration of the
environment and the child's ability to respond appropriately to environmental stimuli.
If we compare Japan to the United States, and how we dene each of the factors listed above, we
come to very dierent conclusions. According to Rothbaum et al. (2000), so-called sensitive parents in the
United States emphasize the child's autonomy. They expect their children to explore the environment, and
they wait for their children to express their needs before responding.

In Japan, however, mothers try to

anticipate their children's needs, and they promote the child's dependence on its mother. In Japan, mothers
emphasize emotion and social factors, as opposed to communication and physical objects. Similar dierences
are seen with regard to social competence. An American who grows up socially competent (assumed to be
the result of secure attachments in childhood) is expected to be independent and self-sucient, willing to
express and defend their own opinions. In Japan, however, as in all typical collectivist cultures, a socially
competent adult is expected to be dependent on the social in-group and emotionally restrained (Rothbaum
et al., 2000). With regard to the secure base, in the United States it is expected to encourage the child's
autonomy, exploration, and general orientation to the environment rst. In contrast, Japanese children are
encouraged to focus more on their mothers, in both distressing situations and in those involving positive
emotions.

Since the expectations of each aspect of attachment theory are so dierent in Japan and the

United States, which are assumed to be representative of Western and Eastern societies, Rothbaum et al.
(2000) question whether attachment theory itself is truly universal. They do not question that children and
their parents form important and deeply meaningful attachments, but they do question whether attachment
can be reasonably evaluated the same way in all cultures.
There are other researchers, however, who question whether the perspectives of Rothbaum et al. (2000)
justify rejecting the universality of attachment theory. For example, Posada and Jacobs (2001) acknowledge
dierences in behavior among dierent cultures, but they emphasize that all children have the potential for
developing secure base relations with their parents and the subsequent secure attachments. It is important
to keep in mind that Bowlby's theory was originally proposed in an evolutionary context and humans are,
after all, primates.

Also, Ainsworth rst coined the term

secure base relationship

after studying a rural,

African community in Uganda, not in a Western culture (Posada and Jacobs, 2001). Rothbaum et al. (2000)
also suggest that the relationship between Japanese mothers and their children is better expressed by

amae ,

a dependence on and presumption of another's love. Amae has been described as what a child feels when
seeking his or her mother (consider the child in the story at the beginning of this section, as he ran crying
to his mother). However, when the question is asked in the right way, Japanese mothers would prefer their
children to t a denition of a secure child as opposed to one experiencing amae (van IJzendoorn and Sagi,
2001).

Indeed, the very meaning of amae is not clearly understood, and may not be easily compared to

behaviors recognized in Western cultures (Gjerde, 2001). It may also be true that insecure relationships may
be more adaptive in some cultures than secure attachments, and our misunderstanding of these concepts does
not allow us to conclude which perspective on attachment theory, if any, should be preferred (Kondo-Ikemura,
2001).
Finally, since attachment problems do sometimes arise, and since attachment must be dened within
a relational context, is an individual therapy such as psychoanalysis the best course?

If family therapy

might be a better option in some circumstances, is anything being done to address cultural issues there?
Fortunately, the answer is yes. Psychologists have begun comparing and contrasting family therapy in such
diverse cultures as Japan, Israel, and the U.S. Virgin Islands (Dudley-Grant, 2001; Halpern, 2001; Kameguchi
& Murphy-Shigematsu, 2001; see also Kaslow, 2001). In keeping with the hopeful sentiments that Melanie
Klein expressed regarding child psychoanalysis, Kaslow (2001) believes that family psychology has a role to
play in undertaking the challenges of working with and for families in creating a healthier, more peaceful,
less violent world for all.

A Contemporary Perspective: Otto Kernberg

Available for free at Connexions <http://cnx.org/content/col11901/1.1>

125

Otto Kernberg (1928-present) is one of the leading gures in psychodynamic theory today.

Kernberg

has focused on two major paths: trying to integrate the various psychodynamic, ego psychology, and object
relations theories into a unied perspective and trying to provide a research-based methodology for the
treatment of patients, particularly patients with

borderline personality organization (a pathological

identity formation that includes all of the major personality disorders; Kernberg, 2004, Kernberg & Caligor,
2005).
Despite seemingly signicant dierences between Freud's classical theory and the theories of the neoFreudians we have examined above (as well as others we have not looked at), Kernberg has done an admirable
job of bringing the theories into a cohesive framework. This was accomplished by setting up a hierarchical
series of developmental levels at which failure to develop normally causes characteristic types of disorders,
whereas successful development leads to a healthy individual. In contrast to Freud, Kernberg believes that
an infant begins life as an emotional being unable to separate its own reality from others around it. As the
child experiences object relations in this rst stage of development, those emotions develop into the drives
described by Freud: pleasant emotions lead to libidinal drives and unpleasant emotions lead to aggressive
drives. During the second stage of development, the child's continued development in relation to others leads
to an understanding that objects can be both negative and positive (the process of splitting described by
Klein), and this leads to a reduction in the intensity of love and hate toward those objects. In other words,
the child can love awed individuals, since the child does not need to completely love or completely hate the
important objects in their life. In simple terms, according to Kernberg, individuals who fail to accomplish
the rst stage of development, an understanding that they are separate from others, develop psychotic
disorders. Individuals who fail to accomplish the splitting necessary in the second stage of development will
develop borderline disorders, characterized by an exaggerated xation on bad self and object representations
(Kernberg, 2004). Completing these rst two stages does not end the process, however, because the third level
is the one described by Freud himself: the developmental stage in which unconscious id (emotional) impulses
threaten the individual's sense of what is good and acceptable behavior. Thus, classic neurotic disorders still
potentially face those who have moved beyond the more severe psychological pathologies of psychotic and
borderline conditions (Kernberg, 2004; Mitchell & Black, 1995). We will examine Kernberg's theory in more
detail at the end of the chapter, where we will examine his psychoanalytic theory of personality disorders.
In 2004, Kernberg published an excellent book entitled

Theory, Techniques, and Their Applications.

Contemporary Controversies in Psychoanalytic

In this chapter we have seen that many disagreements arose

between neo-Freudian theorists, and at rst glance their theories seem to disagree more than they agree.
Kernberg, however, has this to say:
Psychoanalytic object relations theories constitute so broad a spectrum of approaches that it might be said
that psychoanalysis itself, by its very nature, is an object relations theory: all psychoanalytic theorizing deals,
after all, with the impact of early object relations on the genesis of unconscious conict, the development of
psychic structure, and the re-actualization or enactments of past pathogenic internalized object relations in
transference developments in the current psychoanalytic situation. (pg. 26; Kernberg, 2004)
He oers an excellent summary of the basic elements of theorists we have examined (Klein, Winnicott,
Sullivan, Mahler), as well as some we haven't (Fairbairn, Jacobson), and how their theories can be blended
with classical Freudian psychoanalytic theory. He then examines how psychoanalysts today are addressing a
wide variety of unresolved topics, including: Freud's dual-drive theory (libido and aggression), homosexuality
and bisexuality, mourning and depression, social violence, and the resistance among many in the eld of
psychoanalysis to improved research and changes in psychoanalytic education and training (Kernberg, 2004).
In the nal chapter of his book on

Contemporary Controversies. . .,

Kernberg examines the historical

progression of psychoanalytic thought in English speaking countries (the so-called English schools).

The

controversial discussions of the 1940s led to a mutual agreement to disagree among three major lines of
thought: the ego psychologists following Anna Freud, the object relations theorists following Melanie Klein,
and the independent school that included D. W. Winnicott.

Although the result of these discussion was

to delineate the dierences among these approaches, over time practicing psychoanalysts recognized the
limitations of each approach (Kernberg, 2004). So, many theorists and clinicians began bringing together
those elements of each approach that were most valuable. Along the way came some very dierent perspec-

tives, such as those of Kohut and his self psychology and the culturalist views of Sullivan, and the eld was
changed dramatically. Kernberg also contrasts these developments to those within the French school of psychoanalysis, a somewhat more traditional approach that emphasizes psychoanalytic method over technique
(Kernberg, 2004). He concludes by suggesting that the future of psychoanalytic thought may be a blending
of the English and French schools (Kernberg, 2004). One notable early French psychoanalyst was Princess
Marie Bonaparte, a personal friend of Sigmund and Anna Freud. We will briey look at her contributions
to psychoanalytic theory in a later chapter.

Personality Theory in Real Life: Kernberg's Psychoanalytic
Theory of Personality Disorders
Otto Kernberg is one of the leading gures advocating a psychoanalytic theory of personality disorders,
particularly within an object relations perspective (see Kernberg & Caligor, 2005). In important ways he has
followed the model of Sigmund Freud, in that he has based much of this theory on experience psychoanalyzing
patients. His theory has been developed in conjunction with the therapeutic approach that grew out of both
that experience and his developing theory. Thus, Kernberg's work represents an applied approach to the
study of personality disorders.
Kernberg's model of personality disorder emphasizes personality structures, which are derived from the
interaction of constitutional (i.e., temperamental) and environmental factors during early childhood. These
structures are relatively stable mental functions or processes that serve to organize an individual's behavior
and subjective experiences. Psychological structures that are conscious and observable are typically referred
to as

surface structures, whereas those that are primarily unconscious are called deep structures.

The basic building blocks of these personality structures are internalized object relations. Internalized object
relations are particular emotional states linked to a specic image of a particular relationship (e.g., anxiety
linked with an image of a confused and unsure self and a critical, judgmental parent).

These internal

object relations are integrated and hierarchically organized into the higher-order structures that form the
personality. At the core of this personality organization is the individual's

identity. According to Kernberg

and Caligor (2005), a healthy, consolidated identity corresponds with a stable and realistic sense of self and
others.

In contrast, a pathological identity stems from an unstable, polarized, and unrealistic sense of

self and others. This pathology arises because the emotional states of the internalized object relations are
predominately negative; they are crude, intense, and poorly modulated. There is also a preponderance of
aggression and defensive mechanisms based on primitive dissociation (splitting).
A normal personality, according to Kernberg, is characterized by an integrated concept of self and an
integrated concept of signicant others.

Individuals with a normal personality can express a wide range

of emotions, and even intense emotions do not lead to a loss of impulse control. Normal individuals have
an integrated and mature system of internalized values, and they can appropriately manage their sexual,
dependent, and aggressive motivations. The development of the normal personality depends to a large extent
on the relationship the child has with its mother (the primary caregiver). If the mother is successful in helping
the child transform highly emotional states into integrated experiences, then the child's internalized object
relations will be primarily positive. Erik Erikson rst proposed this concept, and he believed that ego identity
was not complete until adolescence (see Kernberg & Caligor, 2005).
The abnormal personality, in contrast, results from early childhood interactions with caregivers who
do not help to transform highly emotional states into integrated experiences. On the contrary, caregiver's
failure to help the child integrate its emotional experiences can intensify the child's anger and anxiety,
perhaps leading to an increase in aggression. Consequently, a child who cannot integrate the good and bad
aspects of its emotional states and object relations will come to depend on defense mechanisms that enhance
continued splitting. The child becomes xated at a poorly integrated level of development. One of the most
important implications of this approach to personality disorders is the role that primary caregivers play.
What constitutes a parent, or other caregiver, who cannot help the child to integrate its emotional states in
a healthy, normal manner? Numerous studies in dierent countries have identied a high rate of physical
and sexual abuse in patients with borderline disorders.
The level at which integration fails to occur results in the nature of the pathological personality organization. A psychotic personality organization occurs when the individual has not integrated a clear concept

of self and signicant others.

They do not have a clear identity formation, they may not distinguish in-

trapsychic processes from external stimuli, and therefore there may be a lack of reality testing. According to
Kernberg, psychotic personality organization represents an atypical form of psychosis (Kernberg & Caligor,
2005). Borderline personality organization is similar, but less severe. The individual has achieved a level
of integration in which the self and others are seen as separate, but that integration is pathological. There
is a great deal of defensive splitting, and the individual lacks a clearly developed set of internalized values
(the superego).

Emotion uctuates from intense to supercial, emotion is generally negative, and there

may be excessive aggression. There is also a lack of integration of the sense of others, making relationships
particularly unstable and unrealistic. Curiously, achieving an integrated sense of self and others does not
resolve all psychological problems associated with personality development. Even if an individual has moved
beyond the stages of psychotic and borderline personality development, and developed an integrated sense
of self and others, they may still be prone to neurotic personality organization. At this level, defenses are
based primarily on repression and stable reality testing. This is the level at which Sigmund Freud studied
personality and psychological disorders, according to Kernberg (2004).
With this perspective in mind, how then do we treat individuals with personality disorders? Kernberg's
primary focus is an exploration of the patient's internal object relations. These pathological internal object
relations play out in the patient's current interpersonal relationships, and through the process of transference
they play out in the therapeutic relationship as well. In patients with neurotic personality disorganization
these transferences are relatively stable and understandable within a psychoanalytic context.

With more

severe personality organizations, the transferences are poorly organized, unstable, unrealistic, and the activation of the internal object relations can be immediate and chaotic.

There is also a rapid interchange

between the roles played by the patient with regard to which object of an internal object relation they
identify with, and, accordingly, which object they attribute as the analyst. With severe borderline patients
special attention must always be paid to the strong tendency toward acting out, which can lead to suicide
attempts, drug abuse, self-mutilation, and other aggressive behavior (Kernberg & Caligor, 2005).
Therapy with these patients is a long and dicult task.

In order for psychoanalysis to be successful,

it may require multiple sessions each week for 4 to 6 years. This is necessary because the goal is no less
ambitious than modifying personality organization and the quality of the patient's internal object relations,
all of which were laid down during the formative years of infancy and early childhood (Kernberg & Caligor,
2005). Within the context of this theory, the outcome for individuals with a neurotic personality organization
is hopeful, whereas the outcome for those with a borderline personality organization remains challenging.
Kernberg and Caligor (2005) do not propose an approach to the treatment of patients with a psychotic
personality organization. Therefore, continued research and clinical application will be necessary if we hope
to be able to treat all patients suering from personality disorders.

5.2 Review of Key Points
•

The neo-Freudians, also known as ego psychologists, remained true to much of Freud's original theory,
but they shifted their focus from the id to the ego.

•

Anna Freud began her career as a teacher. This concern for children continued throughout her career,
much of which was spent caring for children at the Hampstead War Nursery (which later became the
Hampstead Clinic, and is now called the Anna Freud Centre, as a tribute to the career of Anna Freud).

•

Anna Freud established ego psychology, believing that it made more sense to focus on the conscious
ego, which we can observe directly, than on the unconscious id.

•

As her father had, Anna Freud described defense mechanisms as the means by which the ego avoids the
anxiety associated with being unable to meet the demands of the id or the constraints of the superego.

•

There are a wide variety of defense mechanisms, which are generally oriented toward protecting us
from internal threats (id impulses) or external threats (the rules and expectations of society).

•

Anna Freud was one of the rst psychoanalysts to work with children, and she used the same basic
approach that she did with adults.

•

Later in her career, Anna Freud accepted that even very young children (under the age of 6) could

benet from psychoanalysis, but she insisted that they could not cooperate with the psychoanalyst in
the same way as an adult.

•

When working with children, Anna Freud felt it was important to ll in gaps that the child could not
(such as connecting manifest and latent content in dreams). She also believed that the psychoanalyst
should help to educate the child with regard to his/her relationships.

•

Object relations theory emphasizes that children are born with the capacity and drive to relate to
others.

•

Since all aspects of relationships have importance, Melanie Klein proposed that the death-instinct and
aggression are just as important as the life-instinct (Eros) and libido.

•
•

Splitting is an important process that involves recognizing the good and bad aspects of objects.
Klein proposed that an infant goes through two developmental orientations:

the paranoid-schizoid

position later develops into the depressive position.

•

One of Klein's major contributions was the method of play analysis. She felt that observing the play
of children could reveal as much unconscious material as free association by adults.

•

Anna Freud and Melanie Klein disagreed about how fully the child could be psychoanalyzed, and how
young they could be during psychoanalysis.

•

According to Winnicott, a child must transition from a state of subjective omnipotence toward one of
objective reality.

•

In order for a child to develop a healthy personality and realize their true self, according to Winnicott,
the child must have a good enough mother (and good enough parents).

•
•

When development does not follow a healthy path, children can develop a false self disorder.
The transitional experience that children must go through may be facilitated by transitional objects
(such as a blanket or teddy bear).

•

For Winnicott, the primary purpose of therapy is to provide an opportunity for the patient to reexperience the relationship of a good enough mother.

•

Winnicott was an advocate of the Squiggle Game, a therapeutic technique that allows children to draw
pictures to represent their thoughts and feelings.

•

Mahler believed that children begin life in a state of primary narcissism known as the normal autistic
phase. As they become aware of their mother they enter into normal symbiosis.

•

In order for the child to develop a sense of individuality, according to Mahler, the child must go through
a process known as separation-individuation.

•

Louise Kaplan, a student and colleague of Mahler, suggested that much of the stress experienced during
development is the result of societal changes, and that modern cultures exacerbate this stress.

•
•

Kohut believed that a certain measure of narcissism was necessary for the development of individuality.
According to Kohut, children need several types of selfobjects. They will see themselves mirrored in the
eyes of others, they will idealize others, and they will develop a realistic sense of self-esteem through
relationships with others.

•

During psychoanalysis, the analyst can provide each of these types of relationships through mirroring
transference, idealizing transference, and twinship transference. This allows the patient to feel more
real and more substantial.

•

Kohut questioned Freud's rejection of religion. He oered a point of view in which religion fullls a
variety of basic psychological needs for people.

•

Otto Kernberg has oered a perspective that blends all of the neo-Freudian and object relations theories
together, suggesting that they represent a continuum of stages in human development.

Karen Horney and Erich Fromm

Karen Horney stands alone as the only women recognized as worthy of her own chapter in many personality
textbooks, and the signicance of her work certainly merits that honor. She did not, however, focus her entire
career on the psychology of women. Horney came to believe that culture was more important than gender in
determining dierences between men and women. After refuting some of Freud's theories on women, Horney
shifted her focus to the development of basic anxiety in children, and the lifelong interpersonal relationship
styles and intrapsychic conicts that determine our personality and our personal adjustment.
Personally, Horney was a complex woman. Jack Rubins, who knew Horney during the last few years of
her life, interviewed many people who knew her and came away with conicting views:
She was described variously as both frail and powerful, both open and reticent, both warm and reserved,
both close and detached, both a leader and needing to be led, both timid and awesome, both simple and
profound. From these characterizations, the impression emerges that she was not only a complex personality
but changeable and constantly changing. She was able to encompass and unify, though with struggle, many
diverse attitudes and traits. . . (pg. 13; Rubins, 1972)
Erich Fromm, who was a lay-analyst with a Ph.D. (not an M.D. like most early psychoanalysts), focused
even more than Horney on social inuences, particularly one's relationship with society itself. He not only
knew and worked with Horney personally, but the two were intimately involved for a number of years, and
Fromm analyzed Horney's daughter Marianne. Both Horney and Fromm can be seen as extending Adler's
emphasis on social interest and cooperation (or the lack thereof ), and their belief that individuals pursue
safety and security to overcome their anxiety is similar to Adler's concept of striving for superiority.

Brief Biography of Karen Horney
Karen Clementine Theodore Danielssen was born on September 16

th

, 1885, in Hamburg, Germany. Her

father was Norwegian by birth, but had become a German national. A successful sailor, he had become the
captain of his own ship, and his family accompanied him on a few of his voyages, including trips around Cape
Horn, along the west coast of South America, and as far north as San Diego in the United States. Those
trips established a life-long interest in travel, foreign customs, and diversity in the young Karen Horney.
Although her father was a stern and repressive man, her mother, who was Dutch and 17 years younger than
Horney's father, was a dynamic, intelligent, and beautiful woman who maintained a very happy home for
the children (Kelman, 1971; Rubins, 1972, 1978).
From early childhood, Horney enjoyed reading, studying, and going to school.

She was particularly

interested in the novels of Karl May, who often wrote about the Native Americans, and Horney would play
many games in which she pretended to be an Indian (usually, Chief Winnetou, a ctional character from
May's novels). Her father believed that education was only for men, but her mother encouraged Horney's
schooling, and in doing so, set an example of independence that greatly inuenced Horney's life and career.
Horney followed the traditional education of the day, covering science, math, French, Latin, English, and the
humanities. She also took special classes in speech, and for a time was very interested in dancing, drama,

and the theatre.

Despite the challenging curriculum, she was an excellent student, and often placed rst

in her class. After being impressed by a friendly country doctor when she was 12, she decided to pursue a
career in medicine. When she began college at the University of Freiburg-in-Breisgau, at the age of 20, her
mother came along to get her settled in and care for her. Horney soon became good friends with Ida Grote,
who moved in with Horney and her mother to help oset the costs of attending college. In 1906, Horney
also met her future husband, Oskar Horney (Kelman, 1971; Rubins, 1972, 1978).
Over the next few years, she began her medical studies at the University of Gottingen, and then transferred to the University of Berlin, where she received her medical degree in 1911. In 1909 she had married
Oskar Horney, who was described as a tall, slim, handsome man, a brilliant thinker, gifted organizer, and
possessing great physical and emotional strength. He also attended the University of Berlin, eventually receiving doctorate degrees in Law, Economics, and Political Science! They soon had three daughters, Brigitte,
Marianne, and Renate (between 1911 and 1915).

Both Karen and Oskar Horney were successful in their

careers during the beginning of their marriage. He worked as a lawyer for a munitions company, and did
very well nancially. She was actively developing her medical career, but had to work that much harder due
to continued discrimination against women at the time. Still, the family spent time together on weekends,
when her brother's family often visited, and vacations. Nonetheless, the Horneys grew apart during these
years. In 1923, during the turmoil following World War I, Oskar's investments collapsed, and he eventually
went bankrupt. A year later, he was stricken with severe encephalomeningitis, and spent 8 months in critical
condition. These events radically altered his personality, as he became a broken and depressed person. In
1926 they separated, and never got back together. It was not, however, until 1939 that Karen Horney legally
divorced her husband (Kelman, 1971; Rubins, 1972, 1978).
For Karen Horney's career, the years in Berlin were important and productive. She entered into psychoanalysis with Karl Abraham, and later she was also analyzed by Hanns Sachs for a brief time. Abraham
appointed her as an instructor in the Berlin Psychoanalytic Poliklinik in 1919, and brought her to the attention of Sigmund Freud (with high praise). She came to know many of the candidates for psychoanalytic
training, and also became friends with many of them, including Melanie Klein, Wilhelm Reich, and Erich
Fromm. She also had many friends outside psychoanalytic circles, including the existential theologian Paul
Tillich and the neurologist Kurt Goldstein (who coined the term self-actualization).

The psychoanalytic

scene in Berlin was active and dynamic, and Horney was very much in the middle of it all, never shy about
expressing her own ideas and dierent opinions. One such issue was that of training lay-analysts (psychologists, as opposed to psychiatrists). She favored allowing the training for the purposes of research, but clearly
favored medical training for those who would actually practice therapeutic psychoanalysis. This eventually
led to conict between Horney and her close friend Erich Fromm. Despite the many favorable circumstances
in Berlin at the time, in the early 1930s Hitler was elected, and the Nazi regime began. Although Horney
was not Jewish, psychoanalysis was considered a Jewish science. So, when Franz Alexander, who had been
asked to come to Chicago to establish a new psychoanalytic training institute, asked her to be the Associate
Director of the newly established Chicago Institute of Psychoanalysis, she accepted (Kelman, 1971; Rubins,
1972, 1978). This dramatic turn in the events of her life did not, however, occur without a bit of chance.
Alexander had rst asked Helene Deutsch, one of the rst women to join Freud's psychoanalytic group (see
Sayers, 1991), but Deutsch was not interested at the time.

Thus, Horney was the second choice for the

position that brought her to America for the rest of her life (Kelman, 1971; Rubins, 1972, 1978).
Once in Chicago, however, her theoretical dierences with Alexander became a clear source of disagreement. Alexander was not willing, as Horney was, to discard signicant elements of Freud's original theories.
So, just 2 years later, in 1934, Horney moved to New York City and joined the New York Psychoanalytic
Institute. A number of her friends from Berlin had also come to New York, including Erich Fromm and Paul
Tillich, and Wilhelm Reich also visited her there. She soon met Harry Stack Sullivan and Clara Thompson,
as they were establishing their new training institute in New York. She also began teaching at the New School
for Social Research, and the American Institute for Psychoanalysis. Her private practice grew steadily, and
Alvin Johnson, the president of the New School (as it is commonly known) introduced her to W. W. Norton,
who established a well-known publishing house that produced all of Horney's books.

(1946), and

Harold Kelman (who was both a friend and colleague) brought together a number of her early papers in

Feminine Psychology

(Kelman, 1967), and, as a special tribute, Douglas Ingram published the transcripts

of her nal lectures, presented during a class she taught in the fall of 1952 (Ingram, 1987).
During the 1930s and 1940s, Horney's personal life was a social whirlwind. She entertained frequently,
often cooking herself, and when her own home was in disarray she would arrange the party at a friend's
home. She bought and sold vacation homes often, including one where Oskar Horney stayed for a time, and
she traveled frequently. She enjoyed playing cards, and wanted to win so much that she would sometimes
cheat! When caught, she would freely admit it, laugh, and say that her opponents should have stopped her
sooner. Sometimes she would even gather her friends together and loudly sing German songs, in memory of
their homeland (Kelman, 1971; Rubins, 1972, 1978).
At work, however, there was constant tension regarding theoretical and political issues in the psychoanalytic societies. In 1941, the New York Psychoanalytic Institute voted to disqualify Horney as a training
analyst, due to her seemingly radical ideas on psychoanalytic techniques.

Half the society did not vote,

however, and they soon left to form a new institute. Immediately following the vote, Horney walked out,
and a group of analysts led by Clara Thompson followed her. The very same month, twenty analysts joined
Horney in forming the Association for the Advancement of Psychoanalysis, and Horney was asked to become
the Dean of their soon to be established American Institute for Psychoanalysis. When Thompson suggested
that Sullivan be granted honorary membership, and Horney recommended the same for Fromm, Fromm
refused because he was not going to be recognized as a clinical psychoanalyst.

The resulting controversy

led to a committee review, which voted against Fromm's membership. Among others, Fromm, Thompson,
and Sullivan left the society. There were other political battles as well, and Horney was routinely torn between her professional beliefs, her need to control the direction of the society and institute, and her personal
friendships with the individuals involved. Through it all, although she held strong beliefs (such as opposing
therapeutic psychoanalysis by lay-analysts like Fromm), she nonetheless encouraged challenging the original
theories developed by Freud, as well as her own theories:
I recall being impressed by her response at my rst meeting with her, when I indicated my own curiosity
and bent for research. She had warmly hoped I would continue this way, since her views needed further work
and clarication. Indeed, during an interview in 1952, she stated that she knew her ideas would be changed,
if not by herself by someone else. (pg. 37; Rubins, 1972)
By 1950, Horney seemed to be feeling lonely and isolated. Perhaps the political and theoretical battles
had taken their toll, perhaps it was her strained relationships with her daughters (they were never really
close), or perhaps it was the beginning of the cancer that would eventually take her life. Although Horney
would not consult with her physician about the abdominal pains she was experiencing (thus she did not know
that she had cancer), she did begin to develop strong spiritual interests. She occasionally attended Tillich's
sermons at St. John the Divine Church, though she seemed more interested in the philosophical and ethical
aspects of religion than the spiritual aspects. She kept a copy of Aldous Huxley's

The Perennial Philosophy

(1945/2004) by her bedside for over a year, reading daily on Huxley's interpretations of Eastern and Western
mystics. A few years earlier she had met D. T. Suzuki, and she became particularly interested in Zen. She
was especially impressed by a book he recommended entitled

Zen in the Art of Archery

(Herrigel, 1953;

based on an article he wrote in 1936). In 1951, Suzuki led Horney on a trip to Japan, where she visited a
number of Zen temples and had lengthy discussions with Zen monks. Although she seemed more interested
in the practical aspects of being a student of Zen, she nonetheless endeavored to put Zen principles into
a context she could understand (such as equating enlightenment with self-realization; Rubins, 1972, 1978).
Late in 1952, her cancer became so advanced that she nally sought medical care. However, it was too late.
On December 4, 1952, she died peacefully, surrounded by daughters.

One of the rst women trained in psychoanalysis, she was the rst to challenge Freud's views on women.
She did not, however, attempt to reject his inuence, but rather, felt that she honored him by building upon
his achievements. The most signicant change that she felt needed to be made was a shift away from the
biological/medical model of Freud to one in which cultural factors were at least as important. Indeed, she
challenged Freud's fundamental belief that anxiety follows biological impulses, and instead suggested that
our behaviors adapt themselves to a fundamental anxiety associated with the simple desire for survival and
to cultural determinants of abnormal, anxiety-provoking situations.
Horney was also signicant in the development of psychodynamic theory and psychoanalysis in America.
She helped to establish psychoanalytic societies and training institutes in Chicago and New York. She was
a friend and colleague to many inuential psychoanalysts, including Harry Stack Sullivan and Erich Fromm.
She encouraged cross-cultural research and practice through her own example, not only citing the work of
anthropologists and sociologists, but also through her personal interest and support for the study of Zen
Buddhism.
Although Horney herself abandoned the study of feminine psychology, suggesting instead that it represented the cultural eect of women being an oppressed minority group, her subsequent emphasis on the
importance of relationships and interpersonal psychodynamic processes laid the foundation for later theories
on the psychology of women (such as the relational-cultural model). Thus, her inuence is still being felt
quite strongly today.

Horney's Shifting Perspectives on Psychodynamic Theory
Horney did not establish a specic theory of personality. Rather, her career proceeded through a series of
stages in which she addressed the issues that were of particular concern to her at the time. Accordingly, her
theories can be grouped into three stages: feminine psychology, culture and disturbed human relationships,
and nally, the mature theory in which she focused on the distinction between interpersonal and intrapsychic
defenses (Paris, 1994).

Feminine Psychology
Horney was neither the rst, nor the only, signicant woman in the early days of psychodynamic theory
and psychoanalysis. However, women such as Helene Deutsch, Marie Bonaparte, Anna Freud, and Melanie
Klein remained faithful to Freud's basic theories. In contrast, Horney directly challenged Freud's theories,
and oered her own alternatives. In doing so, she oered a very dierent perspective on the psychology of
women and personality development in girls and women. Her papers have been collected and published in

Feminine Psychology

by her friend and colleague Harold Kelman (1967), and an excellent overview of their

content can be found in the biography written by Rubins (1978).

On the Genesis of the Castration Complex in Women (Horney, 1923/1967)
The Flight from Womanhood (Horney, 1926/1967), Horney challenged the Freudian perspective on the

In her rst two papers,
and

psychological development of females. Although she acknowledged Freud's pioneering theories, even as they
applied to women, she believed that they suered from a male perspective, and that the men who originally
oered these theories simply did not understand the feminine perspective. Horney agreed that girls develop
penis envy, but not that it is the only dynamic force inuencing development during the phallic stage. Girls
envy the ability of boys to urinate standing up, the fact that boys can see their genitals, and the relative
ease with which boys can satisfy their desire for masturbation. More important for girls than penis envy,
however, was the fear and anxiety young girls experience with regard to vaginal injury were they to actually
have intercourse with their fathers (which, Horney agreed, they may fantasize).

Thus, they experience a

female genital anxiety. Another element of the castration complex in women,
according to Horney, was the consequence of castration fantasies that she called wounded womanhood
unique dynamic force called

(incorporating the belief that the girl had been castrated).
Far more important than these basic processes, however, was the male bias inherent in society and culture.
The very name

phallic

stage implies that only someone with a phallus (penis) can achieve sexual satisfaction

and healthy personality development.

Girls are repeatedly made to feel inferior to boys, feminine values

are considered inferior to masculine values, even motherhood is considered a burden for women to bear
(according to the Bible, the pain of childbirth is a curse from God!). In addition, male-dominated societies
do not provide women with adequate outlets for their creative drives. As a result, many women develop a

masculinity complex, involving feelings of revenge against men and the rejection of their own feminine
traits.

Thus, it may be true that women are more likely to suer from anxiety and other psychological

disorders, but this is not due to an inherent inferiority as proposed by Freud. Rather, women nd it dicult
in a patriarchal society to fulll their personal development in accordance with their individual personality
(unless they naturally happen to t into society's expectations).
Perhaps the most curious aspect of these early studies was the fact that Horney turned the tables on
Freud and his concept of penis envy. The female's biological role in childbirth is vastly superior (if that is
a proper term) to that of the male. Horney noted that many boys express an intense envy of pregnancy
and motherhood. If this so-called

womb envy is the male counterpart of penis envy, which is the greater

problem? Horney suggests that the apparently greater need of men to depreciate women is a reection of
their unconscious feelings of inferiority, due to the very limited role they play in childbirth and the raising
of children (particularly breast-feeding infants, which they cannot do). In addition, the powerful creative
drives and excessive ambition that are characteristic of many men can be viewed, according to Horney, as
overcompensation for their limited role in parenting. Thus, as wonderful and intimate as motherhood may
be, it can be a burden in the sense that the men who dominate society have turned it against women. This
is, of course, an illogical state of aairs, since the children being born and raised by women are also the
children of the very men who then feel inferior and psychologically threatened.
In a later paper, Horney (1932/1967) carried these ideas a step further. She suggested that, during the
Oedipus stage, boys naturally judge the size of their penis as inadequate sexually with regard to their mother.
They dread this inadequacy, which leads to anxiety and fear of rejection. This proves to be quite frustrating,
and in accordance with the frustration-aggression hypothesis, the boy becomes angry and aggressive toward
his mother. For men who are unable to overcome this issue, their adult sexual life becomes an ongoing eort
to conquer and possess as many women as possible (a narcissistic overcompensation for their feelings of
inadequacy). Unfortunately, according to Horney, these men become very upset with any woman who then
expects a long-term or meaningful relationship, since that would require him to then prove his manhood in
other, non-sexual ways.
For women, one of the most signicant problems that results from these development processes is a
desperate need to be in a relationship with a man, which Horney addressed in two of her last papers on
feminine psychology:

The Overvaluation of Love

(1934/1967) and

The Neurotic Need for Love

(1937/1967).

She recognized in many of her patients an obsession with having a relationship with a man, so much so that
all other aspects of life seem unimportant. While others had considered this an inherent characteristic of
women, Horney insisted that characteristics such as this

overvaluation of love always include a signicant

portion of tradition and culture. Thus, it is not an inherent need in women, but one that has accompanied
the patriarchal society's demeaning of women, leading to low self-esteem that can only be overcome within
society by becoming a wife and mother. Indeed, Horney found that many women suer an intense fear of
not being normal. Unfortunately, as noted above, the men these women are seeking relationships with are
themselves seeking to

avoid

long-term relationships (due to their own insecurities). This results in an intense

and destructive attitude of rivalry between women (at least, those women caught up in this neurotic need for
love). When a woman loses a man to another woman, which may happen again and again, the situation can
lead to depression, permanent feelings of insecurity with regard to feminine self-esteem, and profound anger
toward other women. If these feelings are repressed, and remain primarily unconscious, the eect is that the
woman searches within her own personality for answers to her failure to maintain the coveted relationship
with a man.

She may feel shame, believe that she is ugly, or imagine that she has some physical defect.

Horney described the potential intensity of these feelings as self-tormenting.
In 1935, just a few years after coming to America, Horney rather abruptly stopped studying the psychology of women (though her last paper on the subject was not published until 1937). Bernard Paris found
the transcript of a talk that Horney had delivered that year to the National Federation of Professional and
Business Women's Clubs, which provided her reasoning for this change in her professional direction (see
Paris, 1994). First, Horney suggested that women should be suspicious of any general interest in feminine
psychology, since it usually represents an eort by men to keep women in their subservient position. In order
to avoid competition, men praise the values of being a loving wife and mother. When women accept these

same values, they themselves begin to demean any other pursuits in life. They become a teacher because
they consider themselves unattractive to men, or they go into business because they aren't feminine and lack
sex appeal (Horney, cited in Paris, 1994). The emphasis on attracting men and having children leads to a
cult of beauty and charm, and the overvaluation of love. The consequence of this tragic situation is that
as women become mature, they become more anxious due to their fear of displeasing men:

. . .The young woman feels a temporary security because of her ability to attract men, but mature women
can hardly hope to escape being devalued even in their own eyes. And this feeling of inferiority robs them
of the strength for action which rightly belongs to maturity.
Inferiority feelings are the most common evil of our time and our culture. To be sure we do not die of
them, but I think they are nevertheless more disastrous to happiness and progress than cancer or tuberculosis.
(pg. 236; Horney cited in Paris, 1994)
The key to the preceding quote is Horney's reference to culture. Having been in America for a few years
at this point, she was already questioning the dierence between the greater opportunities for women in
America than in Europe (though the dierence was merely relative). She also emphasized that when women
are demeaned by society, this had negative consequences on men and children. Thus, she wanted to break
away from any perspective that led to challenges between men and women:

. . .First of all we need to understand that there are no unalterable qualities of inferiority of our sex due to
laws of God or of nature. Our limitations are, for the greater part, culturally and socially conditioned. Men
who have lived under the same conditions for a long time have developed similar attitudes and shortcomings.
Once and for all we should stop bothering about what is feminine and what is not. Such concerns only
undermine our energies. . .In the meantime what we can do is to work together for the full development of
the human personalities of all for the sake of general welfare. (pg. 238; Horney cited in Paris, 1994)
In her nal paper on feminine psychology, Horney (1937/1967) concludes her discussion of the neurotic
need for love with a general discussion of the relationship between anxiety and the need for love. Of course,
this is true for both boys and girls. This conclusion provided a clear transition from Horney's study of the
psychology of women to her more general perspectives on human development, beginning with the child's
need for security and the anxiety that arises when that security seems threatened.

Discussion Question: After a number of years studying feminine psychology, Horney came to believe
that women are no dierent than any other minority group, and she began to pursue dierent directions
in her career. Are the problems faced by women dierent than other minority groups? If so, how are they
dierent?

Anxiety and Culture
In the introduction to

The Neurotic Personality of Our Time,

Horney (1937) makes three important

points. First, she acknowledged that neuroses have their roots in childhood experiences, but she also considered the experiences of adulthood to be equally important. Second, she believed that neuroses can only
develop within a cultural context. They may stem from individual experience, but their form and expression
are intimately tied to one's cultural setting. And nally, she emphasized that she was not rejecting Freud's
basic theory. Though she disagreed with many of his ideas, she considered it an honor to build upon the
foundation of his gigantic achievements. To do so, she wrote, helps to avoid the danger of stagnation. If
any more evidence than her word was necessary to demonstrate her loyalty to Freud, in this introduction we
also nd mention of Alfred Adler. Although Horney acknowledges some similarities with Adler's perspective,
she insists that her ideas are grounded in Freudian theory, and she describes Adler's work as having become
sterile and one-sided.
Horney believed that anxiety was a natural state of all living things, something the German philosophers
had called

Angst der Kreatur (anxiety of the creature), a feeling that one is helpless against such forces

as illness, old age, and death. We rst experience this anxiety as infants, and it remains with us throughout
life. It does not, however, lead to neurotic anxiety. But if a child is not cared for, if their anxiety is not
alleviated by the protection of their parents, the child may develop

basic anxiety:

The condition that is fostered. . .is an insidiously increasing, all-pervading feeling of being lonely and
helpless in a hostile world. . .This attitude as such does not constitute a neurosis but it is the nutritive soil
out of which a denite neurosis may develop at any time. (pg. 89; Horney, 1937)

135

Thus, in contrast to Freud's belief that anxiety followed the threat of id impulses breaking free of the
unconscious mind, Horney places anxiety before behavior. The child, through interactions with other people
(particularly the parents), strives to alleviate its anxiety.

If the child does not nd support, then basic

anxiety develops, and neurotic disorders become a distinct possibility. From that point forward, the child's
drives and impulses are motivated by anxiety, rather than being the cause of anxiety as proposed by Freud.
Basic anxiety is considered basic for two reasons, one of which is that it is the source of neuroses. The other
reason is that it arises out of early, but disturbed, relationships with the parents. This leads to feelings of
hostility toward the parents, and Horney considered there to be a very close connection between anxiety and
hostility. And yet, the child remains dependent on the parents, so it must not exhibit that hostility. This
creates a vicious circle in which more anxiety is experienced, followed by more hostility, etc. Unresolved, these
psychological processes leave the child feeling not only basic anxiety, but also

basic hostility (Horney, 1937;

May, 1977). In order to deal with this basic anxiety and basic hostility, Horney proposed both interpersonal
and intrapsychic strategies of defense (which we will examine in the next two sections). First, however, let's
take a brief, closer look at Horney's views on culture and anxiety.
A neurotic individual, simply put, is someone whose anxiety levels and behavior are signicantly dierent
than normal.

What is normal, of course, can only be dened within a cultural context.

Horney cited a

number of famous anthropologists and sociologists to support this claim, including Margaret Mead and
Ruth Benedict. She cites H. Scudder Mekeel's somewhat famous example of Native Americans having high
regard for individuals who have visions and hallucinations, since those visions are considered to be special
gifts, indeed blessings, from the spirits.

This is in sharp contrast to the standard Western view, which

considers hallucinations to be a symptom of psychosis. And yet, Native Americans are not fundamentally
dierent than Westerners. Only one year after Horney's book was published, Mekeel led Erik Erikson on the
rst of Erikson's studies of Native American development, which led Erikson to conclude that his stages of
psychosocial crisis were valid, since they seemed to apply to Europeans, European-Americans, and Native
Americans. After citing many such examples, from simple matters such as preferred foods to complex matters
such as attitudes toward murder, Horney concluded that every aspect of human life, including personality,
was intimately tied to cultural factors:
It is no longer valid to suppose that a new psychological nding reveals a universal trend inherent in
human nature. . .This in turn means that if we know the cultural conditions under which we live we have a
good chance of gaining a much deeper understanding of the special character of normal feelings and attitudes.
(pg. 19; Horney, 1937)
This emphasis on culture, however, should not be confused with the importance of individuality. Anxieties and neurotic symptoms exist within individuals, and present themselves within personal relationships.
Culture, once again, merely guides the nature or form of those anxieties. In Western culture, we are driven
primarily by economic and individual competition. Thus, other people are seen as competitors, or rivals.
For one person to gain something, another must lose. As a result, according to Horney, there is a diuse
hostile tension pervading all of our relationships.

For those who cannot resolve this tension, most likely

due to having experienced the culturally determined anxieties in exaggerated form during a dysfunctional
childhood, they become neurotic. Accordingly, Horney described the neurotic individual as a stepchild of
our culture (Horney, 1937).

Interpersonal Strategies of Defense
Horney considered inner conicts, and the personality disturbances they cause, to be the source of all
psychological illness. In other words, calm, well-balanced individuals do not suer psychological disorders
(consider the stress-diathesis model of abnormal psychology). Although Freud approached this concept in
his work, it was those who followed him, such as Franz Alexander, Otto Rank, Wilhelm Reich, and Harald
Schultz-Nencke, who dened it more clearly.

Still, Horney felt they all failed to understand the precise

nature and dynamics of character structure, because they did not take into account the cultural inuences.
It was only during her own work on feminine psychology that Horney came to the full understanding of these
psychodynamic processes (at least, in her own view; Horney, 1945).
At the core of these conicts is a

basic conict, which Freud described as being between one's desire for

immediate and total satisfaction (the id) and the forbidding environment, such as the parents and society (the

CHAPTER 6. KAREN HORNEY AND ERICH FROMM

136

superego). Horney generally agreed with Freud on this concept, but she did not consider the basic conict
to be basic. Rather, she considered it an essential aspect of only the neurotic personality. Thus, it is a basic
conict in the neurotic individual, one which expresses itself in the person's predominant style of relating to

moving
toward people, moving against people, and moving away from people (Horney, 1945). Although they

others. The three general attitudes that arise as neurotic attempts to solve conict are known as

provide a way for neurotics to attempt solutions in their disturbed interpersonal relationships, they achieve
only an articial balance, which creates new conicts. These new conicts create greater hostility, anxiety,
and alienation, thus continuing a vicious circle, which Horney believed could be broken by psychoanalysis.
Psychoanalysis is important for understanding neurotic individuals in part because they build a defensive
structure around their basic conict. Their behavior, according to Horney, reects more of their eorts to
solve conicts, rather than the basic conict itself. Thus, the basic conict becomes so deeply embedded
in the personality, that it can never be seen in its pure form. Nonetheless, when one of the basic character
attitudes becomes predominant, we can observe characteristic behaviors that reect the neurotic failure to
resolve one's inner conicts.
Moving toward people, also known as the

compliant personality, incorporates needs for aection and

approval, and a special need for a partner who will fulll all of one's expectations of life. These needs are
characteristic of neurotic trends: they are compulsive, indiscriminate, and they generate anxiety when they
are frustrated. In addition, they operate independently of one's feelings toward or value of the person who is
the object of those needs (Horney, 1945). In order to ensure the continued support of others, the compliant
individual will do almost anything to maintain relationships, but they give themselves over so completely
that they may enjoy nothing for themselves. They begin to feel weak and helpless, and they subordinate
themselves to others, thinking that everyone is smarter, more attractive, and more worthwhile than they
are. They rate themselves by the opinions of others, so much so that any rejection can be catastrophic. Love
becomes the most compulsive desire, but their lack of self-esteem makes true love dicult.

Accordingly,

sexual relations become a substitute for love, as well as the evidence that they are loved and desired.
Just as the compliant type clings to the belief that people are nice, and is continually baed by evidence
to the contrary, so the aggressive type takes it for granted that everyone is hostile, and refuses to admit that
they are not. To him life is a struggle of all against all, and the devil take the hindmost. (pg. 63; Horney,
1945)
As noted in the preceding quote, those who move against people, the

aggressive personality, are driven

by a need to control others. They view the world in a Darwinian sense, a world dominated by survival of the
ttest, where the strong annihilate the weak. The aggressive person may seem polite and fair-minded, but
it is mostly a front, put up in order to facilitate their own goals. They may be openly aggressive, or they
may choose to manipulate others indirectly, sometimes preferring to be the power behind the throne. Love,
which is such a desperate need for the compliant person, is of little consequence for the aggressive person.
They may very well be in love, and they may marry, but they are more concerned in what they can get out
of the relationship. They tend to choose mates for their attractiveness, prestige, or wealth. What is most
important is how their mate can enhance their own social position. They are keen competitors, looking for
any evidence of weakness or ambition in others. Unfortunately, they also tend to suppress emotion in their
lives, making it dicult, if not impossible, to enjoy life.
Those who move away from people, the

detached personality, are not merely seeking meaningful

solitude. Instead, they are driven to avoid other people because of the unbearable strain of associating with
others. In addition, they are estranged from themselves, they do not know who they are, or what they love,
desire, value, or believe. Horney described them as zombies, able to work and function like living people,
but there is no life in them. A crucial element appears to be their desire to put emotional distance between
themselves and others. They become very self-sucient and private. Since these individuals seek negative
goals,

not

to be involved,

not

to need help,

not

to be bothered, as opposed to having clear goals (needing

a loving partner or needing to control others) their behavior is more subject to variability, but the focus
remains on being detached from others in order to avoid facing the conicts within their psyche (Horney,
1945).
Each of these three character attitudes has within it some value. It is important and healthy to maintain

137

relationships with others (moving toward), ambition and a drive to excel have denite benets in many
cultures (moving against), and peaceful solitude, a chance to get away from it all, can be very refreshing
(moving away). The healthy individual is likely able to make use of each of these solutions in the appropriate
situations. When someone needs our help, we reach out to them. If someone tries to take advantage of us,
we stand up for ourselves. When the daily hassles of life wear us down, we retreat into solitude for a short
time, maybe exercising, going to a movie, or listening to our favorite music. As Horney attempted to make
very clear, the neurotic individual is marked by a compulsion to use one style of relating to others, and they
do so to their own detriment.

Connections Across Cultures: Cultural Dierences in
Interpersonal Relationship Styles
As Horney repeatedly pointed out, neurotic behavior can only be viewed as such within a cultural context.
Thus, in the competitive and individualistic Western world, our cultural tendencies are likely to favor moving
against and moving away from others. The same is

not

true in many other cultures.

Exchange relationships are based on the expectation of some return on one's investment in the relationship. Communal
relationships, in contrast, occur when one person feels responsible for the well-being of the other person(s).
Relationships can exist in two basic styles: exchange or communal relationships.

In African and African-American cultures we are much more likely to nd communal relationships, and
interpersonal relationships are considered to be a core value amongst people of African descent (Belgrave &
Allison, 2006). While there may be a tendency in Western culture to consider this dependence on others
as somehow weak, it provides a source of emotional attachment, need fulllment, and the inuence and
involvement of people in each other's activities and lives.
Cultural dierences also come into play in love and marriage. In America, passionate love tends to be
favored, whereas in China companionate love is favored. African cultures seem to fall somewhere in between
(Belgrave & Allison, 2006).

When considering the divorce rate in America, as compared to many other

countries, it has been suggested that Americans marry the person they love, whereas people in many other
cultures love the person they marry. In a study involving people from India, Pakistan, Thailand, Mexico,
Brazil, Japan, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Australia, England, and the United States, it was found that
individualistic cultures placed greater importance on the role of love in choosing to get married, and also
on the loss of love as sucient justication for divorce.

For intercultural marriages, these dierences are

a signicant, though not insurmountable, source of conict (Matsumoto & Juang, 2004).

Attempting to

maintain awareness of cultural dierences when relationship conicts occur, rather than attributing the
conict to the personality of the other person, can be an important rst step in resolving intercultural
conict. However, it must also be remembered that dierent cultures acknowledge and tolerate conict to
dierent extents (Brislin, 2000; Matsumoto, 1997; Okun, Fried, & Okun, 1999; for a brief discussion of
intergroup dialogue and conict resolution options, see Miller & Garran, 2008).
These cultural dierences are so fundamental, that even at the level of considering basic intelligence we
see the eects of these contrasting perspectives. In a study on the Kiganda culture (within the country of
Uganda, in Africa), Wober (1974) found that they consider intelligence to be more externally directed than
we do, and they view successful social climbing and social interaction as evidence of intelligent behavior.
This matches the attitude amongst Mediterranean cultures that notable people will be devoted to a life of
public service (in contrast, the word idiot is derived from a Greek word meaning a private man).
Thus, moving toward others would be favored much more in other cultures than it might be in the
Western world. Consequently, a signicant attitude and the behavior of moving toward others would be less
likely to be viewed as neurotic. Such issues are, of course, very important as we interact with people of other
cultures, as we may consider their behavior to be odd according to our standards. Naturally, they may be
thinking the same thing about us. What is probably most important is that we learn about and experience
other cultures, so that dierences in customs and behavior are not surprising when they occur.
There are two other mechanisms that Horney suggested are used by people in their attempts to resolve
inner conict: the

idealized image, and externalization (Horney, 1945). The idealized image is a creation

of what the person believes themselves to be, or what they feel they can or ought to be. It is always attering,
and quite removed from reality. The individual may see themselves as beautiful, powerful, saintly, or a genius.

Consequently, they become quite arrogant. The more unrealistic their view is, the more compulsive their
need for armation and recognition. Since they need no conrmation of what they know to be true, they
are particularly sensitive when questioned about their false claims! The idealized image is not to be confused
with authentic ideals. Ideals are goals, they have a dynamic quality, they arouse incentive to achieve those
goals, and they are important for personal growth and development. Having genuine ideals tends to result in
humility. The idealized image, in contrast, is static, and it hinders growth by denying or condemning one's
shortcomings.
The idealized image can provide a temporary refuge from the basic conict, but when the tension between
the actual self and the idealized image becomes unbearable, there is nothing within the self to fall back on.
Consequently, an extreme attempt at a solution is to run away from the self entirely.

Externalization is

the tendency to experience one's own psychodynamic processes as having occurred outside oneself, and then
blaming others for one's own problems. Such individuals become dependent on others, because they become
preoccupied with changing, reforming, punishing, or impressing those individuals who are responsible for
their own well-being. A particularly unfortunate consequence of externalization is a feeling Horney described
as a gnawing sense of emptiness and shallowness (pg. 117; Horney, 1945). However, rather than allowing
themselves to feel the emotion, they might experience it as an empty feeling in the stomach, and attempt
to satisfy themselves by, for example, overeating.

Overall, the self-contempt they feel is externalized in

two basic ways: either despising others, or feeling that others despise them. Either way, it is easy to see
how damaged the individual's personal relationships would become. Horney described externalization as a
process of self-elimination, which aggravates the very process with set it in motion: the conict between the
person and their environment.

Discussion Question: Horney described three basic attitudes regarding other people: moving toward,
moving against, or moving away from them. Do you easily use all three styles of relating to others, or do
you tend to rely on one more than the others? Does this create problems in your relationships?

Intrapsychic Strategies of Defense
In Neurosis and Human Growth,
realization.

Horney (1950) addressed the psychodynamic struggle toward self-

She described a series of psychological events that occur in the development of a neurotic

personality, and how they interfere with the healthy psychological growth of the

real self. Indeed, neurotic

symptoms arise out of the conict between the real self, our deep source of growth, and the idealized image.
She began this book with a simple statement as to why she focused so much of her work on neurotic
personalities:
The neurotic process is a special form of human development, and - because of the waste of constructive
energies which it involves - is a particularly unfortunate one. (pg. 13; Horney, 1950)
Horney believed in an innate potentiality within all people, which she referred to as growth toward
self-realization. The real self underlies this tendency toward self-realization, but it can be diverted by
the development of basic anxiety. In order to overcome basic anxiety, the child adopts one of the strategies
described above, attempting to solve its conicts by moving toward, against, or away from others. Under
adverse conditions, the child adopts one of these strategies in a rigid and extreme fashion, and begins
the neurotic development. And yet, the tendency toward self-realization remains deep within the psyche,
demanding that the neurotic development seek some higher level. Thus, the idealized image is formed, and
a variety of intrapsychic processes begin an attempt to justify oneself based upon that idealized image.
The establishment of the idealized image involves self-glorication, and it reects a need to lift oneself
above others. The psychic energy associated with self-realization is shifted toward realization of the idealized

search for glory (Horney, 1950). The search for
need for perfection,
which aims at the complete molding of the personality into the idealized self, and a drive for neurotic
ambition, or striving for external success. The most damaging element of the search for glory, however,
is the drive toward vindictive triumph. The aim of vindictive triumph is to put others to shame, or to
image, establishing a general drive that Horney called the

glory includes several elements, which are manifested as drives or needs. There is a

defeat them, through one's own success. Horney considered this drive to be vindictive because its motivating
source is the desire to take revenge for humiliations suered in childhood (i.e., to pay others back for the
circumstances that created basic anxiety).

139

The elements of the search for glory are not necessarily bad. Who wouldn't want to be perfect, ambitious,
and triumphant?

However, in their compulsive and neurotic form, Horney believed that people came to

expect these elements, creating what she called the

neurotic claims. When simple desires or needs become

claims, individual feel they have a right to those things, they feel they are entitled. They fully expect to be
satised in every way, and they also expect, indeed feel they are entitled, to never be criticized, doubted, or
questioned (Horney, 1950). These claims are not only made on other people, but also on institutions, such as
the workplace or society as a whole. The individual becomes highly egocentric, reminding others of a spoiled
child, and they expect their needs to be satised without putting forth any eort of their own. Obviously, it
is highly unlikely that such a person's needs are going to be fullled, creating a diuse state of frustration
and discontent, so all-encompassing that Horney suggested it can actually be viewed as a character trait in
the neurotic individual. From the therapist's point of view, neurotic claims are particularly serious because
they take the place of the patient's actual personality growth.

In other words, the patient believes that

merely wanting or intending to change is enough, and no eort is necessary. Indeed, the claims themselves
are the neurotic's guarantee of future glory (Horney, 1950).
While these neurotic claims and the feelings of entitlement that accompany them may seem to be just
a personal problem, the fact is that many people make seriously awed self-assessments of their abilities,
attributes, and future behavior. Indeed, the average person typically rates themselves as above average
in many areas of their lives. These awed self-assessments come into play in many aspects of our lives, and
can easily aect others (Dunning, Heath, & Suls, 2004; Williams, 2004). For example, the United States
spends more of its gross domestic product on health care than any other major industrialized country, and
yet many people seriously underestimate the consequences of a wide range of unhealthy behaviors, such as
smoking, drinking alcohol, overeating to the point of obesity, and avoiding exercise. The poor physical health
of many Americans has become a regular topic in the mainstream media, as it threatens both individual
lives (and, consequently, the family and friends of those who die) and our ability to fund healthcare for
those who are poor or aged. In education, students dramatically overestimate the extent to which they have
learned, limiting the likelihood that they will take fuller advantage of their education.

And in business,

the consequences can be severe for many employees, and therefore their families, when a President or CEO
is so over-condent that they make poor decisions that bankrupt the company. As suggested above, these
problems are common, not just conned to those who are neurotic. Thus, the problem of overcondence,
whether the result of an unreasonable trend in society to ensure everyone's self-esteem or the result of neurotic
claims, as well as the extent to which individuals are able to know themselves and, therefore, function in the
real world, is critical to everyone (Dunning, Heath, & Suls, 2004; Williams, 2004).
Whereas the neurotic claims are directed outward, the individual then turns their attention back into
the self. They begin to tell themselves (though this may unconscious) to forget about the worthless creature

should. In order to match up with the idealized image,
should be able to endure any misfortune, they should be
the perfect friend and lover, they should like everyone, they should never feel hurt, they should never be

tyranny of the should. Since it is virtually impossible for anyone to maintain

such discipline in their life, rather than developing real self-condence, the neurotic individual develops a
questionable alternative:

neurotic pride. However, the pride is not in who the individual is, but rather in

who the individual believes they should be (Horney, 1950).

aware of their failure to live up to the idealized self, they develop self-hate and self-contempt. According to
Horney, the battle lines are now drawn between the pride system and the real self. It is not the real self that
is hated, however, but the emerging constructive forces of the real self (the actual aim of psychotherapy!).
This conict, between the pride system and the constructive forces for change inherent in the real self, are so
profound, that Horney named it the

central inner conict! In her earlier writings, Horney used the term

CHAPTER 6. KAREN HORNEY AND ERICH FROMM

neurotic conict to refer to conicts between incompatible compulsive drives. The central inner conict is
unique, in that it sets up a conict between a neurotic drive (the pride system) and a healthy drive (the
trend toward self-realization). Horney believed that individuals who have arrived at this psychological state
of aairs were indeed in a dicult situation:
Surveying self-hate and its ravaging force, we cannot help but see in it a great tragedy, perhaps the greatest
tragedy of the human mind. Man in reaching out for the Innite and Absolute also starts destroying himself.
When he makes a pact with the devil, who promises him glory, he has to go to hell - to the hell within
himself. (pg. 154; Horney, 1950).

Discussion Question: Horney dened the central inner conict as the battle between the constructive
forces for change inherent in the real self and the self-hate that arises out of the pride system. Have you ever
found yourself giving up on something important because you feel incapable, unworthy, or overly self-critical?
If you have ever been aware of these feelings at the time they occurred, what, if anything, did you do about
them?

Horney's Challenge for Psychoanalysis
One of the actions that made Horney most controversial was her willingness to challenge how psychoanalysis should be conducted with patients. In

New Ways in Psychoanalysis

(Horney, 1939), Horney made

it very clear why she thought that psychoanalysis needed to be questioned:
My desire to make a critical re-evaluation of psychoanalytical theories had its origin in a dissatisfaction
with therapeutic results. (pg. 7; Horney, 1939)
Simply put, she had asked many leading psychoanalysts questions about problems in treating her patients,
and none of them could oer meaningful answers (at least, they had no meaning for Horney). In addition, a
few of them, such as Wilhelm Reich, encouraged her to question orthodox psychoanalytic theory. As always,
Horney did not see this as a rejection of Freud. Indeed, she felt that as she pursued new ideas, she found
stronger reasons to admire the foundation that Freud had established.

More importantly, she was upset

that those who criticized psychoanalysis often simply ignored it, rather than looking more deeply into the
valuable insights she believed it still had to oer for any therapist. As before, she saved her most serious
critiques for the study of feminine psychology, though she still considered psychoanalysis with an emphasis
on culture to be a valid therapeutic approach:
The American woman is dierent from the German woman; both are dierent from certain Pueblo Indian
women. The New York society woman is dierent from the farmer's wife in Idaho. The way specic cultural
conditions engender specic qualities and faculties, in women as in men - this is what we may hope to
understand. (pg. 119; Horney, 1939)
In her second book on therapy, Horney proposed something quite radical: the possibility of
(Horney, 1942). She considered

Self-Analysis

self-analysis important for two main reasons. First, psychoanalysis was

an important means of personal development, though not the only means. In this assertion, she was both
emphasizing the value of psychoanalysis for many people, while at the same time saying that it wasn't

so

important that it had to conducted in the orthodox manner by an extensively trained psychoanalyst, since
there are many paths to self-development (e.g., good friends and a meaningful career).

Second, even if

many people sought traditional psychoanalysis, there simply aren't enough psychoanalysts to go around.
So, Horney provided a book to help those willing to pursue their own self-analysis, even if they do so only
occasionally (which she believed could be quite eective for specic issues). She did not suggest that selfanalysis was by any means easy, but more important was the realization that it was possible. With regard to
the possible criticism that self-analysts might not nish the job, that they might not delve into the darkest
and most repressed areas of their psyche, she simply suggested that no analysis is ever complete.

What

matters more than being successful is the desire to continue (Horney, 1942).
When the Association for the Advancement of Psychoanalysis was established, an important part of their
mission was community education. One of the courses was entitled

Are You Considering Psychoanalysis?

This course was so popular, that the instructors decided to publish a book by the same name, and Horney
was chosen the editor-in-chief (Horney, 1946). The chapters present very practical topics, such as:

Your Doubts About Psychoanalysis? (Kelman,
and How Does Analysis Help? (Ivimey, 1946).

1946);

psychoanalysis to cure a person's problems, Horney entitled the nal chapter, which she wrote herself:

How Do You Progress After Analysis?

She begins the chapter by addressing the concern that many of her

patients had: why would a person need more progress after psychoanalysis? Isn't psychoanalysis supposed
to resolve all of a person's psychological problems? As noted above, however, Horney felt that no analysis
is ever complete. But this time the reasoning is not based on questioning the eectiveness of psychoanalysis
itself. Rather, it is based on the potential for human growth, a potential that is boundless:
Your growth as a human being, however, is a process that can and should go on as long as you
live. . .analytical therapy merely sets this process in motion. . . (pg. 236; Horney, 1946)

Discussion Question: Have you ever tried self-analysis, in either a formal or an informal way? If yes,
were your eorts based on any personal experience or knowledge, and did it prove to be helpful?

Brief Biography of Erich Fromm
Erich Fromm was a colleague and long-time friend of Horney. He became interested in psychoanalysis
at the beginning of World War I, when he was amazed at how readily so many people seemed eager for
war. Unlike most other psychoanalysts, however, he earned a Ph.D., not an M.D. This eventually proved
to be a source of conict between Fromm and Horney, as she believed that lay-analysts should not be
allowed to conduct therapy.

Still, Fromm acknowledged Horney as inuencing his career and sharing his

own interests in culture and particularly in society itself (Evans, 1981a). Fromm also considered himself as
remaining especially true to the theories of Sigmund Freud, though some authors consider him to be more
of a philosopher than a psychologist (Evans, 1981a; Lundin, 1979; see also Funk, 1982, 2000).
Fromm was born on March 23, 1900, the only son of Orthodox Jewish parents, in Frankfurt, Germany.
He studied the Talmud and law, but eventually switched from the University of Frankfurt to the University
of Heidelberg and changed his major to sociology and economics. In 1922 he received his doctorate, and in
1924 he was psychoanalyzed by Frieda Reichmann. He turned away from Orthodox Judaism, married Frieda
Reichmann (whom he later divorced), and became active in the Berlin psychoanalytic community (where
he completed his psychoanalytic training). In 1933, Horney invited Fromm to guest lecture in Chicago. A
year later, he moved to New York. There he collaborated with Horney, Harry Stack Sullivan (whom he also
acknowledged as a signicance inuence on his thinking; see, e.g., Evans, 1981a and Fromm, 1941, 1955a),
and Clara Thompson. In 1940 he became a United States citizen, then in 1941 he published

Freedom

Escape from

(Fromm, 1941) and began teaching at the New School (Funk, 1982, 2000).

After his break with Horney (both personally and professionally), Fromm married his second wife and
spent some time teaching at Yale University. A few years later his wife died, Fromm soon married for the
third time, and that marriage lasted until his death.

Shortly after his third marriage, Fromm moved to

Mexico City, Mexico, where he lived for the next 24 years. He joined the medical faculty at the National
Autonomous University of Mexico, and co-founded a Mexican psychoanalytic society. In 1956, he published
his acclaimed book

The Art of Loving (Fromm, 1956). He taught a seminar with D. T.

He also conducted important cross-cultural studies in a Mexican peasant village, resulting in the

publication of

Social Character in a Mexican Village

(Fromm & Maccoby, 1970),

In 1966, Fromm suered a heart attack and began spending more time back in Europe. In 1974, he sold
his home in Mexico and settled permanently in Switzerland (where he had been spending his summers).
After a series of three more heart attacks, Fromm died in 1980 (Funk, 1982, 2000).

Placing Fromm in Context: Individuality in Relation to Society
Erich Fromm was a colleague and close personal friend of Karen Horney for many years. He shared her
interest in the role of culture in personality, and was even more interested in the interactions between the
individual and society as a whole.

Fromm viewed societies as forces that lead to alienation from a more

natural, primitive way of life. As a result, freedom and individuality actually create psychological problems,
as we become disconnected from our immediate social groups (such as the family or local community). This
often leads to unfortunate consequences, such as seeking fellowship within a society at the expense of one's
regard for self and others, providing a framework within which dictatorships can develop (as individuals
completely surrender their freedom).
Fromm examined and combined many dierent interests in his career, including philosophy, economics,

and psychology, and he felt that such a combination of interests was essential for the study of psychology to
have real meaning. In one of the longest projects of his life, he and a number of colleagues applied a unique
form of psychoanalysis to an entire village in rural Mexico. He then described how an understanding of social
character can lead to an understanding of individual character, providing guidance for future considerations
on planning social development during times of dramatic socioeconomic change.

Our Relationship to Society
Fromm was a prolic writer, whose interests included psychoanalysis, economics, religion, ethics, culture,

Sigmund Freud's Mission
Greatness and Limitations of Freud's Thought (Fromm, 1980). His religious works
include such provocative titles as The Dogma of Christ (Fromm, 1955b) and You Shall Be as Gods (Fromm,
1966). He addressed the person's place within society in books such as The Sane Society (1955a) and
The Revolution of Hope (1968). And a collection of his works on gender psychology, Love, Sexuality, and
Matriarchy, was edited by Rainer Funk (1977). The unifying theme throughout Fromm's writings is each
person's relationship to society, which he addressed most directly in Escape from Freedom (Fromm, 1941).
and societal systems. He evaluated both Freud the man and Freud's theories in

(Fromm, 1978) and

Fromm interpreted Freud's theories on the satisfaction of drives as necessarily involving other people,
but for Freud those relationships are only a means to an end.

Although hunger, thirst, and sex may be

common needs, Fromm suggested that the needs that lead to dierences in people's character, such as love
and hatred, lusting for power or yearning to submit, or the enjoyment of sensuous pleasure as well as the
fear of it, are all the result of social processes. One's very nature is a product of the interaction between
the individual and their cultural setting.

We are the creation and achievement of human history, and at

the same time we inuence the course of that history and culture.

In modern times, particularly in the

Western world, our pursuit of individuality has alienated us from others, from the very social structure that
is inherent to our nature. Consequently, our

freedom has become a psychological problem, it has isolated

us from the connections necessary for our survival and development (Fromm, 1941). The danger with this
situation, according to Fromm, is that when an entire society is suering from feelings of isolation and
disconnection with the natural order (from nature itself, in Fromm's view), the members of that society may
seek connection with a societal structure that destroys their freedom and, thus, integrates their self into
the whole (albeit in a dysfunctional way).

The three ways in which individuals escape from freedom are

authoritarianism, or giving oneself up to some authority in order to gain the strength that the individual
lacks, destructiveness, in which the individual tries to destroy the object causing anxiety (e.g., society),
and automaton conformity, in which the person renounces their individual integrity. Fromm believed that
these phenomena provided an explanation for the development of dictatorships, such as the rise of Fascism
in Europe during the 1920s and 1930s. For the leaders of these societies, these processes are such a deeply
ingrained aspect of their character that Fromm actually described Adolf Hitler's destructiveness as evidence
of a necrophilous character (a necrophiliac is someone sexually attracted to the dead; Fromm, 1973).
In order to approach a solution for this problem, Fromm pursued an overall integration of the person and
society. He believed that psychology cannot be divorced from philosophy, sociology, economics, or ethics. The
moral problem facing people in the modern world is their indierence to themselves. Although democracy
and individuality seem to oer freedom, it is only a promise of freedom. When our insecurities and anxieties
lead us to submit to some source of power, be it a political party, church, club, whatever, we surrender our
personal power (Fromm, 1947). Consequently, we become subject to the undue inuence of others (and in
extreme situations, to a Hitler or a Stalin). The solution may be as simple as love, but Fromm suggests that
love is by no means an easy task, and it is not simply a relationship between two people:

. . .love

is not a sentiment which can be easily indulged in by anyone, regardless of the level of maturity

reached by him. It [Fromm's book] wants to convince the reader that all his attempts for love are bound to
fail, unless he tries most actively to develop his total personality, so as to achieve a productive orientation;
that satisfaction in individual love cannot be attained without the capacity to love one's neighbor, without
true humility, courage, faith and discipline. (pg. xxi; Fromm, 1956)
An individual's capacity for love is a reection of the extent to which their culture encourages the
development of the capacity for love as part of the character of each person. Capitalist societies, according
to Fromm, emphasize individual freedom and economic relations. Thus, a capitalist society values economic

143

gain (amassed wealth) over labor (the power of people). And yet, such an economy needs large groups of
people working together (the labor force). As individuals become anxious in their pursuit of life, they become
psychologically invested in the capitalist system, they surrender themselves to capitalism, and become the
labor force that leads to the wealth of those who own the company. Fromm believed this alienated us from
ourselves, from others, and from nature (or, the natural order). In order to regain our connection to others
in a healthy way, we need to practice the art of love, love both for ourselves and for others.

Doing so

requires discipline, concentration, and patience, personal strengths that are all taught in the practice of Zen.
Indeed, Fromm recommends one of Horney's favorite books:

Zen in the Art of Archery

(Herrigel, 1953). We

will examine the relationship between Zen and the approaches of Horney and Fromm to solving society's
problems in more detail in Personality Theory in Real Life. But rst, Fromm chose to examine whether the
principles of psychoanalysis could be used to examine the relationship between individuals and society. He
and his colleagues addressed this question in a Mexican village, a study we will examine in the next section.

Discussion Question: Fromm believed that the freedom we have in modern, Western societies actually
separates and alienates us from others, becoming a source of great anxiety. Can you agree that freedom can
become a problem? Can you agree that people within an entire society could become so anxious that they
support the rise of a dictator?

Fromm's Cross-Cultural Studies in Mexico
Fromm believed that in addition to individual's having a certain character structure, there is also social
character. Social character is common to groups or classes within a society, and provides a framework
within which psychic energy in general is transformed into the specic psychic energy of each person within
the group. From 1957 to 1963, Fromm, Michael Maccoby, and numerous colleagues interviewed every adult
member of a Mexican village, and about half the children, with a focus on applying psychodynamic theory
in order to understand the social character of the village and its role in determining the personality of each
person. The village was chosen as representative of many small villages (this village had approximately 800
residents) in Mexico that underwent substantial changes in socioeconomic structure following the Mexican
revolution. The primary, and most controversial, purpose of this study was to determine whether a society
could be psychoanalyzed in order to understand the character of individual's within that society. Fromm
& Maccoby also hoped that their study would provide information to help predict and plan social change
during times of dramatic socioeconomic change, such as the transition from a non-democratic to a democratic
society (Fromm & Maccoby, 1970).
While it took an entire book for Fromm and Maccoby to report their results, a few key ndings can
be summarized.

First, although they began their study with a questionnaire that had been developed

for a previous study, the level of interpretation needed for psychoanalytic theorizing required additional
information. This was obtained by also having the participants take the Rorschach inkblot test. Second, the
theory of social character, as an adaptation to the socioeconomic conditions of a society that serve to stabilize
and maintain that society, was conrmed.

Of particular interest were those individuals whose character

was typically viewed as deviant, because they seek change and opportunity. When external socioeconomic
conditions force changes upon a society, the previously deviant individuals are among those who ourish
under this new opportunity for change. In other words, their so-called deviance now becomes advantageous,
and they lead others toward new adaptive changes in social character (though this may occur slowly for
most members of the society). In a manner similar to natural selection in evolution, Fromm and Maccoby
referred to this type of change in a society as

social selection. Unfortunately, if the individuals leading

these changes are dysfunctional or cruel individuals, such as the leaders of the fascist groups in Europe
during the 1920s and 1930s, the consequences can be tragic. It was for this very reason that Fromm sought
to understand how people are drawn into groups following their alienation and anxiety due to changes in the
course of society.

Personality Theory in Real Life: Feminine Psychology, Zen Mindfulness,
Psychoanalysis, and Everyday Relationships
The ancient practice of mindfulness, which is associated with Buddhism but also has roots in other
spiritual practices and religions, has become an important and fairly common psychotherapeutic technique
(see, e.g., Germer, Siegel, & Fulton, 2005; Richards & Bergin, 2000; Sperry & Shafranske, 2005). There are

also some interesting connections between the practice of Buddhist mindfulness and those who established
feminine psychology. At the end of her life, Karen Horney went to Japan to study Zen Buddhism with the
renowned Buddhist scholar D. T. Suzuki, and Janet Surrey, one of the founding members of the Stone Center
(which will be introduced in the next chapter), has been practicing mindfulness and working to synthesize
Buddhist practices with relational-cultural approaches to psychology for over 20 years (Surrey, 2005). Surrey
is also on the faculty of the Institute for Meditation and Psychotherapy, and teaches seminars on the use
of mindfulness in conjunction with relational-cultural therapy (and I can personally attest to the wonderful
job she does).
Since Horney became interested in Zen near the end of her life, she wrote very little about it. Indeed,
most of what is recorded is in the book

Final Lectures

(Ingram, 1987), which was published by Douglas

Ingram many years after Horney died. However, her close friend and colleague Erich Fromm also worked
with Suzuki. Fromm mentions Yoga and Buddhism often in his books, and Suzuki and Fromm (along with
another colleague) co-authored

Zen Buddhism & Psychoanalysis

in 1960.

Horney equated Zen mindfulness with living fully in each moment, with wholehearted concentration
(Horney, 1945, 1950; Ingram, 1987). This general theme is expressed quite eloquently in one of Horney's
favorite books,

of Zen

Zen in the Art of Archery

(Herrigel, 1960).

(Herrigel, 1953), as well as in Herrigel's other book,

The Method

In the latter book, Herrigel expresses the essence of Zen from his perspective,

presenting a psychological view that ts well with the relational-cultural perspective we will examine in the

Zen Buddhist is far from limiting his feelings of joy and compassion to human beings and to

every aspect of human existence.

He embraces in these feelings everything that lives and breathes. . .The

Zen Buddhist is constantly conrmed in his experience that there is a fundamental communication which
embraces all forms of existence. . .He does not pass by the joys and suerings of others without taking them
to himself and reinforcing them with his own feelings. . . (pp. 119-120; Herrigel, 1960)
Fromm knew Suzuki at the same time as Horney, but the two men really got to know each other when
Suzuki spent a week in Mexico in 1956, and Fromm then visited Suzuki in New York. In 1964, Fromm wrote
to Suzuki that every morning he read a passage on Zen or something by Meister Eckhart (a well-known
Christian mystic).

In addition, Fromm was interested in Kabbalah and Susm, as well as other spiritual

approaches to understanding people (Funk, 2000). Fromm examined many of these diverse perspective in
books such as

The Nature of Man

(Fromm & Xirau, 1968) and

Psychoanalysis and Religion

(Fromm, 1950),

and he drew interesting connections between the physical activities of Yoga and Wilhelm Reich's somatic
psychology (Fromm, 1992). He was by no means an unqualied supporter, however, suggesting that some
self-proclaimed gurus can do more harm than good when seeking to serve their own selsh interests (usually
in order to make money; Fromm, 1994).
In their work together, Suzuki provided a brief overview of the essentials of Zen practice, which focuses
on living life:
Zen may occasionally appear too enigmatic, cryptic, and full of contradictions, but it is after all a simple
discipline and teaching:
To do goods,
To avoid evils,
To purify one's own heart:
This is the Buddha-Way.
Is this not applicable to all human situations, modern as well as ancient, Western as well as Eastern?
(pg. 76; Suzuki, Fromm, & DeMartino, 1960)
Fromm, for his part, identied ways in which Zen principles appeared to be compatible with psychoanalysis. He considered psychoanalysis to be the Western parallel to Zen, since Zen arose from Indian rationality
and abstraction mixed with Chinese concreteness and realism, whereas psychoanalysis arose from Western
humanism and rationalism. Fromm described the Western world as suering from a spiritual crisis, resulting
from a change in the pursuit of the perfection of humanity to the pursuit of the perfection of things (e.g.,
technology). Since we have lost our connection to nature, and to ourselves and our communities, we have
become anxious and depressed. Psychoanalysis was developed to help us deal with these anxieties, as an

alternative to the awed ways in which we had been dealing with them in the past: religion (according to
Freud). As described very simply in the quote above, Zen Buddhism also seeks to resolve human anxiety,
simply by doing good and avoiding evil. In Freudian terms, doing good results from knowing oneself, and
one can only know oneself through the process of psychoanalysis. Then, a person can act in accordance with
reality, rather than being inuenced by unconscious, repressed, and dysfunctional psychological processes.
Therefore, Fromm considered the essential nature of psychoanalysis to be compatible with Zen (Suzuki,
Fromm, & DeMartino, 1960), a perspective supported more recently by Mark Epstein in his comparison of
Buddhist meditation and psychoanalysis,

Thoughts Without a Thinker

(Epstein, 1995).

Fitting even more closely with Fromm's perspective on human development and psychoanalysis, Zen
art is intimately involved with nature, and with humanity's relationship with nature (Herrigel, 1953, 1960;
Suzuki, Fromm, & DeMartino, 1960). Fromm used Zen perspectives to reform his views on psychoanalysis
and development. He considered the development of the individual to be a re-enactment of the development
of the species (i.e., ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny). Prior to birth there is no anxiety, following birth we
must deal with anxiety. We can try to deal with our anxieties by regressing to our earliest state, or we can
attempt to complete the process of birth, which Fromm described as a lifelong process:
Birth is not one act; it is a process. The aim of life is to be fully born, though its tragedy is that most of
us die before we are thus born. To live is to be born every minute. (pg. 88; Suzuki, Fromm, & DeMartino,
1960)
Fromm does not suggest that this is easy, but it is possible. However, which method is to be preferred:
psychoanalysis or the practice of Zen Buddhism? That would appear to be a personal matter, since both
psychoanalysis and Zen Buddhism aim toward the same goal:
This description of Zen's aim could be applied without change as a description of what psychoanalysis
aspires to achieve; insight into one's own nature, the achievement of freedom, happiness and love, liberation
of energy, salvation from being insane or crippled. . .The aim of Zen transcends the goal of ethical behavior,
and so does psychoanalysis. It might be said that both systems assume that the achievement of their aim
brings with it an ethical transformation, the overcoming of greed and the capacity for love and compassion.
(pp. 122-123; Suzuki, Fromm, & DeMartino, 1960)
Just as love is considered an essential element of being Christian, compassion is essential to Buddhism.
In

The Art of Loving,

Fromm (1956) noted that a person cannot love themselves if they do not love others.

Thus, love and compassion are intertwined, one must love and care for all people, indeed for all things,
to be fullled.

Zen teaches this peace in many ways, even sword ghting and archery become art when

performed by a Zen master. Fromm acknowledged that a Zen master of sword ghting has no wish to kill
and experiences no hate for his opponent.

Although a classic psychoanalyst might insist that the sword

master is motivated by some unconscious hatred or anger, Fromm says that such a psychoanalyst simply
does not grasp the spirit of Zen. Likewise, citing Herrigel's

Zen in the Art of Archery

again, Fromm notes

how archery has been transformed from a military skill into an exercise of spirituality, or in non-spiritual
terms, a form of

playful

violence (as opposed to aggressive violence; Fromm, 1964, 1973).

Thus, the practice of mindfulness, the art of love, compassion, all play similar roles in helping people to
be aware of who they are and of their relationships with others. In addition, they encourage and support
a genuine desire to be connected to others, and to maintain healthy interpersonal connections, even in such
diverse activities as eating breakfast, going to work, or practicing archery.

6.1 Review of Key Points
•

Horney was the rst psychodynamic theorist to challenge Freud's perspective on the psychology of
women.

•

Horney did not deny that girls envy boys for certain anatomical advantages that boys have, but she
suggested that another dynamic force comes into play: female genital anxiety.

•

In addition to female genital anxiety, an important consequence of the castration complex in women
is the experience of wounded womanhood.

CHAPTER 6. KAREN HORNEY AND ERICH FROMM

•

Because girls are repeatedly made to feel inferior to boys, and few outlets are available for their creative
drives, many women develop a masculinity complex. This complex is manifested by a desire for revenge
against men and the rejection of feminine traits.

•

Horney suggested that boys are actually more envious of girls, since boys place such a minimal role in
pregnancy, childbirth, and nurturing an infant. Indeed, they may feel so inadequate that they seek to
conquer many women in relationships, but avoid any long-term or meaningful relationships.

•

As the result of cultural pressure, Horney felt that many women overvalue love, and experience a
desperate need to be with a man.

•

Horney eventually moved away from studying feminine psychology, considering it more of a cultural
issue than a gender issue. She believed that demeaning women also hurt children and men, and she
did not want to further the conict between men and women.

•

Horney believed that all children are born with an anxiety related to survival.

When they are not

nurtured and cared for fully, they then develop a basic anxiety toward the seemingly unsafe world.

•

Basic anxiety leads to basic hostility, and the child must then choose some strategy for dealing with
other people. The three basic strategies are moving toward people, moving against people, and moving
away from people.

•

As the neurotic personality progresses, due to the continued failure to resolve one's conicts, an idealized
image is formed. In addition, the neurotic individual externalizes their anxiety.

•

Horney suggested that the real self contains an innate trend toward self-realization. However, in the
neurotic individual, this energy is turned toward realizing the idealized image.

•

The neurotic individual then embarks on a search for glory, which includes neurotic claims.

The

neurotic claims then lead to a powerful compulsion known as the tyranny of the should.

•

As this dysfunctional state continues, neurotic pride leads to self-hate, the two phenomena being
opposite sides of the pride system.

This conict between the real self and the pride system is the

central inner conict.

•

Horney felt that psychoanalysis needed to be re-evaluated because in many cases it was ineective.
Her most radical suggestion involved the possibility of teaching people about self-analysis.

•

Fromm believed that the freedom associated with modern societies had alienated us from the natural
order. Consequently, freedom had become a psychological problem, resulting in alienation and anxiety.

•

Individuals who feel anxious and alienated seek connection by any means, according Fromm, including
submitting themselves to authoritarian regimes.

•

Fromm encouraged practicing the art of love, or a deep concern for others, as a way to feel connected
without surrendering one's personal freedom.

•

In his extensive study of a Mexican village, Fromm believed that psychodynamic principles could be
used to study the social character of groups. He also felt that the evolution of groups, or societies, over
time reects a type of social selection.

•

Both Horney and Fromm believed that Zen Buddhism and psychoanalysis shared common elements,
and that each discipline could benet from studying the other. They attempted to incorporate these
ideas in ways that might enhance interpersonal relationships in our everyday lives.

Psychology of Women

Although Karen Horney was the rst female psychoanalyst to openly challenge Sigmund Freud's theories
regarding the psychology of women, she abandoned this line of work when she came to the conclusion that
culture was a more signicant issue than gender in determining the psychology of women. Of course, that
decision is based on separating gender from culture, which is not something that everyone would agree with.
In the 1970s, the Stone Center was established, as a group of pioneering women began the work that led to
a theory on the personality development and psychology of women based on a combination of seeking and
forming relationships within a cultural context. This work continues today, and the theory is being expanded
to include the personality development of all people, women and men.
However, not all female theorists have separated themselves so clearly from Freud's basic theories. One
of those women holds a special place in the history of psychology, since she was instrumental in helping
both Sigmund and Anna Freud escape Austria as the Nazi regime came to power.

Her name was Marie

Bonaparte. Bonaparte was a princess, a great-grandniece of Emperor Napoleon I of France, a patient and
student of Sigmund Freud, and in 1953 she wrote

Female Sexuality

women closely followed a traditional Freudian view.

(Bonaparte, 1953). Her perspective on

In contrast, Nancy Chodorow's feminist perspective

has signicantly separated her perspective on the psychology women from that of Freud. Still, Chodorow
has worked to combine feminist and psychoanalytic perspectives, in a manner similar to the object relations
theories put forth by the Neo-Freudians, and she has focused on the unique female experience of mothering.
We will begin this chapter by examining the work of Princess Bonaparte, as an example of a female
theorist who remained true to Freud's own theories.

Then, we will examine the alternative presented by

the members of the Stone Center group. Finally, this chapter will conclude with a brief look at Chodorow's
eorts to combine the psychoanalytic and feminist perspectives.

7.1 Feminine Psychology in the Freudian Tradition
Although Sigmund Freud believed that female psychology was the result of an incomplete and frustrated
male development, he also acknowledged that he did not fully understand the psychology of women.
particularly interesting passage can be found in his

A

New Introductory Lectures on Psycho-Analysis :

One might consider characterizing femininity psychologically as giving preference to passive aims. This
is not, of course, the same thing as passivity; to achieve a passive aim may call for a large amount of
activity...we must beware in this of underestimating the inuence of social customs, which similarly force
women into passive situations. All this is still far from being cleared up. . . (pgs. 143-144; Freud, 1933/1965)
So, Freud did suggest the possibility that cultural factors (social customs) play a role in the development of girls and women. Furthermore, he acknowledged that there was much more to learn about these
developmental processes. Freud ended his lecture on femininity with the following:

CHAPTER 7. PSYCHOLOGY OF WOMEN

148

That is all I had to say to you about femininity. It is certainly incomplete and fragmentary and does not
always sound friendly. But do not forget that I have only been describing women in so far as their nature is
determined by their sexual function. It is true that that inuence extends very far; but we do not overlook
the fact that an individual woman may be a human being in other respects as well. If you want to know
more about femininity, enquire from your own experiences of life, or turn to the poets, or wait until science
can give you deeper and more coherent information. (pg. 167; Freud 1933/1965)
Published in 1933, this was one of the last times Freud wrote about femininity and the psychology of
women. Always the scientist, Freud suggested that future research will provide a better understanding of this
topic. The Stone Center group, whose work we will encounter shortly, is perhaps the most complete eort
made toward fullling Freud's expectations. First, however, let's consider the interesting work of Princess
Marie Bonaparte, as one of the female psychodynamic theorists who adhered closely to Freud's perspective.

Princess Marie Bonaparte
Marie Bonaparte (1882-1962), Her Royal Highness Princess George of Greece, was a patient, student,
and dear friend of Sigmund Freud. She was the great-grandniece of Napoleon Bonaparte, Emperor of France,
and she married Prince George of Greece in 1907. As a wealthy aristocrat, she was able to help both Freud
himself and the nancially struggling International Psychoanalytic Publishing House (known more commonly
as the

Verlag, from its name in German).

It was Marie Bonaparte who paid a ransom to the Nazis in Austria

in order to secure Freud's release as World War II approached.

Earlier, she had used her wealth to help

support the Verlag, which Freud had established to provide a means for publishing a variety of works on
psychoanalysis (Gay, 1998; Jones, 1957). However, Bonaparte was far more than just a wealthy colleague.
Bonaparte shared Freud's interest in antiquities, and often helped him nd the best pieces for his collection
(M. Freud, 1983). She also loved dogs, particularly Chows, and Freud came to love that breed as well. As
Freud, his wife Martha, and their daughter Anna waited to escape Austria in 1938, Freud and Anna spent
some of their time translating books and articles into German.

One of those books was entitled

Topsy,

written by Bonaparte about her favorite dog (M. Freud, 1983; Jones, 1957). But it was not just a simple
matter of waiting to leave Austria. In a particularly poignant story, Martin Freud described the time when
his sister Anna was arrested by the Gestapo. Bonaparte was with her, and demanded to be arrested as well.
However, at that point in time the Nazis were still intimidated by members of the royal houses of Europe,
and Anna Freud was taken alone.

She was released later, but Freud is said to have paced all day in his

house worrying about her (M. Freud, 1983). When the Freud family nally left Austria for England, only
Bonaparte was able to safely transfer their gold out of the country. She did so by sending the gold to the
king of Greece, who then sent it to the Greek embassy in London (Jones, 1957). Thus, Freud and his family
were nancially secure upon reaching London, and Freud was able to repay the ransom that Bonaparte had
paid for his release.
Bonaparte also served the eld of psychoanalysis in an important way other than her own work. Early
in Freud's career, during the time when he underwent his own psychoanalysis, he had a very close friend
named Wilhelm Fliess. So close were these friends, and at such a critical time in Freud's career, that their
correspondence contained a great many intimate details.

In addition to personal correspondence, Freud

sent many scientic notes about his theory to Fliess. When Fliess died in 1931, his widow asked Freud to
return the letters Fliess had written to Freud. However, Freud had destroyed all of them years earlier, and he
wanted her to do the same to his letters. However, she chose to sell the letters to a bookseller. The bookseller
then sold them to Bonaparte. When Bonaparte told Freud that she had them, he insisted that she destroy
them. She refused, however, and those letters eventually became available to the elds of psychology and
psychiatry (Gay, 1998; Jones, 1953).
As Bonaparte became involved in psychoanalysis professionally, Freud both admired and supported her
work (Gay, 1998; Jones, 1957). In a letter to Bonaparte after Freud had reviewed her paper on psychoanalysis
and time, Freud wrote The work does you honor. (cited in Jones, 1957). She was also active in establishing
the growing eld as a whole.

She had helped to establish a psychoanalytic society in France, and Freud

later nominated her to be vice-president of the International Psychoanalytic Association. In nominating her,
Freud considered her a worthy candidate:

. . .not

only because one can show her o to the outside world, but because she is a person of high

intelligence, of masculine capacity for work, has done ne papers, is wholly devoted to the cause, and, as is
well known, also in a position to lend material aid. She has now become 50 years old, will probably turn
away increasingly from her private interests and steep herself in analytic work. I need not mention that she
alone keeps the Fr[ench] group together. (pg. 586; cited in Gay, 1998).

Female Sexuality
Bonaparte rst met Freud as a patient seeking help with her

frigidity. The psychoanalysis does not

appear to have been successful, but the experience did provide Bonaparte with a new goal in life (Gay,
1998). Given the nature of her own problems, it should not be surprising that her writings on psychoanalysis
focused on sexuality.

Female Sexuality

is a wide-ranging book that draws heavily on Freud's work, but

also relies on the works of Horney and Klein.

In addition, she mentions Adler in a somewhat favorable

light, though she concludes that both Freud and Adler failed to fully understand female sexuality (as they
themselves acknowledged). Still, she bases most of her work on a paper of the same title written by Freud
in 1931, although she attempts to describe the development of girls and women more thoroughly and with
more consideration given to potential alternatives.
Bonaparte began by describing three types of women. The so-called true women are those who have
succeeded in substituting the desire for a penis (penis envy) with a desire to have children (particularly a
son); their sexuality is normal, vaginal, and maternal. They are known as acceptives. The second type, the
renouncers, gives up all competition with men, fail to seek external love objects, and live largely unfullled
lives. The claimers, however, deny reality and cling to both psychical and organic male elements present
in all women. While it may appear to us today that the claimers are asserting themselves as being proud
to be female, Bonaparte considered this position to cause an inability to adapt to one's erotic function. As
Freud had described, in order for a girl to develop, she must transfer both her love object (from mother to
father) and her erotogenic zone (from clitoris to vagina).

According to Bonaparte, claimers who will not

transfer their love object will become lesbians, those who do not transfer their erotogenic zone will never
achieve fully satisfying sexual relationships as adults. In other words, they will be frigid. Evidence of the
psychical nature of the problem of frigidity can be seen in the responsiveness of patients to psychoanalysis.
Patients who are totally frigid, those who experience no pleasure in sexual activity, often respond well to
psychoanalysis. However, women who are partially frigid, those who have more specically not transferred
their erotogenic zone from the clitoris to the vagina, tend to be very resistant to psychoanalysis. According
to Bonaparte, partial frigidity is much more common than total frigidity. Partial frigidity is also much more
common than men realize, since many women hide this reality by pretending to enjoy sexual activity.
In agreement with Freud, Bonaparte considers boys and girls to begin their sexual lives equally, in an
oral erotic stage focused on the mother's breast.

As they transition into the anal stage, there are the

beginnings of a contrast between active and passive forces: the expulsion of feces vs. the retention of feces.
The important activity of toilet training begins in this stage, and so social conditioning is also coming into
play. Although Bonaparte, like Freud, continued to emphasize biological factors in sexual development, the
acknowledgement that sociocultural factors related to toilet training come into play lays the foundation for
girls being pushed toward the passive role that strict Freudians believe they must play.
In the transition from the anal stage to the phallic stage, the interplay between active and passive forces
that were present during the anal stage takes a dierent direction in boys and girls. Very simply, since the
boys penis actively protrudes, and his love object can continue to be his mother (or, later, other women
as substitutes), the boy will develop an active relationship with the world around him.

Girls, however,

ultimately need to transfer their sexuality from the clitoris (which had been related to a small penis until
this point) to the vagina, a passive organ with regard to sexuality. Girls must also transfer their love object
to their father (or, later, to other men), and accept the physical penetration that is required for sexual
intercourse. In this manner, according to Freud, Bonaparte, and others, boys grow into aggressive men and
girls grow into passive women. Provided, of course, that women accept their role.
Adding to the complexity of this process for girls, who need to transfer the libidinal cathexes from both
the clitoris and the love object of mother, is the consequence of when the girl rst experiences an orgasm.
Since this potentially can occur at any time during the dynamic processes of transferring these libidinal
cathexes, the rst orgasm can have a variety of either positive or negative eects.

For boys it is simply

CHAPTER 7. PSYCHOLOGY OF WOMEN

150

easier, since the penis is the one obvious source of sexual pleasure, and the boy never has to transfer his love
object away from women (though it should transfer from the mother to another woman). This dierence in
sexual development is summed up by Bonaparte:
It is on these diverse superimposed courses that the edice of female sexuality rises.

Constitutional

factors are its foundation, and life builds thereon. Finally, we see the feminine psychosexual structure in its
main varieties, varieties more multiform even than those to which male sexuality is susceptible, centered as
it is on the phallus, that highly dierentiated organ developed to serve the male erotic function. (pg. 140;
Bonaparte, 1953)
As an interesting side note, Bonaparte also discussed some of the research that had been done up to that
point in time on female circumcision/mutilation, particularly in primitive cultures. She speculated on how
psychoanalytic theories of sexuality might apply to those practices, and how societies today might compare
to primitive cultures that have retained such practices. Can we really say that things have changed since
Bonaparte wrote the following passage?
It would appear that humans, living in communities, cannot dispense with sexual repression of some kind
and that, if it has not succeeded in coming from within, it must go on coming from without.

(pg.

157;

Bonaparte, 1953)
Before we turn our attention to the Stone Center group, I would like to mention something that may
have already entered your mind. This book is about personality, not sexuality. While it may be true that
sexuality is an important part of life, it is certainly not the same thing as one's personality. Unless, of course,
you happen to be a strict Freudian theorist, as was Bonaparte. She does tend to equate the psychology of
women with their sexuality. The psychologists of the Stone Center group, however, have moved beyond this
biased view of the psychology of women.

Discussion Question: In keeping with Freud's original theory, Bonaparte believed that sexual development is much more dicult for girls than it is boys. Do you agree with that, and if you do, what is it that
makes things so much more dicult for girls? Are there any unique challenges that only boys face?

Placing the Psychology of Women in Context: Sexism vs. Feminism
Sigmund Freud developed a theory of female sexuality that helped to explain his observation that most
people in psychoanalysis were women.

Karen Horney agreed that women suer more than men, but she

placed the blame on men, and the patriarchal culture that maintains special privileges for men only. Despite
the fact that Freud and Adler admitted that they did not fully understand women, and that there were
many women among the neo-Freudians, it was a long time before a unique perspective on the psychology of
women developed.
In contrast to women like Princess Bonaparte and Helene Deutsch, the rst leading female member of the
Vienna Psychoanalytic Society (the very rst female member, Hermine von Hug-Hellmuth, was murdered
in 1924; Deutsch, 1973, Sayers, 1991) and the rst person to devote an entire book to the psychology of
women (a two volume set published in consecutive years; Deutsch, 1944, 1945), Jean Baker Miller and her
colleagues at the Stone Center developed a unique theory on the psychological development and personality
of women. Although their theory, based on personal relationships and culture, developed in part as a result
of increasing interest in feminist studies in the 1960s and 1970s, the work that continues today strives to
include the personality development of all people (women and men).
There are some women, however, who believe that a feminist perspective can be combined more readily
with Freud's basic ideas (see, e.g., Mitchell, 2000). Nancy Chodorow has worked to combine both psychodynamic and feminist ideas into a comprehensive theory. Although the result is basically an object relations
theory, Chodorow's work has been reserved for this chapter due to her inclusion of the feminist side of the
perspective.
It is also important to note that the work of the Stone Center group and Nancy Chodorow is much more
contemporary than that of Bonaparte, Deutsch, and many of the neo-Freudians discussed in this book (most
of whom are no longer alive). Thus, the development of feminist perspectives on the psychology of women
continues today.

of womb envy as a powerful counterpart to penis envy, theories on the psychology of women remained framed
within a psychodynamic perspective. Until, that is, the 1970s, when Jean Baker Miller and a group of women
colleagues created a revolution in our potential understanding of the psychology of women.

Jean Baker Miller and the Stone Center Group
In 1974, Wellesley College in Massachusetts established the Center for Research on Women, and in
1981, the Stone Center for Developmental Services and Studies was established. Working in collaboration
as the Wellesley Centers for Women (WCW), the Center for Research on Women conducts a variety of
interdisciplinary studies on matters related to gender equity, while the Stone Center focuses on psychological well-being and a comprehensive understanding of human development, particularly the psychological development of women.

A wide range of information on the WCW can be found on their website

(http://www.wcwonline.org).
Jean Baker Miller (1927-present) was a practicing psychoanalyst who had already written one book on the
psychoanalysis of women when she published

Toward a New Psychology of Women (Miller, 1976).

This book

has been credited with nothing less than changing the very way in which we study the psychology of women.
Since the earliest work of Sigmund Freud, women were seen as inferior, and so-called feminine attributes
(e.g., vulnerability, weakness, emotionality, helping others; see Miller, 1976) were seen as psychologically
weak. Miller and her colleagues at the Stone Center have worked hard to change that perspective. Typically

Women's Growth in Connection
Women's Growth in Diversity (Jordan, 1997b), and The

working in collaboration, publishing collections of writing in books such as
(Jordan, Kaplan, Miller, Stiver, & Surrey, 1991),

Complexity of Connection

(Jordan, Walker, & Hartling, 2004), they developed a relational model of human

development that focuses on

connections, disconnections, mutuality, and empathy. Examples of how

relationships can be damaged when one person seeks connection but the other person seeks to disconnect
are all around us. Miller presented an example from a patient she identied as Doris. Doris was trying to
share with her husband how upset she was after a day of nding it very dicult to deal with her colleagues
at work:
He listened for about ten minutes. That's about his limit. Then he said, Aw, don't let the bastards
upset you. That's just the sort of thing I suspect. It sounds ne and even supportive. But it really means,
Shut up. I've heard enough. (pg. 100; Miller, 1976)
More recently, as members of the Stone Center became increasingly aware of the role of culture in development, the relational model evolved into the

relational-cultural theory (RCT)of human development

(Jordan & Walker, 2004). The inclusion of culture in the theory should not be underestimated or taken for
granted. Psychological theories are not immune from the bias inherent in societies that seek to maintain
their hierarchical power structures. Western societies are highly individualistic, and when individuality is
favored in our theories the result can be unfortunate:
In a culture that valorizes separation and autonomy, persons with cultural privilege can falsely appear
more self-sucient and so will be judged as healthier, more mature, more worthy of the privilege the society
aords. Those who enjoy less cultural privilege (whether by virtue of race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or
economic status) will more likely be viewed as decient and needy. They are more likely to be subject to
systematic disadvantage and culture shaming. (pgs. 4-5; Jordan & Walker, 2004)

Relational-Cultural Theory
Miller established the foundation of RCT by addressing two fundamental dierences in status and power
that are part of human life: the dierences between children and adults, and the dierences between boys/men
and girls/women. Children lack the privileges of adulthood, but this is temporary, and it is the role of parents
and other adults (e.g., teachers) to help children grow up. In most modern cultures, women have typically
lacked the privileges of men, and to a large extent that continues today. Since male/female dierences are
permanent, cultural phenomena usually develop in which men seek to maintain their power and status over
women. This is the reason why psychology, a eld traditionally dominated by men, has equated feminine
attributes with psychological pathology (Miller, 1976).

Curiously, not only men participate in this bias.

Anna Freud did not challenge her father's views on girls and women, Melanie Klein claimed to be closer to
Freud's point of view than even his daughter was, and Marie Bonaparte believed that women who do not
accept the role dened for them by men would never be able to experience sexual satisfaction.

uncommon for a subordinate group to participate in this adaptive role, according to Miller, and as a result
women may have gained their greatest advantage: the responsibility, and with it the privilege, of the intense
emotional connection necessary to raise a child (Miller, 1976).
Considering the primary object relation necessary for a child to grow and thrive, the relationship between
a mother and her infant, a relationship in which the mother serves the child rst, many feminine attributes
take on new meaning. Vulnerability, weakness, helplessness, emotionality, participating in the development
of others, cooperation, and creativity are all essential to giving oneself over to others, which is necessary to
care for a baby, while at the same time allowing that baby to develop its own sense of mastery over the world
and its own sense of individuality. Should it be surprising that women want to relate to other adults in the
same way? According to Miller, one of the greatest diculties men face in relationships with women is that
men actually want to reclaim those very same elements of personality that men have delegated to women,
and that gave rise to the woman's dened role in society.

In accomplishing this task, as women advance

their own place within society, men will have to adapt their coping strategies (Miller, 1976).
Now let us consider the essential elements of RCT. In RCT, the concept of object relations is viewed
in light of connections vs. disconnections. People seek connections: family, friends, clubs, church groups,
neighbors, the list goes on. Very few people live in isolation, and fewer still want it that way. But this raises
a question about the meaning of the word self. If a woman's experience is based on connections, do women
develop a sense of self, and what is the nature of that self ? Miller (1991) suggests that we don't get caught
up in technicalities regarding the words we use to dene this construct, but simply accept an open-minded
denition of self. It appears to her that boys do develop a more clearly delineated sense of self, whereas girls
may develop a more encompassing sense of self. Women do talk more about relationships, but not because
they want or need to be either dependent or independent. Women simply want to be in relationships with
others, to be connected. Looking more closely at the meaning of being dependent in a relationship, Stiver
(1991) suggests that women often adopt a role of apparent dependence in relationships with men in order
to connect with them in a manner acceptable to the man's gender role perspective. It does not appear to
her that women are any more dependent in relationships than men, but when they do seek connection they
do so by whatever means necessary. So when it is necessary for forming connections, Stiver considers to
depend on another as part of an interpersonal dynamic:
I would like to dene dependency as: A process of counting on other people to provide help in coping
physically and emotionally with the experiences and tasks encountered in the world when one has not
sucient skill, condence, energy, and/or time. I have dened it as a process to stress that it is not static
but changes with opportunities, circumstances, and inner struggles. (pg. 160; Stiver, 1991)
Making successful connections involves two other important processes: mutuality and empathy. These
closely related constructs come into play in meaningful relationships. Mutuality refers to both participants
(or more, as the case may be) in a relationship being fully engaged in the connection.

Each person is

interested in and aware of the other, they are willing and able to share their thoughts, feelings, and needs,
they do not manipulate each other, they value the connection, and they are open to change. Perhaps most
importantly, they also experience empathy with other persons (Jordan, 1991a).

Empathy, according to

Jordan (1991b), is an understanding of that aspect of the self that involves we-ness, transcendence of the
separate, disconnected self. Jordan acknowledges a connection between her views and those of Kohut, who
considered empathy an essential aspect of the mirroring that helps an infant to rst see itself through the
eyes of another as it plays with its mother (see also Mitchell & Black, 1995; Strozier, 2001). Empathy is a
complex cognitive and emotional process necessary for a sense of separateness within connection, and selfempathy is an important therapeutic construct (Jordan, 1991b). Interactions of such intimacy are not new
to object relations theory, but are usually only considered in the context of the earliest relationship between
mother and child.

RCT considers mutuality and empathy as essential attributes of connections made by

adults, particularly connections made by women. An often overlooked consideration is that mutuality and
empathy need to be taught and learned. For example, Winnicott's good enough mother does not simply
appear when a child is born (Surrey, 1991).

of, and how important to you is that membership? Do you, or people you know, consider the groups they
belong to as more important than themselves?

Figure 7.1

According to relational-cultural theory (RCT), women seek connections in their lives, and support each
other with mutuality and empathy. These attributes have helped women in their role as the primary
caregivers for our children. However, as a cultural theory, RCT suggests that these so-called feminine
attributes are the result of gender roles, not some inherent dierence between males and females.
The source of most suering in life, according to RCT, is disconnection.

An acute disconnection can

This may be followed by negative emotions,

such as sadness, anger, or depression. There may be a heightened sense of self-consciousness and relational
awareness may slow down, we may even become immobilized (Jordan, 2004). After repeated disconnections
we may become fearful of turning to others for help and support, even when we need it most. This has been
referred to as the

central paradox of connection/disconnection. When we hurt someone we love, or
strategies of

are hurt by someone we love, the conict often leads to withdrawal and the development of

disconnection. As a consequence of this ongoing process, although we all share a desire to connect with
others, those who have been hurt by loved ones believe that they can connect with others only if they hold
back part of themselves when they try to connect. Within the context of RCT, this desire for connection,
while holding back from it, is also known as the

central relational paradox (Miller et al., 2004).

This may very well be a signicant factor in the fact that so many marriages end in divorce. Marriage is
probably the most signicant connection that adults in Western cultures choose to make, and so divorce would
also be the most signicant disconnection. There is certainly no easy answer for the high divorce rate, but an
interesting possibility has been suggested by Harville Hendrix, who specializes in marital therapy. Hendrix
(1988) believes that we choose a mate based on the unconscious recognition of characteristics they have in
common with our parents, and that we hope through marriage to solve the psychological and emotional

CHAPTER 7. PSYCHOLOGY OF WOMEN

damage we suered as children. In other words, we think we are connecting with our spouse, but we really
want to reconnect with our parents. Unfortunately, this creates a false connection, a connection that cannot
easily be resolved, especially given the apparently dierent communication styles of men and women (Gray,
1997, 1999, 2002, 2004; Vincent, 2006).
So how do we resolve problems of disconnection? Relational therapy is based on the idea that a therapist
can provide a relationship in which the patient can experience connection, mutuality, and empathy. In looking
at the therapeutic approaches of people like Sigmund Freud, Winnicott, and Kohut, Judith Jordan (1997a)
argues that the actual engagement in the therapeutic relationship is aloof and disconnected. She feels that an
obvious and overlooked aspect of therapy is that the more engaged the therapist is the more one enhances the
self, the other, and the relationship. Consequently, the therapeutic relationship can enhance one's capacity
to be more whole, real, and integrated in other relationships as well.

This relational perspective, which

provides the basis for relational therapy, is based on three principles:
1. That people grow in, through, and toward relationships.
2. For women in particular, connection with others is central to psychological
well-being.
3. Movement toward relational mutuality can occur throughout life, through
mutual empathy, responsiveness, and contribution to the growth of each
individual and to the relationship. (Jordan, 1997a)
Once again we see the importance of empathy.

Empathy involves more than just sharing the other

person's feelings, it stresses the capacity to feel into the other person's experience (Jordan, 1997a; Mitchell
& Black, 1995).

Kohut emphasized the importance of empathy, as did the humanistic psychologist Carl

Rogers. In contrast to empathy, the emphasis that has existed in therapy on the autonomous self as the
real self  can result in the creation of pathologically isolated individuals, individuals who feel self-sucient,
but who are really disconnected from others. Relational therapy does not focus on the self, but rather on
relationships.

To accomplish this goal, the therapist must be willing to respond to their patients in an

authentic manner (Miller, Jordan, Stiver, Walker, Surrey, & Eldridge, 2004). If the therapist can convey to
the patient that they are moved, the patient will be moved, knowing that her/his thoughts and feelings have
reached another person, they do matter, and they can be part of a mutual experience. This is connection,
and appears to be the key source of change in relational therapy (Miller et al., 2004).

Discussion Question: Relational therapy focuses on providing an environment for the patient to experience connection, empathy, and mutuality. It requires an engaged therapist. What are your ideas about
how therapy should be conducted?

Connections Across Cultures: Janet Surrey and
Eastern Perspectives on Human Relations
Janet Surrey is one of the founding members of the Stone Center group, and for over 20 years she
has been working to synthesize Buddhist mindfulness with relational-cultural theory and relational therapy.
Most people think of mindfulness meditation as a solitary activity, but at its core is a desire to connect with
the universal spirit that we all share. So, from the latter perspective, mindfulness meditation fosters a deep
connection with others. Connecting with others is also at the core of relational therapy (with disconnection
seen as the primary cause of suering in life). Thus, the practice of mindfulness meditation can enhance the
connections sought in relational therapy, and relational therapy can enhance one's attention to the present
moment in both relational therapy and in one's everyday relationships.
Of particular value for the therapist, the practice of mindfulness meditation can deepen one's empathic
skills. According to Surrey, during a mindfulness-informed therapy session the skilled therapist is attentive
to their own sensations, feelings, thoughts, and memories as the patient is describing the same psychological
phenomena. This helps the therapist to both experience the patient and attend to the ow of the relationship.
Thus, the therapist can be fully aware of the shifting qualities of the connections and disconnections within the
therapeutic relationship. Although therapists typically rely on verbal interaction, the practice of mindfulness
oers a unique opportunity to experience a conscious silence. Just such a rare opportunity for silence in one's
busy life can be created in the genuine connection that results from a healthy and meaningful relationship
(Surrey, 2005).

Surrey is by no means alone in drawing connections between Buddhist mindfulness and either the value of
relationships or relational forms of therapy. His Holiness the Dalai Lama has emphasized that human beings
cannot live in isolation, our very nature is that we are social animals. Our communities, indeed our entire
society, require us to live cooperatively. This cooperation is best accomplished through love and compassion.
It is not enough, however, to care only for those who care for us. When we harbor negative emotions toward
those whom we do not like, those negative emotions harm ourselves.

Thus, the Dalai Lama considers it

essential to cultivate equanimity, the ability to care for everyone equally, no matter whom they may be
(Dalai Lama, 2001, 2002). Likewise, the widely respected Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh (nominated for
a Nobel Peace Prize by Martin Luther King, Jr.) stresses the importance of practicing mindfulness within
a supportive group, and then extending the compassion that arises to all others (Thich Nhat Hanh, 1995,
1999).
Within the eld of psychology, the well-known therapist/authors Jon Kabat-Zinn, who developed the

Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction

program, and Steven Hayes, the founder of , have emphasized the

importance of relationships with other people and the world around us, as well as how mindfulness can help
to enhance those relationships (Hayes, 2004; Hayes et al., 1999; Kabat-Zinn, 1990). In addition, personal
relationships appear to be particularly important for a variety of groups in American society, including:
African Americans (Belgrave & Allison, 2006; Cook & Wiley, 2000; Taylor et al., 2004), Native Americans
(Axelson, 1999; Trujillo, 2000), aged individuals (Belsky, 1999; Hillier & Barrow, 1999), and those who are
dying (Kubler-Ross, 1969, 1983). Indeed, the ability to form and maintain healthy relationships has been
identied as a vitally important human strength and an important aspect of well-being (Berscheid, 2003;
Cantor, 2003; Cloninger, 2004; Sears, 2003). Thus, by examining cross-cultural factors that aid in developing
and maintaining healthy relationships and, therefore, a healthy personality, we can continue to move toward
a psychology that benets us all.

Nancy Chodorow's Psychoanalytic Feminism and the Role of Mothering
In 1974, Juliet Mitchell suggested that Freudian psychoanalysis oered an important means for understanding the psychology of women, and that feminism should embrace Freud's theoretical perspective. She
did not suggest that Freud was necessarily right about the psychological development of women, but she did
emphasize the importance of object relations theory and the interactions between mothers, their children,
and families as a whole (Mitchell, 2000). Some 50 years earlier, Helene Deutsch had suggested that women
do not seek to become mothers due to penis envy, but rather they want to replace passive femininity with an
active role as a woman and mother (Deutsch was analyzed and trained by Sigmund Freud himself; Deutsch,
1944, 1945, 1973, Sayers, 1991). Deutsch (1973) wrote that she had great admiration for Marie Bonaparte as
a person and a scholar (Deutsch knew Bonaparte personally), but Deutsch found little of interest in Bonaparte's strict application of Freudian theory to the psychology of women. The person best known today for
attempting to combine elements of Freud's theory with an objective perspective on a psychology of women is
Nancy Chodorow (1944-present), a sociologist and psychoanalyst who has focused on the special relationship
between mothers and daughters.
In 1978, Chodorow published

The Reproduction of Mothering.

Twenty years later, she wrote a new

preface for the second edition, in which she had the advantage of looking back at both the success of her
book and the criticism that it drew from some. Chodorow acknowledged that many feminists felt obliged to
choose between a biologically-based psychology of women and mothering (the essential Freudian perspective)
versus a view in which the psychology of women and their feelings about mothering were determined by social
structure and cultural mandate. Chodorow believed that social structure and culture were important, but
she insisted nonetheless that the biological dierences between males and females could not be dismissed.
Indeed, they lead to an essential dierence in the mother-daughter relationship as compared to the motherson relationship (Chodorow, 1999a).
According to Chodorow, when a woman becomes a mother, the most important aspect of her relationship
with any daughter is the recognition that they are alike.
someday.

Thus, her daughter can also become a mother

This special connection is felt by the daughter and incorporated into her psyche, or ego.

It is

important to remember that much of this is happening at an unconscious level. It is not as if women choose
to favor their daughters over their sons, and it is not as if women reject their sons. Chodorow argues that it

CHAPTER 7. PSYCHOLOGY OF WOMEN

156

just simply happens, because of the biological similarity between females. As a consequence of this special
relationship, daughters are subtly shaped in ways that lead to what we often think of as feminine attributes:
a sense of

self-in-relation, feeling connected to others, being able to empathize, and being embedded in or

dependent on relationships. For Chodorow, the internalization of the mother-daughter relationship, from the
daughter's point of view, is the development of a most important object relation. As adults, many women
feel a desire to have children, which is often described as a maternal instinct or a biological drive (the feeling
that their biological clock is ticking). As an alternative, Chodorow suggests that these feelings have instead
been shaped by the unconscious fantasies and emotions associated with the woman's internal relationship to
her own mother (Chodorow, 1999a).
In contrast to the development of daughters, Chodorow suggests that sons are inuenced by the essential
feelings of dierence conveyed by their mother.

Consequently, and in contrast to women, men grow up

asserting their independence, and they will be anxious about intimacy if it signals dependence on another.
In addition, within the cultural framework of society, men develop a greater concern with being masculine
than women are concerned with their femininity (Chodorow, 1999a).
The cultural dierences between men and women, as well as the early childhood dierences in their
relationships with their parents, create problems for the typical family structure. Since men tend to avoid
relationships, they are unlikely to fulll the relational needs that women have. In addition, young girls most
likely experience their relationship with their father within the context of their relationship with their mother,
whereas young boys have a more direct two-person relationship with their mother (in terms of heterosexual
relationships; Chodorow, 1999a).

Therefore, in order for a woman to balance the relational triangle she

experienced with her mother and father, and the subsequent intrapsychic object-relational structure she
developed, she needs to have a child. In other words, by having children, women can reimpose intrapsychic
relational structure on the social world, and they can relate to the father of their child in terms of a family
structure they were familiar with in childhood. Furthermore, having a child recreates the intimacy a woman
shared with her own mother.
One critique of

The Reproduction of Mothering

that Chodorow agreed with was her emphasis on a uni-

versal mother-daughter experience, within a heterosexual nuclear family. In her later writings, Chodorow
emphasized individual subjectivity, still in relation to others, but also within a wider range of family structures and individual situations (Chodorow, 1989, 1994, 1999b). She felt that a balance between the principles
of psychoanalysis and an understanding of culture was the best overall approach:
A psychoanalysis that begins with the immediacy of unconscious fantasy and feeling found in the clinical
encounter illuminates our understanding of individual subjectivity and potentially transforms all sociocultural thought. . .At the same time, feminist, anthropological, and other cultural theories require that psychoanalysts take seriously the ways in which cultural meanings intertwine with and help to constitute psychic
life. (pg. 274; Chodorow, 1999b)

Personality Theory in Real Life: The Experience of Mothering
When Helene Deutsch wrote the rst books devoted entirely to the psychology of women, the second
volume was devoted entirely to

Motherhood

(Deutsch, 1945).

She described motherhood as providing a

wonderful opportunity to directly experience a sense of immortality. She distinguished, however, between

motherhood and motherliness. Motherhood, according to Deutsch, refers to the relationship between
mother and child, which varies from individual to individual and from culture to culture. When Deutsch
wrote of motherliness, she referred to both a quality of character that pervades a woman's whole personality
and emotional phenomena related to a child's helplessness and need for care. In a motherly woman, one's
own need for love is transferred from the ego to the child, and this maternal love has the chief characteristic
of

tenderness (Deutsch, 1945). Of course, no two women experience motherhood in exactly the same way.

Deutsch recognized two primary types of mothers. The rst type is the woman whose world is opened to a
new reality by the birth of a child. She feels no loss, and she develops her own personality fully only after
having a child. The second type of mother feels restricted and impoverished by her children. Such women,
according to Deutsch, have spent their emotionality on other pursuits (such as sexuality, or a career), and
they lack sucient libido to withstand the emotional burden of children:

in her existence, give a personal color to each woman's motherliness. (pg. 55; Deutsch, 1945)
Deutsch had several miscarriages in the early years of her marriage, causing her a great deal of anxiety
during the pregnancy that nally gave her a son named Martin.

In her autobiography, she speaks both

fondly and proudly of her only child, as well as of the wonderful relationship he shared with his father. With
regard to being a busy, working woman during her son's childhood, Deutsch wrote that this could only be
worked out on individual basis, and with some necessary compromise (Deutsch, 1973).
Although fathers play a role in parenting, only a woman can really understand what it's like to be a
mother. Two entertaining books written by mothers about their relationships with their children are

or just hang out and have a crab-fest. It's a healthy dose of friendship that fuels us to ght another day.
(pg. 189; Syler, 2007)
But what happens when a woman is not a good mother? Christine Lawson has studied the mothering
abilities of women who suer from borderline personality disorder. In

Understanding the Borderline Mother

(2000), Lawson has identied four types of borderline mother: the waif (characterized by helplessness and
hopelessness), the hermit (characterized by perfectionism and worrying), the queen (characterized by demanding attention and feelings of emptiness), and the witch (characterized by a desire for power and the
very real threat of being physically abusive). The tragic challenge for the children of borderline mothers,
according to Lawson, is that our mother is the rst thing any of must understand in our lives, and our
survival depends on understanding her. Although borderline personality is highly resistant to treatment in
therapy, as with any personality disorder, therapy can help women with borderline personality disorder to
avoid passing on the condition to their children.
While it is understandable that mothering would be dicult for women suering from psychological
disorders, it also appears to be true that no such thing as a maternal instinct exists. Anthropologist Sarah
Hrdy, who has been elected to both the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and
Sciences, has studied infanticide in dierent cultures and other primate species. She found it quite surprising
that some mothers (human, ape, and monkey) will contribute to the death of their own child (or children),
and in some cases then mate with the male that killed them.
Hrdy in a rather lengthy book entitled

Mother Nature

While this is a complex issue, covered by

(Hrdy, 1999), she raises some profound questions. For

example, if women instinctively love their children, why do so many women directly or indirectly contribute
to their deaths? Since fathers contribute equally to the genetic makeup of the child, why haven't fathers
evolved a greater interest in and commitment to caring for their children? And perhaps most interestingly,
just why did these little creatures evolve to be so plump, engaging, and utterly adorable? (Hrdy, 1999).
Consider your own mother and your relationship with her. Do you consider her to have been a goodenough mother? Whether you are a man or a woman, how has your relationship with your mother aected
your relationships with others (especially if you have children)?

Discussion Question: Chodorow proposed that women desire to have children in order to recreate the
intimacy they had with their mother when they were a baby, and to balance their relationship with their
husband in a manner similar to how they rst experienced their father. Does this suggestion seem reasonable,
or do you think there may be a more fundamental biological drive toward bearing ospring?

sexually.

•

Bonaparte suggested that psychological development in boys is easier than it is for girls, since all
children begin by loving a women (their mother), which is appropriate for boys. She also believed the
physical structure of the penis made understanding sexuality easier for boys.

•

Jean Baker Miller began addressing the dierences in power and status that exist between boys/men
and girls/women, and the cultural system that develop to maintain those dierences.

•

Since a woman must make major sacrices to raise an infant, Miller believed that so-called feminine
attributes are essential to accomplish that goal.

•

According to Miller, and other theorists at the Stone Center, a woman's experience is based on connections with others. This led to the formation of relational-cultural theory.

•
•

Empathy and mutuality are essential to forming successful connections.
Problems arise when people become disconnected. Repeated disconnection can make individuals afraid
to form connections, resulting in the central paradox of connection/disconnection.

•

Relational therapy seeks to provide an opportunity for patients to experience empathy, mutuality, and
connection. It requires therapists to become fully engaged in the therapeutic process.

•

According to Chodorow, the mother-daughter relationship is special because the mother experiences
her daughter(s) as similar to herself. The daughter incorporates this special relationship as a primary
object relation.

•

A woman's development of the special object relation regarding her mother leads to a need to balance
her relational world by becoming a mother herself.

•

Chodorow believed that since mothers experience their sons as dierent, boys begin to develop as more
independent individuals.

Carl Rogers and Abraham Maslow

In contrast to both the often dark, subconscious emphasis of the psychodynamic theorists and the somewhat
cold, calculated perspectives of behavioral/cognitive theorists, the humanistic psychologists focus on each
individual's potential for personal growth and self-actualization.

Carl Rogers was inuenced by strong

religious experiences (both in America and in China) and his early clinical career in a children's hospital.
Consequently, he developed his therapeutic techniques and the accompanying theory in accordance with
a positive and hopeful perspective.

Rogers also focused on the unique characteristics and viewpoint of

individuals.
Abraham Maslow is best known for his extensive studies on the most salient feature of the humanistic
perspective: self-actualization. He is also the one who referred to humanistic psychology as the third force,
after the psychodynamic and behavioral/cognitive perspectives, and he specically addressed the need for
psychology to move beyond its study of unhealthy individuals. He was also interested in the psychology of
the work place, and his recognition in the business eld has perhaps made him the most famous psychologist.
Henry Murray was an enigmatic gure, who seemingly failed to properly acknowledge the woman who
inspired much of his work, and who believed his life had been something of a failure. Perhaps he felt remorse
as a result of maintaining an extramarital aair with the aforementioned woman, thanks in large part to
the advice and help of Carl Jung! Murray extended a primarily psychodynamic perspective to the study of
human needs in normal individuals. His Thematic Apperception Test was one of the rst psychological tests
applied outside of a therapeutic setting, and it provided the basis for studying the need for achievement
(something akin to a learned form of self-actualization).

Carl Rogers and Humanistic Psychology
Carl Rogers is the psychologist many people associate rst with humanistic psychology, but he did
not establish the eld in the way that Freud established psychoanalysis. A few years older than Abraham
Maslow, and having moved into clinical practice more directly, Rogers felt a need to develop a new theoretical
perspective that t with his clinical observations and personal beliefs. Thus, he was proposing a humanistic
approach to psychology and, more specically, psychotherapy before Maslow. It was Maslow, however, who
used the term humanistic psychology as a direct contrast to behaviorism and psychoanalysis. And it was
Maslow who contacted some friends, in 1954, in order to begin meetings that led to the creation of the
American Association for Humanistic Psychology.

Rogers was included in that group, but so were Erich

Fromm and Karen Horney, both of whom had distinctly humanistic elements in their own theories, elements
that shared a common connection to Alfred Adler's Individual Psychology (Stagner, 1988). In addition, the
spiritual aspects of humanistic psychology, such as peak experiences and transcendence, have roots in the
work of Carl Jung and William James, and go even further back in time to ancient philosophies of Yoga and
Buddhism.
In at least one important way, Rogers' career was similar to that of Sigmund Freud.

As he began

his clinical career, he found that the techniques he had been taught were not very eective. So, he began

experimenting with his own ideas, and developing his own therapeutic approach. As that approach developed,
so did a unique theory of personality that aimed at explaining the eectiveness of the therapy. Rogers found
it dicult to explain what he had learned, but he felt quite passionately about it:

. . .the

real meaning of a word can never be expressed in words, because the real meaning would be the

thing itself. If one wishes to give such a real meaning he should put his hand over his mouth and

point.

This

is what I should most like to do. I would willingly throw away all the words of this manuscript if I could,
somehow, eectively

point

to the experience which is therapy. It is a process, a thing-in-itself, an experience,

a relationship, a dynamic. . . (pp. ix; Rogers, 1951)

Brief Biography of Carl Rogers
Carl Ransom Rogers was born on January 8, 1902, in Chicago, Illinois. His parents were well-educated,
and his father was a successful civil engineer. His parents loved their six children, of whom Rogers was the
fourth, but they exerted a distinct control over them. They were fundamentalist Christians, who emphasized
a close-knit family and constant, productive work, but approved of little else. The Rogers household expected
standards of behavior appropriate for the `elect' of God: there was no drinking of alcohol, no dancing, no
visits to the theater, no card games, and little social life at all (DeCarvalho, 1991; Thorne, 2003).
Rogers was not the healthiest of children, and his family considered him to be overly sensitive. The more
his family teased him, the more he retreated into a lonely world of fantasy. He sought consolation by reading
books, and he was well above his grade level for reading when he began school. In 1914 the family moved
to a large farm west of Chicago, a move motivated primarily by a desire to keep the children away from the
temptations of suburban city life. The result was even more isolation for Rogers, who lamented that he'd
only had two dates by the end of high school. He continued to learn, however, becoming something of an
expert on the large moths that lived in the area. In addition, his father encouraged the children to develop
their own ventures, and Rogers and his brothers raised a variety of livestock.

Given these interests, and

in keeping with family tradition, Rogers enrolled in the University of Wisconsin-Madison to study scientic
agriculture (DeCarvalho, 1991; Thorne, 2003).
During his rst year of college, Rogers attended a Sunday morning group of students led by Professor
George Humphrey. Professor Humphrey was a facilitative leader, who refused to be conventional and who
encouraged the students to make their own decisions. Rogers found the intellectual freedom very stimulating,
and he also began to make close friends. This increased intellectual and emotional energy led Rogers to reexamine his commitment to Christianity. Given his strong religious faith, he decided to change his major
to history, in anticipation of a career as a Christian minister. He was fortunate to be chosen as one of only
twelve students from America to attend a World Student Christian Federation conference in Peking, China.
He traveled throughout China (also visiting Korea, Hong Kong, Japan, the Philippines, and Hawaii) for 6
months, surrounded by other intelligent and creative young people. He kept a detailed journal, and wrote
lengthy letters to his family and Helen Elliott, a childhood friend whom he considered to be his sweetheart.
His mind was stretched in all directions by this profound cross-cultural experience, and the intellectual
and spiritual freedom he was embracing blinded him to the fact that his fundamentalist family was deeply
disturbed by what he had to say. However, by the time Rogers was aware of his family's disapproval, he
had been changed, and he believed that people of very dierent cultures and faiths can all be sincere and
honest (Kirschenbaum, 1995; Thorne, 2003). As a curious side note, Rogers' roommate on the trip was a
Black seminary professor. Rogers was vaguely aware that it was strange at that time for a Black man and a
White man to room together, but he was particularly surprised at the stares they received from the Chinese
people they met, who had never seen a Black person before (Rogers & Russell, 2002). After his return from
China, Rogers graduated from college, and 2 months later he married Helen. Again his family disapproved,
believing that the young couple should be more established rst. But Rogers had been accepted to the Union
Theological Seminary in New York City, and both he and Helen wanted to be together.

His family may

have wanted them to wait because Union Theological Seminary was, perhaps, the most liberal seminary in
America at the time (DeCarvalho, 1991; Rogers & Russell, 2002; Thorne, 2003).
Rogers spent 2 years at the seminary, including a summer assignment as the pastor of a small church in
Vermont. However, his desire not to impose his own beliefs on others, made it dicult for him to preach.
He began taking courses at nearby Teachers' College of Columbia University, where he learned about clinical

and educational psychology, as well as working with disturbed children. He then transferred to Teachers'
College, and after writing a dissertation in which he developed a test for measuring personality adjustment
in children, he earned his Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology. Then, in 1928, he began working at the Rochester
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (DeCarvalho, 1991; Thorne, 2003).
Rogers was immersed in his work in Rochester for 12 years.

He found that even the most elaborate

theories made little sense when dealing with children who had suered severe psychological damage after
traveling through the courts and the social work systems. So Rogers developed his own approach, and did his
best to help them. Many of his colleagues, including the director, had no particular therapeutic orientation:
When I would try to see what I could do to alter their behavior, sometimes they would refuse to see me the
next time. I'd have a hard time getting them to come from the detention home to my oce, and that would
cause me to think, What is it that I did that oended the child? Well, usually it was overinterpretation, or
getting too smart in analyzing the causes of behavior. . .So we approached every situation with much more
of a question of What can we do to help? rather than What is the mysterious cause of this behavior? or
What theory does the child t into? It was a very good place for learning in that it was easy to be open
to experience, and there was certainly no pressure to t into any particular pattern of thought. (pg. 108;
Rogers & Russell, 2002)
Eventually Rogers wrote a book outlining his work with children,

lem Child

The Clinical Treatment of the Prob-

(Rogers, 1939), which received excellent reviews. He was oered a professorship at Ohio State

University. Beginning as a full professor gave Rogers a great deal of freedom, and he was frequently invited
to give talks. It has been suggested that one such talk, in December 1940, at the University of Minnesota,
entitled Newer Concepts in Psychotherapy, was the ocial birthday of client-centered therapy. Very popular with his students, Rogers was not so welcome amongst his colleagues. Rogers believed that his work
was particularly threatening to those colleagues who believed that only their own expertise could make psychotherapy eective. After only 4 years, during which he published

Counseling and Psychotherapy

(Rogers,

1942), Rogers moved on to the University of Chicago, where he established the counseling center, wrote

Client-Centered Therapy (Rogers, 1951) and contributed several chapters to Psychotherapy and Personality
Change (Rogers & Dymond, 1954), and in 1956 received a Distinguished Scientic Contribution Award from
the American Psychological Association. Then, in 1957, he accepted a joint appointment in psychiatry and
psychology at the University of Wisconsin to study psychotic individuals. Rogers had serious doubts about
leaving Chicago, but felt that the joint appointment would allow him to make a dramatic contribution to
psychotherapy. It was a serious mistake. He did not get along with his colleagues in the psychology department, whom he considered to be antagonistic, outdated, rat-oriented, and distrustful of clinical psychology,
and so he resigned. He kept his appointment in the psychiatry department, however, and in 1961 published
perhaps his most inuential book,

On Becoming a Person

(Rogers, 1961).

In 1963, Rogers moved to California to join the Western Behavioral Sciences Institute, at the invitation
of one of his former students, Richard Farson.

eventually agreed.

This was a non-prot institute dedicated to the study
Rogers was leery of making another major move, but

He became very active in research on encounter groups and educational theory.

Five

years later, when Farson left the institute, there was a change in its direction. Rogers was unhappy with the
changes, so he joined some colleagues in leaving and establishing the Center for Studies of the Person, where
he remained until his death. In his later years, Rogers wrote books on topics such as personal power and
marriage (Rogers, 1972, 1977). In 1980, he published

A Way of Being

(Rogers, 1980), in which he changed

the terminology of his perspective from client-centered to person-centered.

With the assistance of his

daughter Natalie, who had studied with Abraham Maslow, he held many group workshops on life, family,
business, education, and world peace. He traveled to regions where tension and danger were high, including
Poland, Russia, South Africa, and Northern Ireland.

In 1985 he brought together inuential leaders of

seventeen Central American countries for a peace conference in Austria. The day he died, February 4, 1987,
without knowing it, he had just been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize (DeCarvalho, 1991; Kirschenbaum,
1995; Thorne, 2003).

CHAPTER 8. CARL ROGERS AND ABRAHAM MASLOW

162

Raised with a strong Christian faith, exposed to Eastern culture and spirituality in college, and then employed
as a therapist for children, he came to value and respect each person he met. Because of that respect for
the ability of each person to grow, and the belief that we are innately driven toward actualization, Rogers
began the distinctly humanistic approach to psychotherapy that became known as client-centered therapy.
Taken together, client-centered therapy and self-actualization oer a far more positive approach to fostering the growth of each person than most other disciplines in psychology. Unlike the existing approaches
of psychoanalysis, which aimed to uncover problems from the past, or behavior therapies, which aimed to
identify problem behaviors and control or x them, client-centered therapy grew out of Rogers' simple
desire to help his clients move forward in their lives. Indeed, he had been trained as a psychoanalyst, but
Rogers found the techniques unsatisfying, both in their goals and their ability to help the children he was
working with at the time. The seemingly hands-o approach of client-centered therapy t well with a Taoist
perspective, something Rogers had studied, discussed, and debated during his trip to China. In

Rogers (1980) quotes what he says is perhaps his favorite saying, one which sums up many of his

deeper beliefs:
If I keep from meddling with people, they take care of themselves,
If I keep from commanding people, they behave themselves,
If I keep from preaching at people, they improve themselves,
If I keep from imposing on people, they become themselves.

Lao Tsu, c600 B.C.;

Note: This translation diers somewhat from the one

cited in the References. I have included the translation Rogers quoted,
since the dierence likely inuenced his impression of this saying.
Rogers, like Maslow, wanted to see psychology contribute far more to society than merely helping individuals with psychological distress. He extended his sincere desire to help people learn to really communicate,
with empathic understanding, to eorts aimed at bringing peace to the world. On the day he died, he had
just been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. Since a Nobel Prize cannot be awarded to someone who has
died, he was not eligible to be nominated again. If he had lived a few more years, he may well have received
that award. His later years were certainly committed to peace in a way that deserved such recognition.

Basic Concepts
Rogers believed that each of us lives in a constantly changing private world, which he called the experiential eld. Everyone exists at the center of their own experiential eld, and that eld can only be fully
understood from the perspective of the individual. This concept has a number of important implications.
The individual's behavior must be understood as a reaction to their experience and perception of the eld.
They react to it as an organized whole, and it is their reality. The problem this presents for the therapist
is that only the individual can really understand their experiential eld.

This is quite dierent than the

Freudian perspective, in which only the trained and objective psychoanalyst can break through the defense
mechanisms and understand the basis of the patient's unconscious impulses. One's perception of the experiential eld is limited, however. Rogers believed that certain impulses, or sensations, can only enter into the
conscious eld of experience under certain circumstances. Thus, the experiential eld is not a true reality,
but rather an individual's potential reality (Rogers, 1951).
The one basic tendency and striving of the individual is to actualize, maintain, and enhance the ex-

actualizing tendency. Rogers borrowed the term
self-actualization, a term rst used by Kurt Goldstein, to describe this basic striving.

periencing of the individual or, in other words, an

actualization that remains is the maintenance of the existent state.

For the sick, the only form of selfThat, however, is not the tendency

of the normal. . .Under adequate conditions the normal organism seeks further activity. (pp. 162-163; Goldstein, 1934/1995).
For Rogers, self-actualization was a tendency to move forward, toward greater maturity and independence,
or self-responsibility.

This development occurs throughout life, both biologically (the dierentiation of a

fertilized egg into the many organ systems of the body) and psychologically (self-government, self-regulation,
socialization, even to the point of choosing life goals). A key factor in understanding self-actualization is the
experiential eld. A person's needs are dened, as well as limited, by their own potential for experience. Part

of this experiential eld is an individual's emotions, feelings, and attitudes. Therefore, who the individual is,
their actual

self, is critical in determining the nature and course of their self-actualization (Rogers, 1951).

We will examine Maslow's work on self-actualization in more detail below.
What then, is the self ? In Rogers' (1951) initial description of his theory of personality, the experiential
eld is described in four points, the self-actualizing tendency in three points, and the remaining eleven points
attempt to dene the self. First and foremost, the self is a dierentiated portion of the experiential eld. In
other words, the self is that part of our private world that we identify as me, myself, or I. Beyond that,
the self remains somewhat puzzling.

Can the self exist in isolation, outside of relationships that provide

some context for the self ? Must the self be synonymous with the physical body? As Rogers' pointed out,
when our foot goes to sleep from a lack of circulation, we view it as an object, not as a part of our self !
Despite these challenging questions, Rogers tried to dene and describe the self.
Rogers believed the self is formed in relation to others; it is an organized, uid, yet consistent conceptual
pattern of our experiential interactions with the environment and the values attached to those experiences.
These experiences are symbolized and incorporated into the structure of the self, and our behavior is guided
largely by how well new experiences t within that structure.

We may behave in ways inconsistent with

the structure of our self, but when we do we will not own that behavior.

When experiences are so

inconsistent that we cannot symbolize them, or t them into the structure of our self, the potential for
psychological distress arises. On the other hand, when our concept of self is mature enough to incorporate
all of our perceptions and experiences, and we can assimilate those experiences symbolically into our self,
our psychological adjustment will be quite healthy. Individuals who nd it dicult to assimilate new and
dierent experiences, those experiences that threaten the structure of the self, will develop an increasingly
rigid

self-structure. Healthy individuals, in contrast, will assimilate new experiences, their self-structure

will change and continue to grow, and they will become more capable of understanding and accepting others
as individuals (Rogers, 1951).
The ability of individuals to make the choices necessary for actualizing their self-structure and to then
fulll those choices is what Rogers called

personal power (Rogers, 1977). He believed there are many

self-actualized individuals revolutionizing the world by trusting their own power, without feeling a need to
have power over others. They are also willing to foster the latent actualizing tendency in others. We can
easily see the inuence of Alfred Adler here, both in terms of the creative power of the individual and seeking
superiority within a healthy context of social interest.

Client-centered therapy was based on making the

context of personal power a clear strategy in the therapeutic relationship:

. . .the

client-centered approach is a conscious renunciation and avoidance by the therapist of all control

over, or decision-making for, the client. It is the facilitation of self-ownership by the client and the strategies
by which this can be achieved. . .based on the premise that the human being is basically a trustworthy
organism, capable of. . .making constructive choices as to the next steps in life, and acting on those choices.
(pp. 14-15; Rogers, 1977)

Discussion Question: Rogers claimed that no one can really understand your experiential eld. Would
you agree, or do you sometimes nd that close friends or family members seem to understand you better
than you understand yourself ? Are these relationships congruent?

Personality Development
Although Rogers described personality within the therapist-client relationship, the focus of his therapeutic
approach was based on how he believed the person had arrived at a point in their life where they were suering
from psychological distress. Therefore, the same issues apply to personality development as in therapy. A
very important aspect of personality development, according to Rogers, is the parent-child relationship. The
nature of that relationship, and whether it fosters self-actualization or impedes personal growth, determines
the nature of the individual's personality and, consequently, their self-structure and psychological adjustment.
A child begins life with an actualizing tendency. As they experience life, and perceive the world around
them, they may be supported in all things by those who care for them, or they may only be supported
under certain conditions (e.g., if their behavior complies with strict rules).

grow up psychologically healthy and well-adjusted. However, if the parents oer only

regard, if they only support the child according the desires and rules of the parents, the child will develop
conditions of worth. As a result of these conditions of worth, the child will begin to perceive their world
selectively; they will avoid those experiences that do not t with its goal of obtaining positive regard. The
child will begin to live the life of those who set the conditions of worth, rather than living its own life.
As the child grows older, and more aware of its own condition in the world, their behavior will either
t within their own self-structure or not.

If they have received unconditional positive regard, such that

their self-regard and positive regard are closely matched, they will experience

congruence. In other words,

their sense of self and their experiences in life will t together, and the child will be relatively happy and
well-adjusted. But, if their sense of self and their ability to obtain positive regard do not match, the child
will develop

incongruence. Consider, for example, children playing sports. That alone tells us that parents

have established guidelines within which the children are expected to play.

Then we have some children

who are naturally athletic, and other children who are more awkward and/or clumsy. They may become
quite athletic later in life, or not, but during childhood there are many dierent levels of ability as they grow.
If a parent expects their child to be the best player on the team, but the child simply isn't athletic, how
does the parent react? Do they support the child and encourage them to have fun, or do they pressure the
child to perform better and belittle them when they can't? Children are very good at recognizing who the
better athletes are, and they know their place in the hierarchy of athletics, i.e., their athletic self-structure.
So if a parent demands dominance from a child who knows they just aren't that good, the child will develop
incongruence. Rogers believed, quite understandably, that such conditions are threatening to a child, and
will activate defense mechanisms. Over time, however, excessive or sudden and dramatic incongruence can
lead to the breakdown and disorganization of the self-structure.

As a result, the individual is likely to

experience psychological distress that will continue throughout life (Rogers, 1959/1989).

Discussion Question: Conditions of worth are typically rst established in childhood, based on the
relationship between a child and his or her parents. Think about your relationship with your own parents
and, if you have children, think about how you treat them. Are most of the examples that come to mind
unconditional positive regard, or conditional positive regard? How has that aected your relationship with
your parents and/or your own children?

Figure 8.1

Sometimes parents create conditions of worth by overemphasizing the importance of competition. Even
a trip to the pumpkin patch can be a challenge to get the biggest, best pumpkin.
Another way in which Rogers approached the idea of congruence and incongruence was based on an

real self. In addition, there
ideal self, much like the ctional nalism described by Adler or the idealized self-image described

individual's dual concept of self. There is, of course, the actual self-structure, or
is also an

by Horney. Incongruence develops when the real self falls far short of the accomplishment expected of the
ideal self, when experience does not match the expectations of the self-structure (Rogers, 1951, 1959/1989).
Once again, the relationship between parents and their children plays an important role in this development.
If parents expect too much, such as all A's every marking period in school, but the child just isn't academically
talented, or if the parents expect their child to be the football team's quarterback, but the child isn't a good
athlete, then the ideal self will remain out of reach. Perhaps even worse, is when a child is physically or
emotionally abused. Such a child's ideal self may remain at a relatively low standard, but the real self may be
so utterly depressed that incongruence is still the result. An important aspect of therapy will be to provide a
relationship in which a person in this unfortunate condition can experience the unconditional positive regard
necessary to begin reintegrating the self-structure, such that the gap between the real self and the ideal self
can begin to close, allowing the person to experience congruence in their life.
What about individuals who have developed congruence, having received unconditional positive regard
throughout development or having experienced successful client-centered therapy? They become, according
to Rogers (1961), a

fully functioning person. He also said they lead a good life. The good life is a process,

not a state of being, and a direction, not a destination. It requires psychological freedom, and is the natural
consequence of being psychologically free to begin with. Whether or not it develops naturally, thanks to a
healthy and supportive environment in the home, or comes about as a result of successful therapy, there are
certain characteristics of this process. The fully functioning person is increasingly open to new experiences,
they live fully in each moment, and they trust themselves more and more. They become more able and more
willing to experience all of their feelings, they are creative, they trust human nature, and they experience

the richness of life. The fully functioning person is not simply content, or happy, they are

alive :

I believe it will become evident why, for me, adjectives such as happy, contented, blissful, enjoyable,
do not seem quite appropriate to any general description of this process I have called the good life, even
though the person in this process would experience each one of these feelings at appropriate times. But the
adjectives which seem more generally tting are adjectives such as enriching, exciting, rewarding, challenging,
meaningful. This process. . .involves the courage to be.

. . .the

deeply exciting thing about human beings is

that when the individual is inwardly free, he chooses as the good life this process of becoming. (pp. 195-196;
Rogers, 1961)

Discussion Question: Rogers described self-actualized people as fully functioning persons who are
living a good life. Do you know anyone who seems to be a fully functioning person? Are there aspects of
their personality that you aspire to for yourself ? Does it seem dicult to be fully functioning, or does it
seem to make life both easier and more enjoyable?

Connections Across Cultures: Self-Realization as the
Path to Being a Fully Functioning Person
Rogers described an innate drive toward self-actualization, he talked about an ideal self, and he said that
a fully functioning person lived a good life. But what does this actually mean? In the Western world we look
for specic, tangible answers to such questions. We want to know what the self-actualization drive is, we
want to know which ideals, or virtues, are best or right, and we want to dene a good life. All too often, we
dene a good life in terms of money, power, and possessions. The Eastern world has, for thousands of years,
emphasized a very dierent perspective. They believe there is a natural order to life, and it is important
that we let go of our need to explain the universe, and it is especially important that we let go of our need
to own pieces of the universe. In the

Tao Te Ching,

Lao Tsu (c. 600 B.C./1989) writes:

Something mysteriously formed,
Born before heaven and earth.
In the silence and the void,
Standing alone and unchanging,
Ever present and in motion.
Perhaps it is the mother of ten thousand things.
I do not know its name,
Call it Tao.
For lack of a better word, I call it great. . .
The greatest Virtue is to follow Tao and Tao alone. . .
Tao follows what is natural.
At about the same time, some 2,600 years ago, the

Bhagavad Gita

was also written down (Mitchell,

2000). In the second chapter one nds:
When a man gives up all desires
That emerge from the mind, and rests
Contented in the Self by the Self,
He is called a man of rm wisdom. . .
In the night of all beings, the wise man
Sees only the radiance of the Self;
But the sense-world where all beings wake,
For him is as dark as night.
In each of these sacred books, we are taught that there is something deeper than ourselves that permeates
the universe, but it is beyond our comprehension. It is only when we stop attempting to explain it, our way
of trying to control it, and be content to just be ourselves, that we can actually attain that goal. To achieve
this goal seems to require the absence of conditions of worth.

If someone has been given unconditional

positive regard throughout their life, they will be content to live that life as it is. Rogers was well aware of
this challenge, and he described the good life as a process, not something that you could actually get, but
something that you had to Be. Still, is it possible that a fully functioning person might have the insight
necessary to understand the essence of the universe? Not according to Swami Sri Yukteswar:

Available for free at Connexions <http://cnx.org/content/col11901/1.1>

167

Man possesses eternal faith and believes intuitively in the existence of a Substance, of which the objects of
sense - sound, touch, sight, taste, and smell, the component parts of this visible world - are but properties. As
man identies himself with his material body, composed of the aforesaid properties, he is able to comprehend
by these imperfect organs these properties only, and not the Substance to which these properties belong.
The eternal Father, God, the only Substance in the universe, is therefore not comprehensible by man of this
material world, unless he becomes divine by lifting his self above this creation of Darkness or

Maya.

See

Hebrews 11:1 and John 8:28.
Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.
Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the son of man, then shall ye know that I am he.

Jnanavatar Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri, 1894/1990
So whether we believe in God, Tao, an eternal Self, a mortal Self, or merely an actualizing tendency, for
thousands of years there has been the belief, amongst many people, that our lives are about more than just
being alive for a limited period of time. And it is in the recognition and acceptance, indeed the embracing,
of that something more, even if we can't conceive it in our conscious mind, that we nd and live a good life.
When Paramahansa Yogananda, a direct disciple of Swami Yukteswar, came to the United States in 1920 to
establish a permanent Yoga society, it was suggested that he name his society God-Realization. However,
since he believed life is about realizing (or actualizing, in psychological terms) our selves, he established his
organization as the Self-Realization Fellowship (Yogananda, 1946).
Self-realization, in the context of Yoga, refers to becoming aware of one's connection to the spark of
divinity that exists within us, which may well be the source of our actualizing tendency. It is not the same
as the sense of I or me that we normally think of. After all, are we our body or our mind? Consider the
body. Is it the body we were born with, or the body we have now? Is our mind what we are thinking now,
or what we were thinking 2 years ago? Both the body and the mind are transient, but the Self continues. It
is that Self that Yogis, Buddhists, and Taoists seek to realize, and it may well be that Self which seeks its
own actualization (separate from the consciousness created by the brain underlying our mind; see Feuerstein,
2003; Kabat-Zinn, 1994). This is also the Self of Being and transcendence, as described by Maslow.

Social Relationships and Marriage
Social and personal relationships were very important to Rogers, both in therapy and in everyday life.
During each moment, we have our awareness (or consciousness), our experience (our perception of what
is happening), and our communication (our relational behavior).
is congruence between each of these phenomena.
congruence.

For the fully functioning person, there

Unfortunately, we tend to be a poor judge of our own

For example, if someone becomes angry with another person at a meeting or in a therapy

group, they may remain unaware of their anger, even though it may be quite obvious to everyone else in the
room. Thus, our relationship with others can reect the true nature of our own personality, and the degree to
which we are congruent. If others are congruent, and therefore are willing to talk to us openly and honestly,
it will encourage us to become more congruent and, consequently, more psychologically healthy (Rogers,
1961, 1980).

Curiously, the reason this became so important to Rogers was the lack of such meaningful

relationships in his own life.

Because his family followed strict, fundamentalist rules, they discouraged

relationships with people outside their family. The consequences were rather disturbing for Rogers:

. . .the

attitudes toward persons outside our large family can be summed up schematically in this way:

Other persons behave in dubious ways which we do not approve in our family. Many of them play cards, go
to movies, smoke, dance, drink, and engage in other activities, some unmentionable. So the best thing to do
is to be tolerant of them, since they may not know better, but to keep away from any close communication
with them and to live your life within the family. . .
I could sum up these boyhood years by saying that anything I would today regard as a close and
communicative interpersonal relationship with another was completely lacking during that period. . .I was
peculiar, a loner, with very little place or opportunity for a place in the world of persons. I was socially
incompetent in any but supercial contacts.

My fantasies during this period were denitely bizarre, and

probably would be classed as schizoid by a diagnostician, but fortunately I never came in contact with a
psychologist. (pp. 28-30; Rogers, 1980)

ship is congruent. Their congruence encourages the other person to be more congruent, which supports the
continued open communication on behalf of the rst person. This interplay goes back and forth, encouraging
continued and growing congruence in the relationship. As we will see below, this is basically the therapeutic
situation, in which the therapist is expected to be congruent. However, it certainly does not require a trained
therapist, since it occurs naturally in any situation in which one person is congruent from the beginning of
the relationship.
One of the most important, and hopefully meaningful, relationships in anyone's life is marriage. Rogers
was married for 55 years, and as the end of his wife's life approached he poured out his love to her with a
depth that astonished him (Rogers, 1980). As relationships became more and more meaningful to him, he
wanted to study the extraordinary relationships that become more than temporary. Although this is not
necessarily synonymous with marriage, it most typically is. So he conducted a series of informal interviews
with people who were, or had been, in lengthy relationships (at least 3 years). In comparing the relationships
that seemed successful, as compared to those that were unhappy or had already come to an end, Rogers
identied four factors that he believed were most important for long-term, healthy relationships: dedication
or commitment, communication, the dissolution of roles, and becoming a separate self (Rogers, 1972).

Dedication, Commitment: Marriage is challenging: love seems to fade, vows are forgotten or set
aside, religious rules are ignored (e.g., What therefore God has joined together, let no man put asunder.;
Matthew 19:6; Holy Bible, 1962). Rogers believed that in order for a relationship to last, each person must be
dedicated to their partnership. They must commit themselves to working together throughout the changing
process of their relationship, which is enriching their love and their life.

Communication: Communication encompasses much of human behavior, and it can be both subtle
and complex.

Communication itself is not a good thing, since many negative and hurtful things can be

communicated. However, Rogers believed that we need to communicate persistent feeling, whether positive
or negative, so that they don't overwhelm us and come out in inappropriate ways. It is always important
to express such communication in terms of your own thoughts and feelings, rather than projecting those
feelings onto others (especially in angry and/or accusatory ways). This process involves risk, but one must
be willing to risk the end of a relationship in order to allow it to grow.

Dissolution of Roles: Culture provides many expectations for the nature of relationships, whether
it be dating or something more permanent like marriage. According to Rogers, obeying the cultural rules
seems to contradict the idea of a growing and maturing relationship, a relationship that is moving forward
(toward actualization). However, when individuals make an intentional choice to fulll cultural expectations,
because they

want

to, then the relationship can certainly be actualizing for them.

Becoming a Separate Self : Rogers believed that a

living

partnership is composed of two people,

each of whom owns, respect, and develops his or her own selfhood (pg. 206; Rogers, 1972). While it may
seem contradictory that becoming an individual should enhance a relationship, as each person becomes more
real and more open they can bring these qualities into the relationship. As a result, the relationship can
contribute to the continued growth of each person.

Discussion Question: Consider Rogers' criteria for a successful marriage, which begins with commitment to the marriage. Given the divorce rate (which studies now place at over 60%), and ongoing political
debates about what marriage is or is not, what is your opinion of the status of marriage in society today?

Client-Centered and Person-Centered Therapy
Central to Rogers' view of psychotherapy is the relationship between the therapist and the client, and
we must again emphasize the distinction between a client and a patient. This involves shifting the emphasis
in therapy from a psychologist/psychiatrist who can x the patient to the client themselves, since only the
client can truly understand their own experiential eld. The therapist must provide a warm, safe environment
in which the client feels free to express whatever attitude they experience in the same way that they perceive
it. At the same time, the client experiences the therapist as someone temporarily divested of their own self,
in their complete desire to understand the client. The therapist can then accurately and objectively reect
the thoughts, feelings, perceptions, confusions, ambivalences, etc., of the client back to the client. In this
open, congruent, and supportive environment, the client is able to begin the process of reorganizing and
reintegrating their self-structure, and living congruently within that self-structure (Rogers, 1951).

In 1957, Rogers published an article entitled

Personality Change

The Necessary and Sucient Conditions of Therapeutic

(Rogers, 1957/1989). The list is fairly short and straightforward:

1. The client and the therapist must be in psychological contact.
2. The client must be in a state of incongruence, being vulnerable or anxious.
3. The therapist must be congruent in the relationship.
4. The therapist must experience unconditional positive regard for the client.
5. The therapist must experience empathic understanding of the client's frame of reference and endeavor
to communicate this experience to the client.
6. The client must perceive, at least to a minimal degree, the therapist's empathic understanding and
unconditional positive regard.
According to Rogers, there is nothing else that is required; if these conditions are met over a period of time,
there will be constructive personality change. What Rogers considered more remarkable are those factors
that do

not

seem necessary for positive therapeutic change. For example, these conditions do not apply to

one type of client, but to all clients, and they are not unique to client-centered therapy, but apply in all types
of therapy. The relationship between the therapist and client is also not unique, these factors hold true in
any interpersonal relationship. And most surprisingly, these conditions do not require any special training
on the part of therapist, or even an accurate diagnosis of the client's psychological problems! Any program
designed for the purpose of encouraging constructive change in the personality structure and behavior of
individuals, whether educational, military, correctional, or industrial, can benet from these conditions and
use them as a measure of the eectiveness of the program (Rogers, 1957).
Can any one of these conditions be considered more important than the others? Although they are all
necessary, Rogers came to believe that the critical factor may be the therapist's

empathic understanding

of the client (Rogers, 1980). The Dalai Lama (2001) has said that empathy is an essential rst step toward
a compassionate heart.

It brings us closer to others, and allows us to recognize the depth of their pain.

According to Rogers, empathy refers to entering the private world of the client, and moving about within
it without making any judgments. It is essential to set aside one's own views and values, so that the other
person's world may be entered without prejudice. Not just anyone can accomplish this successfully:
In some sense it means that you lay aside your self; this can only be done by persons who are secure
enough in themselves that they know they will not get lost in what may turn out to be the strange or bizarre
world of the other, and that they can comfortably return to their own world when they wish.

(pg.

Rogers, 1980)
Finally, let us consider group therapy situations.
hold true.

Within a group, all of the factors described above

Rogers, who late in his career was becoming more and more interested in the growth of all

people, including those reasonably well-adjusted and mature to begin with, became particularly interested
in

T-groups and encounter groups. These groups were developed following the proposition by Kurt

Lewin that modern society was overlooking the importance of training in human relations skills (the T
in T-group stands for training). Encounter groups were quite similar to T-groups, except that there was
a greater emphasis on personal growth and improved interpersonal communication through an experiential
process.

Each group has a leader, or facilitator, who fosters and encourages open communication.

The

group serves as a reection of the congruence, or lack thereof, in the communication of whoever is currently
expressing themselves.

As a result, the group hopefully moves toward congruence, and the subsequent

personal growth and actualization of the each individual (Rogers, 1970).
Given the usefulness of T-groups and encounter in a variety of settings, as well as the importance of
continued personal growth and actualization for the well-adjusted as well as those suering psychological

person-centered
approach, which encompasses client-centered therapy, student-centered teaching, and group-centered leader-

distress, Rogers shifted his focus from simply client-centered therapy to a more universal

ship (Rogers, 1980; see also Rogers & Roethlisberger, 1952/1993). Rogers believed that all people have within
them vast resources for self-understanding and for changing their self-concepts, attitudes, and behaviors. In
all relationships, whether therapist-client, parent-child, teacher-student, leader-group, employer-employee,
etc., there are three elements that can foster personal growth: genuineness or congruence, acceptance or

caring, and empathic understanding.

When these elements are fostered in any setting, there is greater

freedom to be the true, whole person.

The implications go far beyond individual relationships.

in what seems to be an increasingly dangerous world.

We live

Globalism has brought with it global tension and

conict. However, Rogers argued that a person-centered approach would help to ease intercultural tension,
by helping each of us to learn to appreciate and understand others. Whether the cultural dierences are
political, racial, ethnic, economic, whatever, as more leaders become person-centered there is the possibility
for future growth of intercultural understanding and cooperation (Rogers, 1977).

Abraham Maslow and Holistic-Dynamic Psychology
Maslow stands alongside Rogers as one of the founders of humanistic psychology.

Although he began

his career working with two of the most famous experimental psychologists in America, he was profoundly
inuenced by the events that led into World War II. He became devoted to studying the more virtuous aspects
of personality, and he may be viewed as one of the founders of positive psychology. Well-known primarily for
his work on self-actualization, Maslow also had a signicant impact on the eld of management. His fame
in both psychology and business makes him a candidate for being, perhaps, the best-known psychologist of
all time (Freud is certainly more famous, but remember that he was a psychiatrist). According to Maslow,
his

holistic-dynamic theory of personality was a blend of theories that had come before his:
This theory is, I think, in the functionalist tradition of James and Dewey, and is fused with the holism of

Wertheimer, Goldstein, and Gestalt psychology, and with the dynamicism of Freud, Fromm, Horney, Reich,
Jung, and Adler. This integration or synthesis may be called a holistic-dynamic theory. (pg. 35; Maslow,
1970)

Brief Biography of Abraham Maslow
Abraham H. Maslow was born on April 1, 1908 in Brooklyn, New York, the rst of seven children. His
father, Samuel, had left Kiev, Russia at just 14 years old. When Samuel Maslow arrived in America he had
no money and did not speak English. Samuel Maslow spent a few years in Philadelphia, doing odd jobs and
learning the language, before moving to New York City, where he married his rst cousin Rose and began
a cooperage business (a cooper builds and repairs barrels). Samuel and Rose Maslow did not have a happy
marriage, and Abraham Maslow was particularly sensitive to this fact. Maslow resented his father's frequent
absences, and apparently hated his mother. His mother was a superstitious woman, who severely punished
Maslow for even minor misbehavior by threatening him with God's wrath.

Maslow developed an intense

distrust of religion, and was proud to consider himself an atheist (Gabor, 2000; Homan, 1988; Maddi &
Costa, 1972).
Maslow's childhood was no better outside the home. Anti-Semitism was rampant in New York. Many
teachers were cruel, and he overheard them say nasty things about him. He had no friends, and there were
anti-Semitic gangs that would nd and beat up Jewish children. At one point he decided to join a Jewish
gang for protection, but he didn't have the right attitude:
I wanted to be a member of the gang, but I couldn't: they rejected me because I couldn't kill cats. . .We'd
stake out a cat on a [clothesline] and stand back so many paces and throw rocks at it and kill it.
And the other thing was to throw rocks at the girls on the corner. Now I knew that the girls liked it,
and yet I couldn't throw rocks at girls and I couldn't kill cats, so I was ruled out of the gang, and I could
never be the gangster that I wanted to become. (pg. 4; Maslow, cited in Homan, 1988)
With six more children joining the family, one every couple of years, the family was constantly moving
and, following the troubling death of one of his little sisters (Maslow blamed her illness, in part, on their
mother's neglect), Maslow became a very unhappy and shy child.

He also thought he was terribly ugly,

something his father said openly at a large family gathering! Perhaps worst of all, he felt profoundly strange
and dierent than other children, largely because he was so intellectual. Maslow reconciled with his father
later in life. During the depression, Samuel Maslow lost his business. By that time he had divorced Maslow's
mother, Rose, and he moved in with his son.

The two became close, and after Samuel Maslow died, his

son remembered him fondly. Maslow never forgave his mother, however. Some of the childhood stories he
related were shockingly cruel. Once, he had searched through second-hand record shops for some special
78-RPM records. When he failed to put them away soon after returning home, his mother stomped them
into pieces on the living room oor. Another time, Maslow brought home two abandoned kittens he had

found. When his mother caught him feeding them a saucer of milk, she grabbed the kittens and smashed
their heads against a wall until they were dead! Later in life, he refused to even attend her funeral.
What I had reacted to and totally hated and rejected was not only her physical appearance, but also
her values and world view. . .I've always wondered where my utopianism, ethical stress, humanism, stress on
kindness, love, friendship, and all the rest came from. I knew certainly of the direct consequences of having
no mother-love. But the whole thrust of my life-philosophy and all my research and theorizing also has its
roots in a hatred for and revulsion against everything she stood for. (pg. 9; Maslow cited in Homan, 1988)
Maslow spent much of his childhood reading, and despite the treatment he received from many of his
prejudiced teachers, he loved to learn. After high school Maslow won a scholarship to Cornell University, but
encountered pervasive anti-Semitism throughout his rst year. So he transferred to City College, where he
rst studied the work of behavioral scientists like John B. Watson. He was impressed by Watson's desire to
use the newly created science of behaviorism to ght social problems, such as racial and ethnic discrimination.
At the same time, however, Maslow had fallen in love with his rst cousin Bertha Goodman, a relationship
his parents strongly opposed. So Maslow left for the University of Wisconsin (Gabor, 2000; Homan, 1988;
Maddi & Costa, 1972). Bertha Goodman followed, and they were soon married. Marriage boosted Maslow's
self-esteem, and provided him with a sense of purpose in life. He later said that life didn't really start for
me until I got married and went to Wisconsin (pg. 128; cited in Maddi & Costa, 1972).
In Wisconsin, Maslow studied the behavior of primates under the supervision of the renowned Harry Harlow (most famous for his studies on

contact comfort). One day, while watching some monkeys seemingly

enjoy munching on peanuts and other treats, Maslow recognized that appetite and hunger are two dierent
things. Thus, motivation must be comprised of separate elements as well. In another study, Maslow tried to
address the dierent aspects of Freud and Adler's psychodynamic perspectives by observing dominance behavior amongst the monkeys. His colleagues and professors, however, had little interest in the psychoanalytic
science that they considered to be a European endeavor. Maslow completed his Ph.D. at Wisconsin in 1934,
and then returned to New York. He earned a position at Columbia University with the renowned Edward
Thorndike, and began studying the relative contributions of heredity and environment on social behavior, as
part of a project to study factors involved in poverty, illiteracy, and crime. As a curious side note, Thorndike
had also developed an IQ test; Maslow scored 195 on this test, one of the highest scores ever recorded.
During this time at Columbia University, Maslow also began relationships with many of the psychologists,
sociologists, and anthropologists who had ed Nazi Germany. He was very impressed with Max Wertheimer,
one of the founders of Gestalt psychology, and who helped to lay the foundation for positive psychology:
Are there not tendencies in men and in children to be kind, to deal sincerely [and] justly with the other
fellow? Are these nothing but internalized rules on the basis of compulsion and fear? he asked rhetorically.
(pg. 159; Wertheimer, cited in Gabor, 2000)
Maslow was one of the rst students to study with Alfred Adler in America, being particularly impressed
with Adler's work helping academically-challenged children to succeed despite their low IQ scores. Maslow
also studied with Erich Fromm, Karen Horney, and Ruth Benedict. Benedict was an anthropologist who
encouraged Maslow to gain some eld experience. She sponsored a grant application that Maslow received
to study the Blackfoot Indians. During the summer of 1938, Maslow examined the dominance and emotional
security of the Blackfoot Indians. He was impressed by their culture, and recognized what he believed was
an innate need to experience a sense of purpose in life, a sense of meaning. A few years later, shortly after
the beginning of World War II, Maslow had an epiphany regarding psychology's failure to understand the
true nature of people. He devoted the rest of his life to the study of a hopeful psychology (Gabor, 2000;
Homan, 1988; Maddi & Costa, 1972).
Maslow taught for a few years at Brooklyn College, and also served as the plant manager for the Maslow
Cooperage Corporation (from 1947-1949). In 1951 he was appointed Professor and Chair of the Department
of Psychology at Brandeis University, where he conducted the research and wrote the books for which he is
most famous. By the late 1960s, Maslow had become disillusioned with academic life. He had suered a heart
attack in 1966, and seemed somewhat disconnected from the very department he had helped to form. In 1969,
however, he accepted a four year grant from the Laughlin Foundation, primarily to study the philosophy of
democracy, economics, and ethics as inuenced by humanistic psychology. He had been troubled by what he

viewed as a loss of faith in American values, and he was greatly enjoying his time working in California. He
also attended management seminars at the Saga Corporation, urging the participants to commit themselves
to humanistic management. One day in June, 1970, he was jogging slowly when he suered a massive heart
attack. He was already dead by the time his wife rushed over to him (Gabor, 2000; Homan, 1988; Maddi
& Costa, 1972). He was only 62 years old. Shortly after his death, the

International Study Project

of Menlo

Park, CA published a memorial volume in tribute to Abraham Maslow (International Study Project, 1972).

Placing Maslow in Context: Beyond Humanistic Psychology
Whereas Carl Rogers is often thought of as the founder of humanistic psychology, in large part because
of his emphasis on psychotherapy, it was Maslow who studied in great detail the most signicant theoretical
aspect of it: self-actualization. In addition to studying self-actualization, he applied it both in psychology
and beyond. His application of self-actualization to management continued the classic relationship between
psychology and business (which began with John B. Watson and his application of psychological principles
to advertising). Unfortunately, Maslow died just as he was beginning to study his proposed fourth force:
transpersonal psychology. Transpersonal psychology oered a connection between psychology and many of
the Eastern philosophies associated with Yoga and Buddhism, and also provided a foundation for the study
of positive psychology.
Maslow's interest in business and management has quite possibly led to his being the most famous
psychologist of all time, since he is well-known in both psychology and business. If he had continued being
a vocal advocate for transpersonal psychology (if not for his untimely death at an early age), given today's
growing interest in Eastern philosophy and psychology and the establishment of positive psychology as a
goal for the eld of psychology by former APA President Martin Seligman, Maslow may well have become
even more famous.

It is interesting to note that someone so truly visionary seems to have become that

way as a result of studying people whom he felt were themselves self-actualized. If positive psychology, the
psychology of virtue and values, becomes the heir of Maslow's goal, it should become a signicant force in
the eld of psychology. That will be Maslow's true legacy.

The Importance of Values in the Science of Psychology
A common criticism leveled against many personality theorists is that they have not conrmed their
theories in a strict, scientic manner.

When one goes so far as to consider

values, which are typically

associated with religious morality, there is even greater resistance on the part of those who would have
psychology become truly scientic to consider such matters worthy of examination. However, Maslow felt
that:
Both orthodox science and orthodox religion have been institutionalized and frozen into a mutually
excluding dichotomy. . .One consequence is that they are both pathologized, split into sickness, ripped apart
into a crippled half-science and a crippled half-religion. . .As a result. . .the student who becomes a scientist
automatically gives up a great deal of life, especially its richest portions. (pg. 119; Maslow, 1966)
Consequently, Maslow urged that we need to be fully aware of our values at all times, and aware of
how our values inuence us in our study of psychology. Although people approach the world in common
ways, they also pay selective attention to what is happening, and they reshue the events occurring around
them according to their own interests, needs, desires, fears, etc. Consequently, Maslow believed that paying
attention to human values, particularly to an individual's values, actually helps the psychological scientist
achieve the goal of clearly understanding human behavior (Maslow, 1970). In a similar vein, when Maslow
co-authored an abnormal psychology text early in his career, he included a chapter on normal psychology.
His description of the characteristics of a healthy, normal personality provides an interesting foreshadowing
of his research on self-actualization (Maslow & Mittelmann, 1941).
Maslow felt so strongly about the loss of values in our society that he helped to organize a conference and
then served as editor for a book entitled

New Knowledge in Human Values

(Maslow, 1959). In the preface,

Maslow laments that  . . .the ultimate disease of our time is valuelessness. . .this state is more crucially
dangerous than ever before in history. . . (pg.

vii; Maslow, 1959).

Maslow does suggest, however, that

something can be done about this loss of values, if only people will try. In the book, he brought together
an interesting variety of individuals, including: Kurt Goldstein, a well-known neurophysiologist who studied
the holistic function of healthy vs. brain-damaged patients and who coined the term self-actualization; D. T.

173

Suzuki, a renowned Zen Buddhist scholar; and Paul Tillich, a highly respected existential theologian (who
had a direct and signicant inuence on the career of Rollo May). There are also chapters by Gordon Allport
and Erich Fromm. In his own chapter, Maslow concludes:
If we wish to help humans to become more fully human, we must realize not only that they try to realize
themselves but that they are also reluctant or afraid or unable to do so.

Only by fully appreciating this

dialectic between sickness and health can we help to tip the balance in favor of health. (pg. 135; Maslow,
1959)

Discussion Question: Maslow believed that values are very important, not only in the study of psychology, but in society as well. Do you agree? When politicians or religious leaders talk about values, do
you think they represent meaningful, true values, or do they just support the values that are an advantage
to their own goal or the goals of their political party or church?

The Hierarchy of Needs
hierarchy of needs. Developed within the context of a
basic
needs: physiological needs, safety needs, belongingness and love needs, esteem needs, and the
need for self-actualization. It is generally accepted that individuals must move through the hierarchy
Maslow's is undoubtedly best known for his

theory of human motivation, Maslow believed that human behavior is driven and guided by a set of

in order, satisfying the needs at each level before one can move on to a higher level. The reason for this
is that lower needs tend to occupy the mind if they remain unsatised.

How easy is it to work or study

when you are really hungry or thirsty? But Maslow did not consider the hierarchy to be rigid. For example,
he encountered some people for whom self-esteem was more important than love, individuals suering from
antisocial personality disorder seem to have a permanent loss of the need for love, or if a need has been
satised for a long time it may become less important. As lower needs are becoming satised, though not
yet fully satised, higher needs may begin to present themselves. And of course there are sometimes multiple
determinants of behavior, making the relationship between a given behavior and a basic need dicult to
identify (Maslow, 1943/1973; Maslow, 1970).
The physiological needs are based, in part, on the concept of

homeostasis, the natural tendency of the

body to maintain critical biological levels of essential elements or conditions, such as water, salt, energy, and
body temperature. Sexual activity, though not essential for the individual, is biologically necessary for the
human species to survive. Maslow described the physiological needs as the most

prepotent. In other words,

if a person is lacking everything in life, having failed to satisfy physiological, safety, belongingness and love,
and esteem needs, their consciousness will most like be consumed with their desire for food and water. As
the lowest and most clearly biological of the needs, these are also the most animal-like of our behavior. In
Western culture, however, it is rare to nd someone who is actually starving. So when we talk about being
hungry, we are really talking about an appetite, rather than real hunger (Maslow, 1943/1973; Maslow, 1970).
Many Americans are fascinated by stories such as those of the ill-fated Donner party, trapped in the Sierra
Nevada mountains during the winter of 1846-1847, and the Uruguayan soccer team whose plane crashed in
the Andes mountains in 1972. In each case, either some or all of the survivors were forced to cannibalize
those who had died. As shocking as such stories are, they demonstrate just how powerful our physiological
needs can be.
The safety needs can easily be seen in young children.

They are easily startled or frightened by loud

noises, ashing lights, and rough handling. They can become quite upset when other family members are
ghting, since it disrupts the feeling of safety usually associated with the home. According to Maslow, many
adult neurotics are like children who do not feel safe. From another perspective, that of Erik Erikson, children
and adults raised in such an environment do not trust the environment to provide for their needs. Although
it can be argued that few people in America seriously suer from a lack of satisfying physiological needs,
there are many people who live unsafe lives. For example, inner city crime, abusive spouses and parents,
incurable diseases like HIV/AIDS, all present life threatening dangers to many people on a daily basis.
One place where we expect our children to be safe is in school. However, as we saw in the last chapter
(in the section on the martial arts), 160,000 children each day are too frightened to attend school (Nathan,
2005).

Juvonen et al.

(2006) looked at the eects of ethnic diversity on children's perception of safety

in urban middle schools (Grade 6).

They surveyed approximately 2,000 students in 99 classrooms in the

greater Los Angeles area. The ethnicity of the students in this study was 46 percent Latino (primarily of
Mexican origin), 29 percent African American, 9 percent Asian (primarily East Asian), 9 percent Caucasian,
and 7 percent multiracial.

When a given classroom, or a given school, is more ethnically diverse, both

African American and Latino students felt safer, were harassed less by peers, felt less lonely, and they had
higher levels of self-worth (even when the authors controlled for dierences in academic engagement). Thus,
it appears that ethnic diversity in schools leads toward satisfaction of the need for safety, at least in one
important area of a child's life. Unfortunately, most minority students continue to be educated in schools
that are largely ethnically segregated (Juvonen, et al., 2006).
Throughout the evolution of the human species we found safety primarily within our family, tribal group,
or our community. It was within those groups that we shared the hunting and gathering that provided food.
Once the physiological and safety needs have been fairly well satised, according to Maslow, the person
will feel keenly, as never before, the absence of friends, or a sweetheart, or a wife, or children (Maslow,
1970). Although there is little scientic conrmation of the belongingness and love needs, many therapists
attribute much of human suering to society's thwarting of the need for love and aection. Most notable
among personality theorists who addressed this issue was Wilhelm Reich. An important aspect of love and
aection is sex.

Although sex is often considered a physiological need, given its role in procreation, sex

is what Maslow referred to as a multidetermined behavior. In other words, it serves both a physiological
role (procreation) and a belongingness/love role (the tenderness and/or passion of the physical side of love).
Maslow was also careful to point out that love needs involve both giving and receiving love in order for them
to be fully satised (Maslow, 1943/1973; Maslow, 1970).
Maslow believed that all people desire a stable and rmly based high evaluation of themselves and
others (at least the others who comprise their close relationships). This need for self-esteem, or self-respect,
involves two components. First is the desire to feel competent, strong, and successful (similar to Bandura's
self-ecacy). Second is the need for prestige or status, which can range from simple recognition to fame and
glory. Maslow credited Adler for addressing this human need, but felt that Freud had neglected it. Maslow
also believed that the need for self-esteem was becoming a central issue in therapy for many psychotherapists.
However, as we saw in Chapter 12, Albert Ellis considers self-esteem to be a sickness. Ellis' concern is that
self-esteem, including eorts to boost self-esteem in therapy, requires that people rate themselves, something
that Ellis felt will eventually lead to a negative evaluation (no one is perfect!). Maslow did acknowledge that
the healthiest self-esteem is based on well-earned and deserved respect from others, rather than eeting fame
or celebrity status (Maslow, 1943/1973; Maslow, 1970).
When all of these lower needs (physiological, safety, belongingness and love, and esteem) have been largely
satised, we may still feel restless and discontented unless we are doing what is right for ourselves. What
a man

can

be, he

must

be (pg. 46; Maslow, 1970). Thus, the need for self-actualization, which Maslow

Being-need, as opposed to the
deciency-needs (Maslow, 1968). We will examine self-actualization in more detail in the following

described as the highest of the basic needs, can also be referred to as a
lower

section.

Figure 8.2

Maslow's hierarchy of needs is based on a theory of motivation. Individuals must essentially satisfy the
lower deciency needs before they become focused on satisfying the higher Being needs. Beyond even the
Being needs there is something more, a state of transcendence that ties all people and the whole of creation
together.
Although Maslow recognized that humans no longer have instincts in the technical sense, we nonetheless
share basic drives with other animals.

We get hungry, even though how and what we eat is determined

culturally. We need to be safe, like any other animal, but again we seek and maintain our safety in dierent
ways (such as having a police force to provide safety for us).
animals, therefore, Maslow referred to the basic needs as

Given our fundamental similarity to other

instinctoid. The lower the need the more animal-

like it is, the higher the need, the more human it is, and self-actualization was, in Maslow's opinion, uniquely
human (Maslow, 1970).
In addition to the basic needs, Maslow referred to

cognitive needs and aesthetic needs. Little is

known about cognitive needs, since they are seldom an important focus in clinic settings. However, he felt
there were ample grounds for proposing that there are positive impulses to know, to satisfy curiosity, to
understand, and to explain.

The eight-fold path described by the Buddha, some 2,600 years ago, begins

with right knowledge. The importance of mental stimulation for some people is described quite vividly by
Maslow:
I have seen a few cases in which it seemed clear to me that the pathology (boredom, loss of zest in life,

CHAPTER 8. CARL ROGERS AND ABRAHAM MASLOW

176

self-dislike, general depression of the bodily functions, steady deterioration of the intellectual life, of tastes,
etc.) were produced in intelligent people leading stupid lives in stupid jobs. I have at least one case in which
the appropriate cognitive therapy (resuming part-time studies, getting a position that was more intellectually
demanding, insight) removed the symptoms.
I have seen many women, intelligent, prosperous, and unoccupied, slowly develop these same symptoms of
intellectual inanition. Those who followed my recommendation to immerse themselves in something worthy
of them showed improvement or cure often enough to impress me with the reality of the cognitive needs.
(pg. 49; Maslow, 1970)
There are also classic studies on the importance of environmental enrichment on the structural development of the brain itself (Diamond et al., 1975; Globus, et al., 1973; Greenough & Volkmar, 1973; Rosenzweig,
1984; Spinelli & Jensen, 1979; Spinelli, Jensen, & DiPrisco, 1980). Even less is known about the aesthetic
needs, but Maslow was convinced that some people need to experience, indeed they crave, beauty in their
world. Ancient cave drawings have been found that seem to serve no other purpose than being art. The
cognitive and aesthetic needs may very well have been fundamental to our evolution as modern humans.

Self-Actualization
Maslow began his studies on self-actualization in order to satisfy his own curiosity about people who
seemed to be fullling their unique potential as individuals. He did not intend to undertake a formal research project, but he was so impressed by his results that he felt compelled to report his ndings. Amongst
people he knew personally and public and historical gures, he looked for individuals who appeared to have
made full use of their talents, capacities, and potentialities. In other words, people who have developed or
are developing to the full stature of which they are capable (Maslow, 1970). His list of those who clearly
seemed self-actualized included Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jeerson, Albert Einstein, Eleanor Roosevelt,
Jane Addams, William James, Albert Schweitzer, Aldous Huxley, and Baruch Spinoza.

His list of indi-

viduals who were most-likely self-actualized included Goethe (possibly the great-grandfather of Carl Jung),
George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Harriet Tubman (born into slavery, she became a conductor on the
Underground Railroad prior to the Civil War), and George Washington Carver (born into slavery at the
end of the Civil War, he became an agricultural chemist and prolic inventor). In addition to the positive
attributes listed above, Maslow also considered it very important that there be no evidence of psychopathology in those he chose to study.

After comparing the seemingly self-actualized individuals to people who

did not seem to have fullled their lives, Maslow identied fourteen characteristics of self-actualizing people
(Maslow, 1950/1973, 1970), as follows:

More Ecient Perception of Reality and More Comfortable Relations with It: Self-actualizing
people have an ability to recognize fakers, those who present a false persona.

More than that, however,

Maslow believed they could recognize hidden or confused realities in all aspects of life: science, politics,
values and ethics, etc.

They are not afraid of the unknown or people who are dierent, they nd such

dierences to be a pleasant challenge.

Although a high IQ may be associated with this characteristic, it

is not uncommon to nd those who are seemingly intelligent yet unable to be creative in their eorts to
discover new phenomena. Thus, the perception of reality is not simply the same as being smart.

Acceptance (Self, Others, Nature): Similar to the approach Albert Ellis took with REBT (and his
hypothesized dangers inherent in self-esteem), Maslow believed that self-actualizing people accept themselves
as they are, including their faults and the dierences between their personal reality and their ideal image of
themselves. This is not to say that they are without guilt. They are concerned about personal faults that
can be improved, any remaining habits or psychological issues that are unhealthy (e.g., prejudice, jealousy,
etc.), and the shortcomings of their community and/or culture.

Spontaneity: The lives of self-actualizing people are marked by simplicity and a natural ease as they
pursue their goals. Their outward behavior is relatively spontaneous, and their inner life (thoughts, drives,
etc.) is particularly so. In spite of this spontaneity, they are not always unconventional, because they can
easily accept the constraints of society and nd their own way to t in without being untrue to their own
sense of self.

Problem-Centering: Self-actualizing individuals are highly problem-centered, not ego-centered. The
problems they focus on are typically not their own, however. They focus on problems outside themselves,

177

on important causes they would describe as necessary.

Solving such problems is taken as their duty or

responsibility, rather than as something they want to do for themselves.

The Quality of Detachment; the Need for Privacy: Whereas social withdrawal is often seen as
psychologically unhealthy, self-actualizing people enjoy their privacy. They can remain calm as they separate
themselves from problematic situations, remaining above the fray. In accordance with this healthy form of
detachment, they are active, responsible, self-disciplined individuals in charge of their own lives.

Maslow

believed that they have more free will than the average person.

Figure 8.3

Self-actualized individuals need their privacy. This may help them put life in perspective and prepare for
each day.
Autonomy, Independence of Culture and Environment: As an extension of the preceding characteristics, self-actualizing individuals are growth-motivated as opposed to being deciency-motivated. They
do not need the presence, companionship, or approval of others. Indeed, they may be hampered by others.
The love, honor, esteem, etc., that can be bestowed by others has become less important to someone who is
self-actualizing than self-development and inner growth.

Continued Freshness of Appreciation: Self-actualizing people are able to appreciate the wonders,
as well as the common aspects, of life again and again. Such feelings may not occur all the time, but they
can occur in the most unexpected ways and at unexpected times. Maslow oered a surprising evaluation of
the importance of this characteristic of self-actualization:
I have also become convinced that getting used to our blessings is one of the most important nonevil
generators of human evil, tragedy, and suering.

What we take for granted we undervalue, and we are

therefore too apt to sell a valuable birthright for a mess of pottage, leaving behind regret, remorse, and
a lowering of self-esteem.

Wives, husbands, children, friends are unfortunately more apt to be loved and

appreciated after they have died than while they are still available. Something similar is true for physical
health, for political freedoms, for economic well-being; we learn their true value after we have lost them.
(pp. 163-164; Maslow, 1970)

The Mystic Experience or Oceanic Feeling; Peak Experiences: The dierence between a
mystic experience (also known as an oceanic feeling) and a peak experience is a matter of denition.
Mystic experiences are viewed as gifts from God, something reserved for special or deserving (i.e., faithful)
servants. Maslow, however, believed that this was a natural occurrence that could happen for anyone, and

CHAPTER 8. CARL ROGERS AND ABRAHAM MASLOW

178

to some extent probably did.

He assigned the psychological term of peak experiences.

Such experiences

tend to be sudden feelings of limitless horizons opening up to one's vision, simultaneous feelings of great
power and great vulnerability, feelings of ecstasy, wonder and awe, a loss of the sense of time and place,
and the feeling that something extraordinary and transformative has happened.

Self-actualizers who do

not typically experience these peaks, the so-called  non-peakers, are more likely to become direct agents
of social change, the reformers, politicians, crusaders, and so on.

The more transcendent  peakers, in

contrast, become the poets, musicians, philosophers, and theologians.
Maslow devoted a great deal of attention to peak experiences, including their relationship to religion.
At the core of religion, according to Maslow, is the private illumination or revelation of spiritual leaders.
Such experiences seem to be very similar to peak experiences, and Maslow suggests that throughout history
these peak experiences may have been mistaken for revelations from God. In his own studies, Maslow found
that people who were spiritual, but not religious (i.e., not hindered by the doctrine of a specic faith or
church), actually had more peak experiences than other people. Part of the explanation for this, according
to Maslow, is that such people need to be more serious about their ethics, values, and philosophy of life,
since their guidance and motivation must come from within.

Individuals who seek such an appreciation

of life may help themselves to experience an extended form of peak experience that Maslow called the

plateau experience. Plateau experiences always have both noetic and cognitive elements, whereas peak
experiences can be entirely emotional (Maslow, 1964). Put another way, plateau experiences involve serene

Being-cognition, as opposed to the more climactic peak experiences (Maslow, 1971).
Gemeinschaftsgefuhl: A word invented by Alfred Adler, gemeinschatfsgefuhl refers to the profound

and contemplative

feelings of identication, sympathy, and aection for other people that are common in self-actualization
individuals.

Although self-actualizers may often feel apart from others, like a stranger in a strange land,

becoming upset by the shortcomings of the average person, they nonetheless feel a sense of kinship with
others. These feelings lead to a sincere desire to help the human race.

Interpersonal Relations: Maslow believed that self-actualizers have deeper and more profound personal relationships than other people. They tend to be kind to everyone, and are especially fond of children.
Maslow described this characteristic as compassion for all mankind, a perspective that would t well with
Buddhist and Christian philosophies.

The Democratic Character Structure: Self-actualizing people are typically friendly with anyone, regardless of class, race, political beliefs, or education. They can learn from anyone who has something to teach
them. They respect all people, simply because they are people. They are not, however, undiscriminating:
The careful distinction must be made between this democratic feeling and a lack of discrimination in taste,
of an undiscriminating equalizing of any one human being with any other. These individuals, themselves
elite, select for their friends elite, but this is an elite of character, capacity, and talent, rather than of birth,
race, blood, name, family, age, youth, fame, or power. (pg. 168; Maslow, 1970)

Discrimination Between Means and Ends, Between Good and Evil: Self-actualizers know the
dierence between right and wrong. They are ethical, have high moral standards, and they do good things
while avoiding doing bad things. They do not experience the average person's confusion or inconsistency in
making ethical choices. They tend to focus on ends, rather than means, although they sometimes become
absorbed in the means themselves, viewing the process itself as a series of ends.

Philosophical, Unhostile Sense of Humor: The sense of humor shared by self-actualizers is not
typical. They do not laugh at hostile, superior, or rebellious humor. They do not tell jokes that make fun of
other people. Instead, they poke fun at people in general for being foolish, or trying to claim a place in the
universe that is beyond us. Such humor often takes the form of poking fun at oneself, but not in a clown-like
way. Although such humor can be found in nearly every aspect of life, to non-self-actualizing people the
self-actualizers seem to be somewhat sober and serious.

Creativeness: According to Maslow, self-actualizing people are universally creative. This is not the
creativity associated with genius, such as that of Mozart or Thomas Edison, but rather the fresh and naive
creativity of an unspoiled child. Maslow believed that this creativity was a natural potential given to all
humans at their birth, but that the constraints on behavior inherent in most cultures lead to its suppression.
As desirable as self-actualization may seem, self-actualizing individuals still face problems in their lives.

179

According to Maslow, they are typically not well adjusted. This is because they resist being enculturated.
They do not stand out in grossly abnormal ways, but there is a certain inner detachment from the culture
in which they live. They are not viewed as rebels in the adolescent sense, though they may be rebels while
growing up, but rather they work steadily toward social change and/or the accomplishment of their goals. As
a result of their immersion in some personal goal, they may lose interest in or patience with common people
and common social practices. Thus, they may seem detached, insulting, absent-minded, or humorless. They
can seem boring, stubborn, or irritating, particularly because they are often supercially vain and proud only
of their own accomplishments and their own family, friends, and work. According to Maslow, outbursts of
temper are not rare. Maslow argued that there are, in fact, people who become saints, movers and shakers,
creators, and sages. However, these same people can be irritating, selsh, angry, or depressed. No one is
perfect, not even those who are self-actualizing (Maslow, 1950/1973, 1970).

Discussion Question: Consider Maslow's characteristics of self-actualizing people. Which of those
characteristics do you think are part of your personality? Are there any characteristics that you think may
be particularly dicult for you to achieve?

Obstacles to Self-Actualization
In The Farther Reaches of Human Nature

(Maslow, 1971), which was completed by Maslow's wife and

one of his colleagues shortly after Maslow's death, Maslow described self-actualization as something that
one does not obtain or fulll at a specic point in time. Rather, it is an ongoing process of self-actualizing,
characterized for some by brief periods of self-actualization (the peak experiences, for example). Maslow also
described two major obstacles to achieving self-actualization:

desacralizing and the Jonah complex. The

Jonah complex, a name suggested by Maslow's friend Professor Frank Manuel, refers to being afraid of one's
own greatness, or evading one's destiny or calling in life. Maslow specically described this as a non-Freudian
defense mechanism in which a person is as afraid of the best aspects of their psyche as they are afraid of the
worst aspects of their psyche (i.e., the socially unacceptable id impulses). He described the process of this fear
as a recognition, despite how much we enjoy the godlike possibilities revealed by our nest accomplishments,
of the weakness, awe, and fear we experience when we achieve those accomplishments. According to Maslow,
great emotions after all can in

fact

overwhelm us (Maslow, 1971). Nonetheless, he encouraged people to

strive for greatness, within a reasonable sense of their own limitations.
A very important defense mechanism, which aects young people in particular, is what Maslow called
desacralizing. The source of this problem is usually found within the family:
These youngsters mistrust the possibility of values and virtues. They feel themselves swindled or thwarted
in their lives. Most of them have, in fact, dopey parents whom they don't respect very much, parents who are
quite confused themselves about values and who, frequently, are simply terried of their children and never
punish them or stop them from doing things that are wrong. So you have a situation where the youngsters
simply despise their elders - often for good and sucient reason. (pg. 49; Maslow, 1971)
As a result, children grow up without respect for their elders, or for anything their elders consider
important. The values of the culture itself can be called into question. While such a situation may sometimes
be important for changing social conventions that unfairly discriminate against some people, can we really
aord to live in a society in which

Indeed, can such a society or culture continue to

resacralizing. Maslow noted that he had to make up the words

desacralizing and resacralizing because the English language is rotten for good people.

It has no decent

vocabulary for the virtues (Maslow, 1971). Resacralizing means being willing to see the sacred, the eternal,
the symbolic. As an example, Maslow suggested considering a medical student dissecting a human brain.
Would such a student see the brain simply as a biological organ, or would they be awed by it, also seeing
the brain as a sacred object, including even its poetic aspects? This concept is particularly important for
counselors working with the aged, people approaching the end of their lives, and may be critical for helping
them move toward self-actualization. According to Maslow, when someone asks a counselor for help with
the self-actualizing process, the counselor had better have an answer for them, or we're not doing what it
is our job to do (Maslow, 1971).

Discussion Question: Maslow believed that desacralizing was particularly challenging for young people.
Do you think our society has lost its way, have we lost sight of meaningful values? Is nothing sacred anymore?

Is there anything that you do in your life to recognize something as sacred in a way that has real meaning
for your community?
Maslow had something else interesting to say about self-actualization in

Nature :

The Farther Reaches of Human

"What does self-actualization mean in moment-to-moment terms? What does it mean on Tuesday

at four o'clock?" (pg. 41). Consequently, he oered a preliminary suggestion for an operational denition of
the process by which self-actualization occurs. In other words, what are the behaviors exhibited by people
on the path toward fullling or achieving the fourteen characteristics of self-actualized people described
above? Sadly, this could only remain a preliminary description, i.e., they are "ideas that are in midstream
rather than ready for formulation into a nal version," because this book was published after Maslow's death
(having been put together before his sudden and unexpected heart attack).

(they have "the courage to give them up"). Although

this requires that they face up to painful experiences, it is more benecial than the consequences of
defenses such as repression.

Being and Transcendence
Maslow had great hope and optimism for the human race.

Although self-actualization might seem

to be the pinnacle of personal human achievement, he viewed Humanistic Psychology, or

Third Force

Psychology, as just another step in our progression:
I should say also that I consider Humanistic, Third Force Psychology to be transitional, a preparation
for a still higher Fourth Psychology, transpersonal, transhuman, centered in the cosmos rather than in
human needs and interest, going beyond humanness, identity, self-actualization, and the like. . .These new
developments may very well oer a tangible, usable, eective satisfaction of the frustrated idealism of
many quietly desperate people, especially young people. These psychologies give promise of developing into
the life-philosophy, the religion-surrogate, the value-system, the life-program that these people have been
missing. Without the transcendent and the transpersonal, we get sick, violent, and nihilistic, or else hopeless
and apathetic. We need something bigger than we are to be awed by and to commit ourselves to in a new,
naturalistic, empirical, non-churchly sense, perhaps as Thoreau and Whitman, William James and John
Dewey did. (pp. iii-iv; Maslow, 1968)
Although Maslow wrote about this need for a

Fourth Force Psychology in 1968, it was not until

the year 1998 that APA President Martin Seligman issued his call for the pursuit of positive psychology
as an active force in the eld of psychology. Maslow believed that all self-actualizing people were involved
in some calling or vocation, a cause outside of themselves, something that fate has called them to and
that they love doing.

In so doing, they devote themselves to the search for

Being-values (or B-values;

Maslow, 1964, 1967/2008, 1968). The desire to attain self-actualization results in the B-values acting like

of a

metacounselor, a counselor trained in philosophical and spiritual matters that go far beyond the

more instinctoid training of the traditional psychoanalyst (Maslow, 1967/2008). The B-values identied by
Maslow (1964) are an interesting blend of the characteristics of self-actualizing individuals and the human
needs described by Henry Murray: truth, goodness, beauty, wholeness, dichotomy-transcendence, aliveness,
uniqueness, perfection, necessity, completion, justice, order, simplicity, richness, eortlessness, playfulness,
self-suciency.
Transcendence is typically associated with people who are religious, spiritual, or artistic, but Maslow
said that he found transcendent individuals amongst creative people in a wide variety of vocations (including business, managers, educators, and politicians), though there are not many of them in any eld.
Transcendence, according to Maslow, is the very highest and most holistic level of human consciousness,
which involves relating to oneself, to all others, to all species, to nature, and to the cosmos as an end rather
than as a means (Maslow, 1971).

It is essential that individuals not be reduced to the role they play in

relation to others, transcendence can only be found within oneself (Maslow, 1964, 1968). Maslow's idea is
certainly not new.

Ancient teachings in Yoga tell us that there is a single universal spirit that connects

us all, and Buddhists describe this connection as

interbeing. The Abrahamic religions teach us that the

entire universe was created by, and therefore is connected through, one god.

It was Maslow's hope that

a transcendent Fourth Force in psychology would help all people to become self-actualizing. In Buddhist
terms, Maslow was advocating the intentional creation of psychological Bodhisattvas. Perhaps this is what
Maslow meant by the term metacounselor.

Connections Across Cultures: Is Nothing Sacred?
Maslow described some lofty ambitions for humanity in

Farther Reaches of Human Nature

Toward a Psychology of Being

(1968) and

The

(1971), as well as some challenges we face along the way. Transcendence,

according to Maslow, is a loss of our sense of Self, as we begin to feel an intimate connection with the
world around us and all other people. But transcendence is exceedingly dicult when we are hindered by
the defense mechanism of desacralization.

What exactly does the word sacred mean?

It is not easily

found in psychological works. William James often wrote about spiritual matters, but not about what is
or is not sacred. Sigmund Freud mentioned sacred prohibitions in his nal book,

Moses and Monotheism

(Freud, 1939/1967), but he felt that anything sacred was simply a cultural adaptation of all children's
fear of challenging their father's will (and God was created as a symbol of the mythological father).

A

dictionary denition of sacred says that it is connected with God (or the gods) or dedicated to a religious
purpose and so deserving veneration. However, there is another denition that does not require a religious
context:

regarded with great respect and reverence by a particular religion, group, or individual (The

Oxford American College Dictionary, 2002). Maslow described desacralization as a rejection of the values
and virtues of one's parents.

As a result, people grow up without the ability to see anything as sacred,

eternal, or symbolic. In other words, they grow up without meaning in their lives.
The process of resacralization, which Maslow considered an essential task of therapists working with
clients who seek help in this critical area of their life, requires that we have some concept of what is sacred.
So, what is sacred? Many answers can be found, but there does seem to be at least one common thread.
Christians have long believed that forgiveness lies at the heart of faith. Psychologists have recently found
that forgiveness may also lie at the heart of emotional and physical well-being.

David Myers & Malcolm Jeeves (2003)
. . .Compassion is the wish that others be

free of suering. It is by means of compassion that we aspire

to attain enlightenment. It is compassion that inspires us to engage in the virtuous practices that lead to
Buddhahood. We must therefore devote ourselves to developing compassion.

The Dalai Lama (2001)
I have been engaged in peace work for more than thirty years: combating poverty, ignorance, and disease;
going to sea to help rescue boat people; evacuating the wounded from combat zones; resettling refugees;
helping hungry children and orphans; opposing wars; producing and disseminating peace literature; training
peace and social workers; and rebuilding villages destroyed by bombs.

It is because of the practice of

meditation - stopping, calming, and looking deeply - that I have been able to nourish and protect the
sources of my spiritual energy and continue this work.

Forgiveness is a letting go of past suering and betrayal, a release of the burden of pain and hate that
we carry.
Forgiveness honors the heart's greatest dignity. Whenever we are lost, it brings us back to the ground of
love.

And he said to him, You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and
with all your mind. This is the great and rst commandment. And a second is like it, You shall love your

Jesus Christ

(The Holy Bible, 1962)

In examining self-actualizing people directly, I nd that in all cases, at least in our culture, they are dedicated people, devoted to some task outside themselves, some vocation, or duty, or beloved job. Generally
the devotion and dedication is so marked that one can fairly use the old words vocation, calling, or mission
to describe their passionate, seless, and profound feeling for their work.
The spiritual life is then part of the human essence.

It is a dening-characteristic of human nature,

without which human nature is not full human nature. It is part of the Real Self, of one's identity, of one's
inner core, of one's specieshood, of full humanness.

Abraham Maslow (1971)
Christians, Buddhists, Muslims, as well as members of other religions and humanists, all have some
variation of what has been called

The Golden Rule :

treating others as you would like to be treated. If that

is sacred, then even amongst atheists, young people can evaluate the values and virtues of their parents,
community, and culture, and then decide whether those values are right or wrong, whether they want to
perpetuate an aspect of that society based on their own thoughts and feelings about how they, themselves,
may be treated someday by others. This resacralization need not be religious or spiritual, but it commonly
is, and some psychologists are comfortable embracing spirituality as such.
Kenneth Pargament and Annette Mahoney (2005) wrote a chapter entitled Spirituality: Discovering and
Conserving the Sacred, which was included in the Handbook of Positive Psychology (Snyder & Lopez, 2005).
First, they point out that religion is an undeniable fact in American society. Some 95 percent of Americans
believe in God, and 86 percent believe that He can be reached through prayer and that He is important
or very important to them.

Spirituality, according to Pargament and Mahoney, is the process in which

individuals seek both to discover and to conserve that which is sacred. It is interesting to note that Maslow
and Rogers consider self-actualization and transcendence to be a process as well, not something that one can
get and keep permanently. An important aspect of dening what is sacred is that it is imbued with divinity.
God may be seen as manifest in marriage, work can be seen as a vocation to which the person is called, the
environment can been seen as God's creation. In each of these situations, and in others, what is viewed as
sacred has been sanctied by those who consider it sacred. Unfortunately, this can have negative results as
well, such as when the Heaven's Gate cult followed their sanctied leader to their deaths. Thus, spirituality
is not necessarily synonymous with a good and healthy lifestyle.
Still, there is research that has shown that couples who sanctify their marriage experience greater marital
satisfaction, less marital conict, and more eective marital problem-solving strategies. Likewise, mothers
and fathers who sanctify the role of parenting report less aggression and more consistent discipline in raising
their children. For college students, spiritual striving was more highly correlated with well-being than any
other form of goal-setting (see Pargament & Mahoney, 2005).

So there appear to be real psychological

advantages to spiritual pursuits. This may be particularly true during challenging times in our lives:

illnesses, and death are immutable elements of existence.

Try as we might to aect these elements, a

signicant portion of our lives remains beyond our immediate control. In spirituality, however, we can nd
ways to understand and deal with our fundamental human insuciency, the fact that there are limits to our
control. . . (pg. 655; Pargament & Mahoney, 2005)

Eupsychian Management and Theory Z
It is not merely a coincidence that Maslow is well-known in the eld of business. He spent 3 years as the
plant manager for the Maslow Cooperage Corporation, and later he spent a summer studying at an electronics
rm in California (Non-Linear Systems, Inc.) at the invitation of the company's president. He became very
interested in industrial and managerial psychology, and the journal he kept in California was published
as

Eupsychian Management

(Maslow, 1965).

Eupsychia refers to real possibility and improvability, and a

movement toward psychological health, as opposed to the vague fantasies of proposed Utopian societies. More
precisely, though this is something of a fantasy itself, Maslow described Eupsychia as the culture that would
arise if 1,000 self-actualizing people were allowed to live their own lives on a sheltered island somewhere.
Maslow applied his psychological theories, including both the hierarchy of needs and self-actualization, to a
management style that takes advantage of this knowledge to maximize the potential of the employees in a
company (also see the collection of Maslow's unpublished papers by Homan, 1996).
Maslow introduced a variety of terms related to his theories on management, one of the most interesting
being

synergy. Having borrowed the term from Ruth Benedict, synergy refers to a situation in which a

person pursuing their own, selsh goals is automatically helping others, and a person unselshly helping
others is, at the same time, helping themselves. According to Maslow, when selshness and unselshness
are mutually exclusive, it is a sign of mild psychopathology.

Self-actualizing individuals are above the

distinction between selshness and unselshness; they enjoy seeing others experience pleasure.

Maslow

oered the personal example of feeding strawberries to his little daughter. As the child smacked her lips and
thoroughly loved the strawberries, an experience that thrilled Maslow, what was he actually giving up by
letting her eat the strawberries instead of eating them himself ? In his experience with the Blackfoot tribe,
a member named Teddy was able to buy a car. He was the only one who had one, but tradition allowed
anyone in the tribe to borrow it. Teddy used his car no more often than anyone else, but he had to pay the
bills, including the gas bill. And yet, everyone in the tribe was so proud of him that he was greatly admired
and they elected him chief. So, he beneted in other ways by following tradition and letting everyone use
his car (Maslow, 1965). In the business eld, when managers encourage cooperation and communication,
everyone benets from the healthy growth and continuous improvement of the company. And this leads us
to

Theory Z (which is Eupsychian management).
Douglas McGregor, a professor of industrial relations at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was

greatly impressed with Maslow's work, and McGregor had used

Motivation and Personality

as a textbook in

his business classes. Based on Maslow's theories, McGregor published a book in 1960 in which he outlined
two managerial models,

Theory X and Theory Y (Gabor, 2000; Homan, 1996). Maslow described the

two theories as follows:

. . .To put it succinctly, Theory Y

assumes that if you give people responsibilities and freedom, then they

will like to work and will do a better job.

Theory Y also assumes that workers basically like excellence,

eciency, perfection, and the like.

Theory X,

which still dominates most of the world's workplace, has a contrasting view. It assumes that

people are basically stupid, lazy, hurtful, and untrustworthy and, therefore, that you have got to check
everything constantly because workers will steal you blind if you don't. (pg. 187; Maslow, 1996a)
The Theory X/Theory Y strategy was intentionally put into practice at Non-Linear Systems, hence
Maslow's invitation to study there. Maslow concluded, however, that even Theory Y did not go far enough
in maximizing people's potential.

People have metaneeds(the need for B-values), needs that go beyond

simply oering higher salaries. When employees have their basic needs met, but recognize ineciency and
mismanagement in the company, they will still complain, but these higher level complaints can now be
described as

metagrumbles (as opposed to the lower level grumbles about lower level needs). Theory

Z attempts to transcend Theory Y and actively facilitate the growth of a company's employees toward
self-actualization (Homan, 1996; Maslow, 1971; Maslow 1996b).

Discussion Question: How's your job (or any job you have had)? Would you describe your supervisor

Henry Murray and Personology
Henry Murray was primarily psychodynamic in his orientation. However, the fundamental aspect of his
theory is the presence of needs in our lives, and there was a distinctly humanistic aspect to his theories as
well (Maddi & Costa, 1972). Thus, it seems appropriate to include Murray alongside Maslow's discussion

Thematic
Apperception Test (or TAT), for screening candidates for special work assignments. Once again, this
of human needs. In addition, Murray developed a practical application of his famous test, the

is similar to Maslow's forays into the eld of industrial/organizational psychology. Although it is common
to present dierent elds as fundamentally opposed, such as humanistic psychology

vs. psychodynamic

psychology, Murray and Maslow provide an ideal opportunity to see the commonalities that often exist
between dierent areas in psychology. It must also be remembered that Murray was no strict adherent to
the dogmatic view of psychoanalysis presented by Freud:

. . .psychoanalysis

stands for a conceptual system which explains, it seems to me, as much as any other.

But this is no reason for going in blind and swallowing the whole indigestible bolus, cannibalistically devouring
the totem father in the hope of acquiring his genius, his authoritative dominance, and thus rising to power
in the psychoanalytic society, that battle-ground of Little Corporals. No; I, for one, prefer to take what I
please, suspend judgment, reject what I please, speak freely. (pg. 31; Murray, 1940/2008).

Brief Biography of Henry Murray
Henry Alexander Murray, Jr.

was born in 1893 in New York City.

typically asked his friends to call him Harry.

He had many nicknames, and

His family was quite wealthy, and had a noble history.

He

was a descendant of John Murray, the fourth Earl of Dunmore, the last Royal Governor of Virginia, and
his mother's great-grandfather, Colonel Harry Babcock, had served on General George Washington's sta
during the Revolutionary War.

Murray lived a life of luxury, spending the summers on Long Island and

often traveling throughout Europe. He was educated at exclusive private schools. However, his childhood
was not without challenges. He felt abandoned by his mother, who suered from depression much of her life,
when Murray was quite young. He stuttered, and was cross-eyed. The operation to help cure his internal
strabismus accidentally left him with an external strabismus.

This created problems for Murray when it

came to competing in athletics, but Murray worked hard to overcome his diculties and he excelled at
sports. He became the quarterback of his football team and won a featherweight boxing championship at
school. In college, he made the rowing team at Harvard University (Maddi & Costa, 1972; Robinson, 1992).
In spite of his athletic success at Harvard, or perhaps because of it, he did not do well academically,
receiving below average grades. Nonetheless, he earned a degree in history in 1915. While at Harvard he
also married Josephine Rantoul, after a lengthy courtship. Despite his mediocre grades at Harvard, Murray
was accepted into the Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons, and graduated rst in his class in
1919. He then completed a surgical internship at Presbyterian Hospital in New York, where he once treated
the future president Franklin D. Roosevelt, followed by a period of research at the Rockefeller Institute
for Medical Research and Cambridge University, which culminated in a Ph.D. in biochemistry in 1927. He
then accepted a position as assistant to Morton Prince, and became the director of Harvard University's
psychology clinic.

Murray had never taken a psychology course, but he had some interesting experience

(Maddi & Costa, 1972; Robinson, 1992).
Murray had a psychiatry course in medical school, and had read Freud's

Interpretation of Dreams.

He

also had a research assistant from Vienna, Alma Rosenthal, who had been a long-time friend of Anna Freud.
While both working together and having an intimate love aair, Rosenthal introduced Murray to the deeper
dimensions of the unconscious mind. However, it was Murray's lifelong mistress, Christiana Morgan, who
introduced him to Jung's book

Psychology Types.

Murray was deeply impressed by Jung's book, but even

more by Jung himself. Murray was troubled by the intense love aair he had developed with Morgan, so
he went to Zurich in order to be psychoanalyzed by Jung. Jung managed to help Murray understand his
stuttering and accept having his aair with Morgan. After all, Jung had maintained a mistress of his own for
many years. Jung also managed to convince Murray's wife and Morgan's husband to accept the aair as well,

and Christiana Morgan remained a very important colleague throughout Murray's life. It has been suggested
that she played a far more important role in his theories, and in the development of the TAT, than she has
been given credit for (Maddi & Costa, 1972; Robinson, 1992). Partly because Jung had directly helped him
with a psychological problem, and partly because of the extraordinary range of ideas that Jung was open
to, Murray always spoke highly of Jung (though he believed that Jung tended toward being psychotic, just
as Freud tended toward being neurotic; see Brian, 1995).
Initially, Murray's reappointment as clinic director was challenged by the experimental psychologists
Edwin Boring and Karl Lashley, but he was supported by the clinical psychologists, who were led by Gordon
Allport (Stagner, 1988). As his work continued he was quite productive (it was during this time that he
developed the TAT), and many important clinicians passed through the clinic. Included among them was
Erik Erikson, who came to the clinic after having been psychoanalyzed by Anna Freud in Vienna. Murray
also spent a great deal of time traveling and studying in Europe, and enjoyed a memorable evening with
Sigmund and Anna Freud. As he was preparing to return to the clinic, World War II began. Murray joined
the Army Medical Corps, and eventually worked for the Oce of Strategic Services (OSS). Of particular
interest was his use of the TAT to screen OSS agents for sensitive missions (the OSS was the precursor to the
CIA, so in peacetime these agents would be called spies). He was in China studying errors they had made
in their assessments when the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. Murray was shocked, and devoted
the rest of his life to seeking alternatives to war (Maddi & Costa, 1972; Robinson, 1992).

Distinguished Scientic Contribution
Gold Medal Award from the American Psycho-

As his career and life approached their ends, Murray received the

Award

from the American Psychological Association, and the

logical Foundation. He received numerous honorary degrees, and collections of papers have been published
in his honor (e.g., White, 1963; Zucker, Rabin, Arono, & Frank, 1992). In June, 1988, Murray told his
nurse that he was dead. She disagreed with him, and pinched him gently on the cheek to prove her point.
He curtly disagreed with her, declaring that he was the doctor, she was the nurse, and he was dead. A few
days later he was right (Robinson, 1992).

Placing Murray in Context: A Challenging Task
There does not seem to be a consensus on where Murray ts within the eld of personality theory.
Trained as a Freudian psychoanalyst, he is often grouped with the neo-Freudians.

However, he has also

been placed with the trait theorists, and he was a colleague of Gordon Allport. However, many personality
theory textbooks don't consider Murray worthy of signicant attention. He is included alongside Maslow
in this textbook because his work focused primarily on needs. In addition, the practical application of his
Thematic Apperception Test in screening candidates for OSS assignments was similar to Maslow's application
of psychological principles in the business eld.
The Thematic Apperception Test is certainly Murray's claim to fame. It remains one of the best-known
tests in psychology, having been applied in research, business, and therapeutic settings. Since Murray used
the TAT in combination with the Rorschach Inkblot Test, he maintained his ties to traditional psychoanalysis
and helped to advance the fame of the other renowned projective test. As such, his practical contributions
to psychology seem to outweigh his theoretical contributions.
It has been said that the value of a theory can be measured by the research that follows. David McClelland's use of the TAT to study the need for achievement is a common topic in introductory psychology
textbooks.

Thus, Murray's contributions have inspired classic research in psychology.

That alone should

ensure a place of signicance for Murray in the history of personality theory.

Human Needs
In Explorations in Personality

(Murray, 1938), Murray describes people as today's great problem. What

can we know about someone, and how can we describe it in a way that has clear meaning? Nothing is more
important in the eld of psychology:
The point of view adopted in this book is that personalities constitute the subject matter of psychology,
the life history of a single man being a unit with which this discipline has to deal. . . Our guiding thought
was that personality is a temporal whole and to understand a part of it one must have sense, though vague,
of the totality. (pgs. 3-4; Murray, 1938)
Thus, Murray and his colleagues sought to understand the nature of personality, in order to help them

CHAPTER 8. CARL ROGERS AND ABRAHAM MASLOW

186

understand individuals. He referred to this direct study of personality as

personology, simply because he

considered it clumsy to refer to the psychology of personality instead.
Murray described the very elegant process by which the Harvard Clinic group systematically approached
their studies, and then presented a lengthy series of propositions regarding a theory of personality.
primary focus of these propositions came down to what Murray called a press-need combination. A

The

need,

according to Murray, is a hypothetical process that is imagined to occur in order to account for certain
objective and subjective facts. In other words, when an organism reliably acts in a certain way to obtain
some goal, we can determine that the organism had a need to achieve that goal. Needs are often recognized
only after the fact, the behavior that satises the need may be a blind impulse, but it still leads toward
satisfying the needed goal.

Press is the term Murray applied to environmental objects or situations that

designate directional tendencies, or that guide our needs. Anything in the environment, either harmful or
benecial to the organism, exerts press. Thus, our current needs, in the context of current environmental
press, determine our ongoing behavior (Murray, 1938).
Like Maslow, Murray separated needs into biological and psychology factors based on how essential they

viscerogenic needs, include air, water, food, sex, harm-avoidance,
psychogenic needs, which are presumed to derive from the primary needs, are

were to one's survival. The primary, or
etc.

The secondary or

common reaction systems and wishes. Although Murray organizes the psychogenic needs into groups, they
are not rank-ordered as was Maslow's hierarchy, so we will not consider the groups any further. Individually,
there are a total of twenty-eight human needs (Murray, 1938). A partial list, with denitions, includes the
following:

•
•
•
•
•

Acquisition: the need to gain possessions and property
Retention: the need to retain possession of things, to refuse to give or lend
Order: the need to arrange, organize, put away objects, to be tidy and clean
Construction: the need to build things
Achievement: the need to overcome obstacles, to exercise power, to strive to do something dicult as
well and as quickly as possible

•
•
•
•

Recognition: the need to excite praise and commendation, to demand respect
Exhibition: the need to attract attention to oneself
Defendance: the need to defend oneself against blame or belittlement
Counteraction:

the need to proudly overcome defeat by restriving and retaliating, to defend one's

honor

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Dominance: the need to inuence or control others
Deference: the need to admire and willingly follow a superior
Aggression: the need to assault or injure another, to harm, blame, accuse, or ridicule a person
Abasement: the need to surrender, to comply and accept punishment
Aliation: the need to form friendships and associations, to greet, join, and live with others, to love
Rejection: the need to snub, ignore, or exclude others
Play: the need to relax, amuse oneself, seek diversion and entertainment
Cognizance: the need to explore, to ask questions, to satisfy curiosity

According the Murray, in the course of daily life these needs are often interrelated. When a single action can
satisfy more than one need, we can say that the needs are fused. However, needs can also come into conict.
For example, an individual's need for dominance may make it dicult to satisfy their need for aliation,
unless they can nd someone with a powerful need for abasement. Such a situation is one of the ways in
which psychologists have tried to understand abusive relationships. In other words, when someone with a
strong need for aliation and debasement becomes involved with someone with a strong need for aliation
and dominance (particularly in a pathological sense), the results can be very unfortunate.

Figure 8.4

Anyone who has children is often reminded of their need for playing, and most any setting can provide
an opportunity for play. Here, the author's children are playing cards.
Any object, or person, that evokes a need is said to be cathected by the person being studied. In other
words, they have invested some of their limited psychic energy (libido) into that object. Murray believed
that an individual's personality is revealed by the objects to which that person is attached by the cathexis
of libido, especially if you can recognize the intensity, endurance, and rigidity of the cathexis. This process
not only applies to individuals, but institutions and cultures also have predictable patterns in terms of their
cathected objects.

Put more simply, we can strive to understand individuals, including doing so from a

cross-cultural perspective, by examining the nature and pattern of needs they seek to satisfy in their daily
lives (Murray, 1938).
Morris Stein, who worked with Murray in the OSS and then earned a Ph.D. at the Harvard Clinic,
combined Murray's work on identifying human needs and Jung's concept of psychological types. By looking
at patterns in the rank-order of needs among industrial chemists and Peace Corps volunteers, Stein was
able to divide each group into separate psychological types (Stein, 1963).

For example, there were ve

basic types of industrial chemists: Type A was achievement oriented but still worked well with others; Type
B focused on pleasing others, often at the expense of their own ideas; Type C was achievement oriented,
but more driven and hostile than Type A; Type D was motivated by achievement and aliation, but with
an emphasis on order that protected them from criticism or blame; and Type E was particularly focused
on relationships marked by cooperation and trust.

As interesting as these types may be, they are quite

dierent than the personality types identied amongst the Peace Corps volunteers (Stein, 1963).

Thus,

although Stein's investigation suggests that personality types can be identied based on patterns of need,
this approach probably would not provide a general theory of personology that could be applied to anyone.

Discussion Question: Consider Murray's list of psychogenic needs. Which needs are the ones that
aect you the most? Are you able to fulll those needs?

The TAT and the OSS
Murray is typically credited with the development the TAT. However, the original article has Christiana
Morgan as the rst author (Morgan & Murray, 1935), and in
work is described by Morgan (Murray, 1938).

Explorations in Personality

1943, Murray did most of the revision, partly because Morgan was quite ill at the time. The TAT consists of
a series of pictures depicting potentially dramatic events (although the pictures are actually rather vague).
The person taking the test is asked to provide a story that relates events preceding the picture to some nal
outcome of the situation. It is expected that the subject will project their own thoughts and feelings into
the picture as they create their story. In order for this to be possible, Morgan and Murray made sure that
in most pictures there was at least one person with whom the subject could easily empathize and identify
themselves. The TAT became one of the most popular projective tests ever developed, and continues to be
widely used today.
The TAT has been used in two particularly interesting settings outside of clinical psychology: to study the
need for achievement (see the next section), and to screen agents for the Oce of Strategic Services during
World War II. Murray used the TAT as part of a program to help select members of the OSS for critical,
dangerous missions. Even before joining the OSS, Murray worked for the government in support of the war
eort. In conjunction with Gordon Allport, he provided an analysis of the personality of Adolf Hitler, along
with predictions as to how Hitler might react after Germany was defeated. He also helped to develop a series
of questions for the crew of a captured German U-boat. The OSS program involved assessing candidate's
responses to highly stressful situations. In addition to psychological testing, using instruments such as the
TAT, the candidates were put into highly stressful situations. For example, they were told to pick two men
to help them put together a ve-foot cube with wooden poles, blocks, and pegs. However, the available men
were all secretly on Murray's sta. One of them would act helpless and passive, whereas the other made
stupid suggestions and constantly criticized the recruit. The task was, of course, never completed, but it
provided Murray with the information he needed on how the candidate performed under stress (Brian, 1995;
Robinson, 1992).
In the next chapter we will see that the existential psychologist Rollo May talked about our need for
myths, in order to make sense out of our often senseless world. Although this was not a need included by
Murray, he did have an interest in mythology. The imagination that is necessary to create a story around a
picture in the TAT often involves symbolism that arises from the depths of the whole self (Murray, 1960). In
this regard, Murray sounds quite similar to Jung and his theory of archetypes, and Murray discussed some
classic images from our historical mythology. Of particular interest to Murray, however, is whether or not we
will establish new myths in the future. There are older myths that remain oriented to our future, such as the
apocalyptic myths or the myth of the Promised Land (Murray, 1960). The existential philosopher Jean-Paul
Sartre lamented the demythologizing of the universe by science, and he advocated a remythologizing of the
self (see McAdams, 1992). Given that Murray did include a need for cognizance, the need to explore, to ask
questions, and to satisfy curiosity, perhaps there will be new myths created in our future. If so, psychologists
will need to keep current with the cultural phenomena that inuence people's unconscious projections onto
the TAT and other projective tests.

David McClelland and the Need for Achievement
David McClelland, who joined the faculty of Harvard University a few years before Murray retired,
conducted some well-known research utilizing the TAT to examine the

need for achievement. The research

began shortly after World War II, and was supported by the Oce of Naval Research. McClelland and his
colleagues made an interesting point, in the preface to their book

The Achievement Motive

(McClelland,

Atkinson, Clark, & Lowell, 1953), about studying just one of Murray's needs: concentration on a limited
research problem is not necessarily narrowing; it may lead ultimately into the whole of psychology. Indeed,
they felt that they learned a great deal about personality by studying one of the most important of human
needs.
McClelland and his colleagues used the TAT and borrowed heavily from Murray's procedures and scoring
system.

However, they made a number of modications.

They used additional pictures of their own,

they often presented the pictures on a screen to a group of subjects, those subjects were all male college
students, and some of their experimental conditions were designed to evoke achievement-oriented responses,
or responses based on success or failure. An important aspect of this study was that the TAT (and similar
pictures developed by McClelland) requires writing imaginative stories of what the subject projects onto the
picture. Therefore, situations that stimulate achievement-oriented imagination can result in higher scores

189

on the need for achievement, something that McClelland and his colleagues conrmed in Navaho children
during the course of their research (suggesting it is a universal phenomenon).

Overall, they found that

individuals who are high in their need for achievement perform more tasks during timed tests, improve more
quickly in their ability to perform those tasks, set higher levels of aspirations, remember more of the tasks
they failed to perform, and they are more future-oriented and recognize achievement-oriented situations
(McClelland et al., 1953). In addition, they found a positive correlation between the need for achievement
and cultures and families in which there is an emphasis on the individual development of children, with
early childhood being of particular importance. After examining eight Native American cultures (Navaho,
Ciricahua-Apache, Western Apache, Hopi, Comanche, Sanpoil, Paiute, and Flatheads), McClelland and
his colleagues determined that the need for achievement in each culture (measured from classic legends
involving the archetypal trickster coyote) correlates highly with both an early age onset and the severity
of independence training (McClelland et al., 1953). In summary, the need for achievement is a motivational
force that develops in early childhood, and which pushes individuals toward accomplishing life's tasks.
An excellent essay on the need for achievement, which addresses some of the criticism this concept has
endured, was written by McClelland in a new introduction for the second printing of his book

Society

The Achieving

(McClelland, 1976). This book also adds to the cross-cultural reach of McClelland's work, since as

he extends his theory on the need for achievement to the societies in which individuals live he also extends
his theory to other societies around the world. First, the concept itself has typically been misunderstood:

. . .the

word achievement cues all sorts of surplus meanings that the technically dened

n

Achievement

variable does not have. It refers specically to the desire to do something better, faster, more eciently,
with less eort. It is not a generalized desire to succeed. . . (pg. A; McClelland, 1976)
In studying the role of need for achievement within societies, McClelland focused on business and economic
development as one of the most easily compared aspects of dierent cultures. He believed that nations possess
something like a group mind, which can lead the nation in certain directions. Again using literary sources
as examples of cultural perspectives on the need for achievement, McClelland found support for his theory
that high need for achievement preceded dramatic societal development in ancient Greece, pre-Incan Peru,
Spain in the late middle ages, England leading up to the industrial revolution, and during the development
of the United States (particularly in the 1800s). Once again, McClelland cautions against over-generalizing
the meaning of need for achievement:
It is a very specic, rather rare, drive which focuses on the goal of eciency and which expresses itself
in activities available in the culture which permit or encourage one to be more ecient; and across cultures
the most common form such activity takes is business. (pg. B; McClelland, 1976)
The question of where the need for achievement comes from continued to perplex McClelland. Although
early childhood appears to be when a lasting need for achievement develops, the need for achievement can
be enhanced in adults through training seminars. More importantly, however, is the question of where need
for achievement comes from in the rst place, how does it develop within a society?

When McClelland

was working in Ethiopia with the Peace Corps, he studied the Gurage. This small tribal group was treated
with disdain by both the dominant Christian Amhara and the Muslim Galla tribes. And yet the Gurage
were recognized for their clever business strategies, and their children wrote stories lled with imagery
indicative of a high need for achievement. Since the Gurage had developed without contact with Western
Christian, Muslim, or Greco-Roman cultures, they seemed to have developed their own need for achievement.
Unfortunately, so little is known about their history, that McClelland was unable to identify the source of
their motivation (McClelland, 1976).
In support of the contention that studying the need for achievement could provide insights into many
aspects of personality, McClelland pursued a number of interesting topics throughout his career, including
how societies can motivate economic growth and identify talent (McClelland, Baldwin, Bronfenbrenner, &
Strodtbeck, 1958; McClelland & Winter, 1969), the power motive (McClelland, 1975), the development of
social maturity and values (McClelland, 1982a; McClelland, 1982b), and a cross-cultural study on the role
of alcohol in society (McClelland, Davis, Kalin, & Wanner, 1972).
McClelland also wrote a book entitled

We will examine Kabbalah, as well as Christian and Islamic mysticism, as a positive approach to one's lifestyle
in Chapter 18.

A Final Note: Humanistic or Existential?
In this chapter we have examined the humanistic theories of Carl Rogers and Abraham Maslow. In the
next chapter we will examine the existential theories of Viktor Frankl and Rollo May. What really is the
dierence? The distinction is subtle, based on denition, and may seem nonexistent at rst glance. Indeed,
both the humanistic and existential theorists have been inuenced by the likes of Adler, Horney, Fromm,
and Otto Rank, and Rogers in particular often writes about existential choices in his books. Even the cognitive therapist Albert Ellis, himself profoundly inuenced by Adler, considered Rational Emotive Behavior

Humanistic Psychotherapy ; Ellis, 1973). In 1986, the Saybrook
Journal of Humanistic Psychology, under

and the resulting trust that one can place in each person. In other words, we can trust that each person

Although many people make safe, defensive choices, self-

growth choices (Maslow, 1971). Each growth choice moves the person

closer to self-actualization, and the process continues throughout life.
So, consider your own life. Do you feel the actualizing tendency within you? Do you aspire to accomplish
something great, or simply to be a good person in whatever path you choose? Think about your educational
and/or career plans. Think about your life plans, and whether they include a family or special friends. Do
you feel a calling that is pulling in one direction or another? The drive to accomplish, to make a contribution
to your community or society, the belief that you are meant for great things, or simply that you are meant
to be a source of support for others, all of these might be aspects of your actualizing tendency. Or are you
moving through life without a plan, without goals? Do you skate along from day to day, with no destination
in mind?
If you do feel your actualizing tendency, consider how you are living your life. Are you pursuing the steps
necessary to accomplish your goals? Have you made choices, perhaps dicult choices, which have moved
you forward toward those goals?
Basically, do you feel that you are on a path toward self-actualization, and do you think you should be?
Is it reasonable to expect, or hope, that everyone might become self-actualized?
What might it be like to live a fully transcendent, self-actualized life? Although there are many dierent,
and individual, answers to that question, we can nd one example in the remarkable life of Peace Pilgrim
(Friends of Peace Pilgrim, 1982). No one knows her original name, or exactly where or when she was born
(other than it was on a small farm in the Eastern United States in the early 1900s). Her family was poor,
but happy, and she enjoyed her childhood. Her life was fruitful, but eventually she found the world's focus

on self-centeredness and material goods to be unfullling. In 1953, she chose to leave her life behind. She
adopted the name Peace Pilgrim, and began walking across America as a prayer for peace.
A pilgrim is a wanderer with a purpose. . .Mine is for peace, and that is why I am a Peace Pilgrim. . .My
pilgrimage covers the entire peace picture: peace among nations, peace among groups, peace within our
environment, peace among individuals, and the very, very important inner peace - which I talk about most
often because that is where peace begins. . .I have no money. I do not accept any money on my pilgrimage.
I belong to no organization. . .I own only what I wear and carry. There is nothing to tie me down. I am as
free as a bird soaring in the sky.
I walk until given shelter, fast until given food. I don't ask - it's given without asking. Aren't people
good! There is a spark of good in everybody, no matter how deeply it may be buried, it is there. It's waiting
to govern your life gloriously. (pg. 25; Peace Pilgrim cited in Friends of Peace Pilgrim, 1982)
Between 1953 and her death in 1981, she walked, and walked, and walked. By 1964, she had walked 25,000
miles, including walking across the United States twice and through every Canadian province. After that,
she no longer kept track of her mileage, but she completed at least four more pilgrimages, including Alaska,
Hawaii, and a pilgrimage in Mexico. Among the many friends and admirers she met along the way, there
are two notable people (whom psychology students should be familiar with) who provided comments for the
cover of her book: Elisabeth Kubler-Ross called her a wonderful lady, and the popular author/counselor
Wayne Dyer said she is my hero. As for your own life, Peace Pilgrim has some simple advice:
There is no glimpse of the light without walking the path. You can't get it from anyone else, nor can
you give it to anyone. Just take whatever steps seem easiest for you, and as you take a few steps it will be
easier for you to take a few more. (pg. 91; Peace Pilgrim cited in Friends of Peace Pilgrim, 1982).

8.1 Review of Key Points
•

Rogers began his clinical career searching for eective ways of conducting psychotherapy, since the
techniques he had been taught were not providing adequate results.

•

Rogers believed that each person exists in their own, unique experiential eld. Only they can see that
eld clearly, although even they may not perceive it accurately (incongruence).

•

Everyone has an actualizing tendency, according to Rogers.

The term commonly applied to this

tendency is self-actualization.

•

The self is that portion of the experiential eld that is recognized as I or me. It is organized into a
self-structure.

•

Rogers used the term personal power to describe each person's ability to make choices necessary for
the actualization of their self-structure and to then fulll those choices or goals.

•

In order for a person to grow, they must fulll a need for positive regard. This can only come from
receiving unconditional positive regard from important family members and friends (typically beginning
with the parents).

•

When people receive only conditional positive regard, they develop conditions of worth.

Their self-

regard then becomes tied to those conditions of worth.

•

When an individual's self-regard and positive regard are closely related, the person is said to be
congruent. If not, they are said to be incongruent.

•

Congruence and incongruence can be measured by understanding the gap between a person's real self
and their ideal self.

•
•

Rogers described individuals who are congruent and continuing to grow as fully functioning persons.
Relationships can serve to mirror our true personality, and to reveal incongruence we are unaware of
ourselves.

•

Successful marriages, according to Rogers, seem to be based on dedication/commitment, communication, dissolution of roles, and maintaining each person's separate self.

•

Rogers identied six necessary and sucient conditions for positive therapeutic change, conditions that
can exist in any interpersonal relationships (not just in therapy). The key factor in these relationships
may be empathic understanding.

CHAPTER 8. CARL ROGERS AND ABRAHAM MASLOW

•

Rogers extended his study of clinical psychology into other groups designed to help all people grow
and self-actualize, such as T-groups and encounter groups. He described his shift from purely clinical
work to fostering growth in all people as a person-centered approach.

•

Maslow worked with an amazing range of people, from the renowned experimental psychologists Harry
Harlow and Edward Thorndike, to the Gestalt psychologist Max Wertheimer and the personality
theorists/clinicians Alfred Adler, Karen Horney, and Erich Fromm.

•

Values were very important to Maslow in his approach to psychology. He did not, however, advocate
his own values. He reached beyond humanistic psychology to include areas of study such as existential
psychology, existential theology, and Zen Buddhism.

•

Maslow described a hierarchy of needs, as follows: physiological needs, safety needs, belongingness and
love needs, esteem needs, and the need for self-actualization.

Lower needs must be largely satised

before the individual begins to focus on higher needs.

•
•
•

The lower needs can be described as deciency-needs, whereas self-actualization is a Being-need.
In addition to the basic needs, there are also cognitive needs and aesthetic needs.
Maslow described fourteen characteristics of self-actualizing people. He developed his list by studying
both contemporary and historical people who seemed to him to be self-actualizing.

•

Perhaps the best know characteristic of self-actualizing is the peak experience. This experience is often
described in mystical terms, and Maslow believed it may have provided a basis for the creation of
religion in the early history of the human species.

•

Maslow described two defense mechanisms that interfere with the process of self-actualizing: desacralizing and the Jonah complex.

•

Maslow proposed a Fourth Force Psychology based on Being-values and metaneeds. He felt that some
people could suer from a sickness of the soul, a so-called metapathology, and Maslow suggested a
need for metacounselors.

•

Some individuals experience profound peak experiences, which Maslow described as transcendent. His
concept of transcendence seems very close to the Buddhist perspective of interbeing.

•

Maslow proposed that organizations should seek Eupsychia, a realistically attainable environment in
which the actualizing tendency of all the organization's members are supported.

•

When Eupsychian management does support self-actualization, the actualization of each person benets the others around them. The process is known as synergy.

•

Based on a management model that described Theory X and theory Y management styles, Maslow
proposed Theory Z. Theory Z management seeks a transcendent management style that encourages
and maximizes self-actualization and synergy in the work place.

•

Murray based personology on the study of needs. He distinguished between viscerogenic needs and
psychogenic needs.

•

Christiana Morgan and Murray developed the Thematic Apperception Test, a famous projective psychological test. Murray used the test during World War II to select special agents for highly sensitive,
dangerous missions.

•

Murray believed that a person's ability to create a story around a picture in the TAT was based in
large part on their personal mythology. He shared this interest in myth, and its role in psychology,
with Carl Jung and Rollo May.

•

McClelland used the TAT to study the need for achievement. Initially, McClelland considered parental
inuence very important for the development of the achievement need, a nding he conrmed in Native
Americans. However, he found contradictory evidence when he studied the Gurage tribe in Ethiopia.
Thus, he considered the true source of the achievement need as something needing further research.

•

The distinction between humanistic psychology and existential psychology is not clear, and there is
signicant overlap in the thinking of representatives from both elds. In addition, there is a distinct
humanistic element in the psychodynamic theories of Adler, Horney, Fromm, Murray, and others.

Viktor Frankl, Rollo May, and

Existential Psychology

Man is nothing else but what he makes of himself. Such is the rst principle of Existentialism. . .For we mean
that man rst exists, that is, that man rst of all is the being who hurls himself toward a future and who
is conscious of imagining himself as being in the future. . .Thus, Existentialism's rst move is to make every
man aware of what he is and to make the full responsibility of his existence rest on him. (pg. 456; Jean-Paul
Sartre, 1947/1996)

Existential psychology is the area within psychology most closely linked to the eld of philosophy.
Curiously, this provides one of the most common complaints against existential psychology. Many historians
identify the establishment of Wilhelm Wundt's experimental laboratory in Germany in 1879 as the ocial
date of the founding of psychology. Sigmund Freud, with his strong background in biomedical research, also
sought to bring scientic methodology to the study of the mind and mental processes, including psychological
disorders and psychotherapy. Shortly thereafter, Americans such as Edward Thorndike and John Watson
were establishing behaviorism, and its rigorous methodology, as the most inuential eld in American psychology. So, as existential psychology arose in the 1940s and 1950s it was viewed as something of a throwback
to an earlier time when psychology was not distinguished from philosophy (Lundin, 1979).
However, as with those who identify themselves as humanistic psychologists, existential psychologists are
deeply concerned with individuals and the conditions of each unique human life. The detachment that seems
so essential to experimental psychologists is unacceptable to existential psychologists.

The dierence can

easily be seen in the titles of two inuential books written by the leading existential psychologists:

Search for Meaning

by Viktor Frankl (1946/1992) and

Man's Search for Himself

Man's

by Rollo May (1953).

Existential psychology diers signicantly from humanistic psychology, however, in focusing on present
existence and the fear, anguish, and sorrow that are so often associated with the circumstances of our lives
(Lundin, 1979).

9.1 Understanding the Philosophy of Existentialism
The roots of

existentialism as a philosophy began with the Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard (1813-

1855). Kierkegaard was intensely interested in man's relationship with God, and its ultimate impossibility.
Man is nite and individual, whereas God is innite and absolute, so the two can never truly meet.
pursuing the relationship, however, man goes through three stages or modes of existence: the

In

aesthetic

mode, the ethical mode, and the religious mode. The aesthetic mode is concerned with the here and
now, and focuses primarily on pleasure and pain. Young children live primarily in this mode. The ethical
mode involves making choices and wrestling with the concept of responsibility. An individual in the ethical

mode must choose whether or not to live by a code or according to the rules of society. This submission
to rules and codes may prove useful in terms of making life simple, but it is a dead end. In order to break
out of this dead end, one must live in the religious mode by making a rm commitment to do so. While
this may lead to the recognition that each of us is a unique individual, it also brings with it the realization
of our total inadequacy relative to God. As a result, we experience loneliness, anxiety, fear, and dread. All
of this anguish, however, allows us to know what is really true, and for Kierkegaard truth was synonymous
with faith (in God).

However, as important as man's relationship to God was for Kierkegaard, he was

adamantly opposed to organized religion. Kierkegaard rejected objective, so-called

truth in the form of

religious dogma in favor of the subjective truth that each person knows within themselves. While this
subjective, personal truth brings with it the responsibility that leads to anxiety, it can also elevate a person
to an authentic existence (Breisach, 1962; Frost, 1942).
Another philosopher considered essential to the foundation of existentialism was the enigmatic German
philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900). A key element of Nietzsche's philosophy is the

will-to-power.

He believed this will-to-power is the fundamental force in the universe (Alfred Adler considered it fundamental
to personality development).

Ironically, according to Nietzsche, the universe has no regard for humanity.

Natural forces (such as disaster and disease) destroy people, life is extremely dicult, and even those who
struggle on attempting to realize their will eventually succumb to death. There is no hope to be found in an
afterlife, since Nietzsche is famous for declaring that God is dead! Neither is there much hope within society
for many people.

Nietzsche believed that inequality was the natural state of humanity, so he considered

slavery to be perfectly understandable and he felt that women (who are physically weaker than men) should
never expect the same rights as men. Nonetheless, Nietzsche saw a great future for humanity, in the belief,
indeed the faith, that we would create a

superman (or superwoman, as the case may be). It is the creation

of the superman that gives purpose to existence.

Although the concept of the superman helped to fuel

Nazi views on creating a German master race, it also made its way into American comic books as the great
hero Superman (Fritzsche, 2007; Frost, 1942; Jaspers, 1965).

Thus Spoke Zarathustra,

In perhaps Nietzsche's most famous work,

the would-be prophet Zarathustra encouraged people to seek a better future for

humanity:

I will teach you about the superman.

Man is something that should be overcome. What have you done

to overcome him? (pg. 81, Nietzsche, quoted in Fritzsche, 2007)
The German existentialists Martin Heidegger (1889-1976) and Karl Jaspers (1883-1969) focused on human
existence itself and our role in the world. In a sense, Heidegger trivialized the nature of God, equating God
with little more than the greatest being in the world, but a being nonetheless (just as humans are). Jaspers
was not an atheist, but still his existential theory focused on the human journey toward a

freedom that has

meaning only when it reveals itself in union with God (Breisach, 1962; Lescoe, 1974). Heidegger considered
individuals as beings who are all connected in

Being, thus distinguishing between mere beings (including

other animals) and the nature of truth or Being. Only humans are capable of understanding this connection
between all beings, and Heidegger referred to this discovery as

Dasein (being here, or existence). On one

level, Dasein is common to all creatures, but the possibility of being aware of one's connection to Being
is uniquely human.

For those who ask the big questions, Dasein can become authentic existence.

experience comes in the fullness of life, but only if one adopts the mode of existence known as

This

being-in-

the-world. Heidegger insisted that Dasein and being-in-the-world are equal. Being-in-the-world is an odd
concept, however, since Heidegger believed that Being can only arise from nothingness, and so we ourselves
arise as

being-thrown-into-this-world. Having been thrown into this mysterious world we wish to make

it our own, but our desire for connection with Being leads to anxiety.

This anxiety cannot be overcome,

because we are aware that we will die! Surprisingly, however, Heidegger considers death to be something
positive.

It is only because we are going to die that some of us strive to experience life fully.

If we can

accept that death will come, and nothing will follow, we can be true to ourselves and live an authentic life
(Breisach, 1962; Lundin, 1979).
Finally we come to the French existentialist Jean-Paul Sartre (1905-1980). Sartre was an extraordinary
author and one of the most important philosophers of the twentieth century.

carried existential philosophy directly into psychology, with books such as

The Transcendence of the Ego
Being and

(Sartre, 1937/1957) and a section entitled Existential Psychoanalysis in his extraordinary work

Nothingness

(Sartre, 1943). Whereas Kierkegaard believed that man could never truly be one with God, and

Heidegger trivialized God, Sartre simply stated that God does not exist. But this is not inconsequential:
The Existentialist, on the contrary, thinks it very distressing that God does not exist, because all possibility of nding values in a heaven of ideas disappears along with Him; there can no longer be an

a priori

Good, since there is no innite and perfect consciousness to think it. (pg. 459; Sartre, 1947/1996).
If one looks at the title of Sartre's most famous philosophical work,

Being and Nothingness (Sartre, 1943),

you might get the impression that Sartre followed in the footsteps of Heidegger. However, Sartre did not
agree with Heidegger (see Sartre, 1943). Sartre divided the world into

en-soi (the in-itself ) and pour-soi

(the for-itself ). Pour-soi can be dened as conscious beings, of which there is only one kind: human beings.
Everything else is en-soi, things (including non-human animals) that are silent and dead, and from which
come no meaning, they only are (Breisach, 1962).

For Sartre, there is no mystery, no Being, tying all of

creation together. Man's consciousness is not a connection to God that can be realized, it is simply a unique
characteristic of the human species. The nothingness to which Sartre refers is a shell around the pour-soi, the
individual, which separates it from the en-soi. People who try to deny living authentically, those who try to
deny the responsibility that comes with being conscious and settle into being nothing more than en-soi will
have a shattering experience and be totally destroyed (since there is no Being, as described by Heidegger,
beyond the shell surrounding the pour-soi; Breisach, 1962). This establishes critical ethical implications for
the individual, since their life will be what they make of it, and nothing more.
Unfortunately, many people do reject their unique consciousness and desire to be en-soi, just letting life
happen around them.

As the en-soi closes in around them, they begin to experience nausea, forlornness,

anxiety, and despair. Herein lays the need for

existential psychoanalysis:

Existential psychoanalysis is going to reveal to man the real goal of his pursuit, which is being as a
synthetic fusion of the in-itself with the for-itself; existential psychoanalysis is going to acquaint man with
his passion. . .Many men, in fact, know that the goal of their pursuit is being; and

...

they refrain from

appropriating things for their own sake and try to realize the symbolic appropriations of their being-initself. . .existential psychoanalysis. . .must reveal to the moral agent that he is

exist.

the being by whom values

It is then that his freedom will become conscious of itself. . . (pg. 797; Sartre, 1943)

Sartre proposed that individuals become conscious, and through that consciousness create the world itself,
but also that we are condemned to despair and doomed to failure when we realize that all human activities
are merely equivalent. This philosophical approach leads into Sartre's criticism of the psychology of his time.
Sartre believed that psychologists, and even most philosophers, stopped short of really understanding people:
For most philosophers the ego is an inhabitant of consciousness...Others - psychologists for the most
part - claim to discover its material presence, as the center of desires and acts, in each moment of our psychic
life. We should like to show here that the ego is neither formally nor materially

in the world.

in consciousness:

it is outside,

It is a being of the world, like the ego of another. (pg. 31; Sartre, 1937/1957)

So, Sartre believed that an existential psychoanalysis was needed to go beyond the limits of Freudian
psychoanalysis.

It is not enough, according to Sartre, to stop at describing mere patterns of desires and

tendencies (Sartre, 1943). In critiquing the psychoanalytic biography of a famous author named Flaubert,
Sartre asked very meaningful questions about this individual's life: why did Flaubert become a writer instead of a painter, why did he come to feel exalted and self-important instead of gloomy, why did his writing
emphasize violence, or amorous adventures, etc.? Sartre's point is a common criticism of Freudian psychoanalytic theory. If most any result can come from an individual's experiences, then what does psychoanalysis
really tell us about anyone? Sartre proposed a deeper form of psychoanalysis:
This comparison allows us to understand better what an existential psychoanalysis must be if it is entitled
to exist. It is a method destined to bring to light, in a strictly objective form, the subjective choice by which

1943)

Placing Existential Psychology in Context: Height Psychology
Goes Deeper Than Depth Psychology
The two theorists highlighted in this chapter were truly extraordinary individuals. Both Viktor Frankl
(who coined the term height psychology) and Rollo May were well immersed in existential thought and
its application to psychology when they faced seemingly certain death.
in the Nazi concentration camps, death was expected.

For Frankl, who was imprisoned

For May, who was conned to a sanitarium with

tuberculosis, death was a very real possibility (and indeed many died there).

But Frankl and May were

intelligent, observant, and thoughtful men. They watched as many died, while some lived, and they sought
answers that might explain who was destined for each group. Both men observed that for those who resigned
themselves to death, death came soon. But for those who chose to live, they had a real chance to survive
despite the terrible conditions in which they existed.
Frankl and May also shared their training in traditional psychoanalysis, and both had studied with Alfred
Adler, at least somewhat. However, they found the so-called depth psychology as lacking, since it did not
address the true potential for humans to rise above their conditions. In this regard, existential psychologists
have typically been viewed as belonging within the humanistic psychology camp. However, both Frankl and
May considered humanistic psychology to also be lacking, in that it neglected the true potential for humans
to make bad choices, and to harm both themselves and others. So for existential psychologists, the center of
their focus is on the immediate existence of the individual, in the context of their relationship to others. It
is this seeming paradox, and the drive to resolve it, that provides the motivation and energy for life.
There is also a natural connection between existentialism and Eastern schools of thought, including yoga,
Buddhism, and Taoism. Some of the comparisons are so striking that, shortly after discussing Taoism, May
wrote one gets the same shock of similarity in Zen Buddhism (May, 1983). And so, this chapter should
provide an interesting transition to the nal section of this text, in which we will examine both Eastern and
Western spiritual approaches to making positive choices in one's life.

by Sigmund Freud; his second paper was published at the urging of Alfred Adler.

(Frankl, 1946/1992) published in English,

a book that went on to be recognized by the Library of Congress as one of the ten most inuential books
in America. He lectured around the world, and received some thirty honorary doctoral degrees in addition
to the medical degree and the Ph.D. he had earned as a student. He was invited to a private audience with
Pope Paul VI, even though Frankl was Jewish. All of this was accomplished in spite of, and partly because
of, the fact that he spent several years in Nazi concentration camps during World War II, camps where his
parents, brother, wife, and millions of other Jews died.

A Brief Biography of Viktor Frankl
Viktor Frankl was born in Vienna, Austria on March 26, 1905. Although his father had been forced to
drop out of medical school for nancial reasons, Gabriel Frankl held a series of positions with the Austrian
government, working primarily with the department of child protection and youth welfare. He instilled in his
son the importance of being intensely rational and having a rm sense of social justice, and Frankl became
something of a perfectionist. Frankl described his mother Elsa as a kindhearted and deeply pious woman,
but during his childhood she often described him as a pest, and she even changed the words of Frankl's
favorite childhood lullaby to include calling him a pest. This may have been due to the fact that Frankl was
often asking questions, so much so that a family friend nicknamed him The Thinker (Frankl, 1995/2000).
From his mother, Frankl inherited a deep emotionality.

One aspect of this emotionality involved a deep

attachment to his childhood home, and he often felt homesick as his responsibilities kept him away. And
those responsibilities began at an early age (Frankl, 1995/2000; Pattakos, 2004).

Even in high school Frankl was developing a keen interest in existential philosophy and psychology. At
the age of 16 he delivered a public lecture On the Meaning of Life and at 18 he wrote his graduation
essay On the Psychology of Philosophical Thought.

Throughout his high school years he maintained a

correspondence with Sigmund Freud (letters that were later destroyed by the Gestapo when Frankl was
deported to his rst concentration camp). When Frankl was just 19, Freud submitted one of Frankl's papers
for publication in the

International Journal of Psychoanalysis, afterward hoping that Frankl would agree and

give his belated consent. Despite having impressed Freud, Frankl himself was already impressed by Alfred
Adler.

Frankl became active in Adler's individual psychology group, and as he began medical school he

was urged by Adler to publish a paper in the

International Journal of Individual Psychology.

It is hard to

imagine that many people could have come into the favor of both Freud and Adler by such a young age, even
before having begun medical school or a career in psychiatry.

Despite Frankl's young age and somewhat

limited experience, the paper published by Adler was dealing with dicult material, specically the border
area that lies between psychotherapy and philosophy, with special attention to the problems of meanings
and values in psychology (Frankl, 1995/2000).

Eventually, however, Frankl fell out of favor with Adler.

Frankl had been impressed with two men, Allers and Schwarz, whose views were at odds with Adler. On
the evening when Allers and Schwarz announced to the society that they could not agree with Adler, Adler
challenged Frankl and a friend to speak up. Frankl chose to do so, and he defended Allers and Schwarz,
believing that a middle ground could be found. Adler never spoke to Frankl again, even when Frankl said
hello in the local coee shop. For a few months Adler had other people suggest to Frankl that he should
quit the society. When Frankl did not, he was expelled by Adler (Frankl, 1995/2000; Pattakos, 2004).
Frankl proceeded to develop his own practice and his own school of psychotherapy, known as

logotherapy

(the therapy of meaning, as in nding meaning in one's life). As early as 1929, Frankl had begun to recognize
three possible ways to nd meaning in life: a deed we do or a work we create; a meaningful human encounter,
particularly one involving

love; and choosing one's attitude in the face of unavoidable suering. Logotherapy

eventually became known as the third school of Viennese psychotherapy, after Freud's psychoanalysis and
Adler's individual psychology.

During the 1930s Frankl did much of his work with suicidal patients and

teenagers. He had extensive talks with Wilhelm Reich in Berlin, who was also involved in youth counseling
by that time. As the 1930s came to an end, and Austria had been taken over by the Nazis, Frankl sought a
visa to emigrate to the United States, which was eventually granted. However, Frankl's parents could not get
a visa, so he chose to remain in Austria with them. He also began work on his rst book, eventually published
in English under the title

The Doctor and the Soul

(Frankl, 1946/1986), which provided the foundation for

logotherapy. He fell in love with Tilly Grosser, and they were married in 1941, the last legal Jewish marriage
in Vienna under the Nazis.
Shortly thereafter, the realities of Nazi Germany overcame what little privilege Frankl had enjoyed as a
doctor at a major hospital. Since it was illegal for Jews to have children, Tilly Frankl was forced to abort
their rst child. Frankl later dedicated

The Unheard Cry for Meaning

To Harry or Marion an unborn child

(Frankl, 1978). Then the entire Frankl family, except for his sister who had gone to Australia, was deported
to the Theresienstadt concentration camp (the same camp from which Anna Freud cared for orphans after
the war). As they marched into the camp with hundreds, perhaps thousands, of other prisoners, his father
tried to calm those who panicked by saying again and again: Be of good cheer, for God is near. Frankl's
parents, his only brother, and his wife Tilly died in the concentration camps. Most tragically, Frankl believed
that his wife died after the war, but before the liberating Allied forces could care for all of the many, many
suering people (Frankl, 1995/2000).
When Frankl was deported, he tried to hide and save his only copy of

The Doctor and the Soul

by sewing

it into the lining of his coat. However, he was forced to trade his good coat for an old one, and the manuscript
was lost. While imprisoned, he managed to obtain a few scraps of paper on which to make notes. Those
notes later helped him to recreate his book, and that goal gave such meaning to his life that he considered
it an important factor in his will to survive the horrors of the concentration camps. It would be dicult
to adequately describe the conditions of the concentration camps, or how they aected the minds of those
imprisoned, especially since the eects were quite varied. Frankl describes those conditions in

for Meaning.

however, might take exception to referring to his book as deep.

Depth psychology was a term used for

psychodynamically-oriented psychology. In 1938 Frankl coined the term

height psychology in order to

supplement, but not replace, depth psychology (Frankl, 1978).
After the war, Frankl's life was nothing less than amazing.

He returned to his home city of Vienna,

married Eleonore Katharina, née Schwindt, and raised a daughter named Gabriele, whose husband and the
Frankl's grandchildren all lived in Vienna.

He lectured around the world, received many honors, wrote

numerous books, all while continuing to practice psychiatry and teach at the University of Vienna, Harvard,
and elsewhere. He had a great interest in humor and in cartooning. Throughout his life, Frankl steadfastly
refused to acknowledge the validity of collective guilt toward the German people. When asked repeatedly
how he could return to Vienna, after all that happened to him and his family, Frankl replied:

. . .I

answered with a counter-question: Who did what to me? There had been a Catholic baroness who

risked her life by hiding my cousin for years in her apartment. There had been a Socialist attorney (Bruno
Pitterman, later vice chancellor of Austria), who knew me only casually and for whom I had never done
anything; and it was he who smuggled some food to me whenever he could. For what reason, then, should I
turn my back on Vienna? (pp. 101-102; Frankl, 1995/2000)
Viktor Frankl died peacefully on September 2, 1997.

He was 92 years old.

During his life, his work

inuenced many people, from the ordinary to the famous and inuential. Viktor Frankl, to be sure, leaves
a profound legacy (pg. 24; Pattakos, 2004).

The Theoretical Basis for Logotherapy
While Frankl was in medical school, he considered specializing in dermatology or obstetrics.

A fel-

low student who was aware of Frankl's wide-ranging interests, however, introduced Frankl to the works of
Kierkegaard. This friend had been reminded of Kierkegaard's emphasis on living an authentic life, and he
urged Frankl to pursue his interest in psychiatry. While still in medical school Frankl delivered a lecture to
the Academic Society for Medical Psychology, of which Frankl was the founding vice-president, and used the
term logotherapy for the rst time (a few years later he rst used the alternative term existential analysis;
Frankl, 1995/2000). The word logos is Greek for meaning, and this third Viennese school of psychotherapy
focuses on the meaning of human existence and man's search for such a meaning. Logotherapy, therefore,
focuses on man's

will-to-meaning, in contrast to Freud's will-to-pleasure (the drive to satisfy the desires
will-to-power (the drive to overcome inferiority and attain

of the id, the pleasure principle) or Adler's

superiority; adopted from Nietzsche) (Frankl, 1946/1986, 1946/1992).
The will-to-meaning is, according to Frankl, the primary source of one's motivation in life. It is not a secondary rationalization of the instinctual drives, and meaning and values are not simply defense mechanisms.
As Frankl eloquently points out:

. . .as for myself,

I would not be willing to live merely for the sake of my defense mechanisms, nor would

I be ready to die merely for the sake of my reaction formations. Man, however, is able to live and even to
die for the sake of his ideals and values! (pg. 105; Frankl, 1946/1992)
This existential frustration can lead to
noogenic neurosis (a neurosis of the mind or, in other words, the specically

Unfortunately, one's search for meaning can be frustrated.
what Frankl identied as a

human dimension). Frankl suggested that when neuroses arise from an individual's inability to nd meaning
in their life, what they need is logotherapy, not psychotherapy. More specically, they need help to nd some
meaning in their life, some reason to be. When reading Frankl's examples of how he helps such people, and
Frankl oers many of these examples in his writings, it seems so simple. But it must be remembered that it
takes a great deal of experience, knowledge, and maturity, as well as an ability to put oneself in another's
shoes, in order to creatively think of how another person can nd meaning in their life. It would be safe to
say that many of us nd it dicult to nd meaning in our own lives, and research has indeed shown that the
will-to-meaning is a signicant concern throughout the world (Frankl, 1946/1992). In order to make sense of
this problem, Frankl has suggested that we should not ask what we expect from life, but rather, we should
understand that life expects something from us:
A colleague, an aged general practitioner, turned to me because he could not come to terms with the loss
of his wife, who had died two years before. His marriage had been very happy, and he was now extremely
depressed. I asked him quite simply: Tell me what would have happened if you had died rst and your wife

199

had survived you? That would have been terrible, he said. How my wife would have suered? Well,
you see, I answered, your wife has been spared that, and it was you who spared her, though of course
you must now pay by surviving and mourning her.

In that very moment his mourning had been given a

meaning - the meaning of a sacrice. (pg. xx; Frankl, 1946/1986)
The latter point brings us back to Frankl's discussion of how one can nd meaning in life:

through

creating a work or doing a deed; by experiencing something or encountering someone, particularly when love
is involved; or by choosing one's attitude toward unavoidable suering. Those of us who have lost someone
dear know how easily it leads to deep suering. Frankl had already written the rst version of

and the Soul

The Doctor

when he entered the Theresienstadt concentration camp, so his views on how one should choose

their attitude toward unavoidable suering were put to a test that no research protocol could ever hope to
achieve! His observations form the basis for much of

Man's Search for Meaning.

Both his observations of

others and his own reactions in this unimaginably horrible and tragic situation are quite fascinating:

. . .as we stumbled on for miles, slipping on icy spots, supporting each other time and again, dragging one
another up and onward, nothing was said, but we both knew: each of was thinking his wife. . .my mind clung
to my wife's image. . .Real or not, her look was then more luminous than the sun. . .A thought transxed me:
for the rst time in my life I saw the truth as it is set into song by so many poets, proclaimed as the nal
wisdom by so many thinkers. The truth - that love is the ultimate and the highest goal to which man can
aspire. Then I grasped the meaning of the greatest secret that human poetry and human thought and belief
have to impart:

. . .One

The salvation of man is through love and in love.

(pp. 48-49; Frankl, 1946/1992)

evening, when we were already resting on the oor of our hut, dead tired, soup bowls in hand,

a fellow prisoner rushed in and asked us to run out to the assembly grounds and see the wonderful sunset.
Standing outside we saw sinister clouds glowing in the west and the whole sky alive with clouds of everchanging shapes and colors, from steel blue to blood red. . .Then, after minutes of moving silence, one prisoner

could be! (pg. 51; Frankl, 1946/1992)
. . .The experiences of camp life show that man does have a choice of action. There were enough examples,
often of a heroic nature, which proved that apathy could be overcome, irritability suppressed. Man can
said to another, How beautiful the world

preserve a vestige of spiritual freedom, of independence of mind, even in such terrible conditions of psychic
and physical stress.
We who lived in concentration camps can remember the men who walked through the huts comforting
others, giving away their last piece of bread. They may have been few in number, but they oer sucient
proof that everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms - to choose
one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way. (pp. 74-75; Frankl, 1946/1992)

Discussion Question: Frankl considered the most important aspect of survival to be the ability to nd
meaning in one's life. Have you found meaning in your life? Are there goals you have that you believe might
add meaning to your life? Do you know anyone personally whose life seems to be lled with meaning, and
if so, how does it appear to aect them?

Logotherapy as a Technique
Unfortunately, as noted by Frankl, not everyone can successfully accomplish the will-to-meaning. Those
who rapidly declined toward death itself had lost the ability to have faith in the future; they could not
identify any goal that provided meaning for their future. Such individual's exist in what Frankl called an
existential vacuum. We have no instincts that tell us what we have to do, fewer and fewer traditions that
tell us what we should do, and we often don't even know what we want to do.
for logotherapy. As a technique, logotherapy relies primarily on

Therein lays the need

paradoxical intention and dereection

(Frankl, 1946/1986, 1946/1992). Paradoxical intention is based on a simple trap in which neurotic individuals
often nd themselves.

When a person thinks about or approaches a situation that provokes a neurotic

symptom, such as fear, the person experiences

anticipatory anxiety. This anticipatory anxiety takes the

form of the symptom, which reinforces their anxiety. And so on. . . In order to help people break out of this
negative cycle, Frankl recommends having them focus intently on the very thing that evokes their symptoms,
even trying to exhibit their symptoms more severely than ever before! As a result, the patient is able to
separate themselves from their own neurosis, and eventually the neurosis loses its potency.
Similar to anticipatory anxiety, people often experience a compulsive inclination to observe themselves,

CHAPTER 9. VIKTOR FRANKL, ROLLO MAY, AND EXISTENTIAL
PSYCHOLOGY

200

resulting in hyper-reection. For example, people who suer from insomnia focus on their eorts to sleep,
or people who cannot enjoy a sexual relationship often focus on their physical, sexual responses. Because of
this intense focus on sleep, or having an orgasm, these very things are unattainable. In dereection, patients
are taught not to pay attention to what they desire. A person who cannot sleep might read in bed, they
will eventually fall asleep. A person who cannot enjoy intimate sexuality could focus on their partner, and
as a result they should experience satisfaction that they did not expect.

In essence, whereas paradoxical

intention teaches the patient to ridicule their symptoms, dereection teaches the patient to ignore his or her
symptoms (Frankl, 1946/1986).

Discussion Question: Logotherapy relies on paradoxical intention and dereection to break the anticipatory anxiety that often leads to failure (and then, more anxiety). Are there situations where you nd
yourself getting anxious or nervous even before the situation begins? What steps, if any, have you taken to
break out of that pattern?

The Search for Ultimate Meaning
Kierkegaard believed that man could never truly be in contact with the innite and absolute God.
Similarly, Frankl talked about a

super-meaning to life, something that goes far deeper than logic. When

Frankl told his daughter that the

good

good

Lord had cured her measles, his daughter reminded him that the

Lord had given her the measles in the rst place. Since children may not benet from the challenges

of suering as adults might, and even adults nd it dicult to nd meaning in truly horrible situations like
the concentration camps of Nazi Germany or the gulags of the former Soviet Union, the meaning of life in
the greater context of human societies is often not readily apparent. But as Frankl says:
This ultimate meaning necessarily exceeds and surpasses the nite intellectual capacities of man; in
logotherapy, we speak in this context of a super-meaning.

What is demanded of man is not, as some

existential philosophers teach, to endure the meaninglessness of life, but rather to bear his incapacity to
grasp its unconditional meaningfulness in rational terms.

Logos

is deeper than logic.

(pg.

122; Frankl,

1946/1992)
In discussing the value of logotherapy, Frankl oered critiques of other popular elds in psychology and
psychiatry.

His most serious critique was of the deterministic nature of psychoanalysis.

Frankl fervently

believed in an individual's freedom to transcend their self and choose to make the best of any situation.
And he had plenty of experience to back up his opinion:  . . .I am a survivor of four camps - concentration
camps, that is - and as such I also bear witness to the unexpected extent to which man is capable of defying
and braving even the worst conditions conceivable (pg.

47; Frankl, 1978).

He did not, however, reject

determinism entirely. Instead, he attributed determinism to the psychological dimension, whereas freedom
exists within the noölogical dimension. He acknowledged Freud and Adler for teaching us to unmask the
neurotic. As for behaviorism, Frankl acknowledged that it helped to demythologize neurosis, by pointing
out that not every psychological problem is due to unconscious forces from early childhood, and he included
Pavlov, Watson, and Skinner as great pioneers.

Still, both psychoanalysis and behaviorism ignore the

essential humanness of the individual.
Despite his emphasis on the individual human, Frankl did not consider logotherapy as belonging within
humanistic psychology (or at least not within what he called pseudo-humanism; Frankl, 1978). He believed
that humanistic psychology focused so much on the humanity of individuals, that they did not quite appreciate the uniqueness of each person. It is not enough to merely encounter another person. In order to be
moved on the personal level there must be an element of love (love for another person, if not a more intimate
and personal love as for a spouse or a child). As we will see below, Rollo May also considered love to be
of great importance to our lives. The emphasis that Frankl placed on love may have something to do with
his deep spirituality. Frankl believed in a spiritual unconscious, separate from the instinctual unconscious
described by Freud (Frankl, 1948/2000). In order for an individual to experience an authentic existence, they
must determine whether a given phenomenon (thoughts, feelings, impulses, etc.) is instinctual or spiritual,
and then freely choose how to behave or respond. Frankl returned to Heidegger's concept of Dasein, living
according to the understanding that one is connected to Being. Although this concept may seem reminiscent
of Jung's collective unconscious, nothing could be further from the truth:

. . .It cannot be emphasized strongly enough that not only is the unconscious neither divine nor omniscient,

201

but above all man's unconscious relation to God is profoundly personal. The unconscious God must not
be mistaken as an impersonal force operant in man.

This understanding was the great mistake to which

C. G. Jung fell prey. Jung must be credited with having discovered distinctly religious elements within the
unconscious. Yet he misplaced this unconscious religiousness of man, failing to locate the unconscious God
in the personal and existential region. Instead, he allotted it to the region of drives and instincts, where
unconscious religiousness no longer remained a matter of choice and decision. According to Jung, something
within me is religious, but it is not I who then is religious; something within me drives me to God, but it is
not I who makes the choice and takes the responsibility. (pg. 70; Frankl, 1948/2000)
According to Frankl, the most human of all human phenomena is the will-to-meaning.
spirituality, seeks a

Religion, or

will-to-ultimate-meaning. Once again, Frankl believed that Freudian psychoanalysis

and Adlerian individual psychology had failed to suciently credit the self-transcendent quality of individuals
who live authentic lives. It is in the study of authentic lives that height psychology, as Frankl called it, can
address the higher aspirations of the human psyche. In other words, beyond seeking pleasure and/or power,
there is man's search for meaning (Frankl, 1948/2000).

Discussion Question: Frankl was a very spiritual man. He talked about super-meaning and a will-toultimate-meaning. Are you a spiritual and/or religious person? If yes, does your faith help to give meaning
to your life?

9.3 Rollo May and Existential Psychology
Rollo May (1909-1994) introduced existentialism to American psychologists, and has remained the best
known proponent of this approach in America. Trained in a fairly traditional format as a psychoanalyst,
May considered the detachment with which psychoanalysts approached their patients as a violation of social
ethics. For example, if a psychoanalyst helps a patient to be the best they can be, and the person happens to
earn their living in an unseemly or criminal way, it hardly seems proper (Stagner, 1988). On the other hand,
who is to decide which values should be preferred in a particular society? In the pursuit of freedom, May
suggested that sometimes individuals might reasonably oppose the standards or morality of their society.
Politics, a wonderful topic for lively debates, is dependent on opposing viewpoints. Only when an individual
lives an authentic life, however, should their opinion be considered valid, and existential psychology seeks to
help individuals live authentic lives.

A Brief Biography of Rollo May
Rollo Reese May was born on April 21, 1909, in Ohio, and grew up in Marine City, Michigan. He attended
Oberlin College in Ohio, graduating in 1930. Having always been interested in art and artistic creativity, he
joined with a small group of artists and traveled to Europe, where they studied the local art of Poland. In
order to remain in Europe, May took a teaching position with the American College at Salonika in Greece.
When not teaching, he traveled widely throughout Greece, Poland, Romania, and Turkey. He attended the
summer school taught by Alfred Adler.

Deeply impressed by Adler (as Frankl had been), he nonetheless

considered Adler's theories overly simplistic and too general. This may well have been due to his awakening
awareness of the tragic side of human life, keeping in mind that much of Europe suered greatly during the
depression between World War I and World War II (Reeves, 1977).
Upon returning to the United States, May worked as a student advisor and the editor of a student
magazine at Michigan State University. In 1936, he enrolled at Union Theological Seminary in New York,
with the intention of asking, and most likely hoping to nd answers to, the ultimate questions about human
life. Despite having no particular desire to become a minister, he did serve in a parish in Montclair, New
Jersey for a while. While at the seminary, he became a lifelong friend of Paul Tillich, a well-known existential
theologian. Tillich, whose classes May regularly attended, introduced May to the works of Kierkegaard and
Heidegger. May also met Kurt Goldstein during this time, and became acquainted with Goldstein's theories
of self-actualization and anxiety as a reaction by organisms to catastrophic events. Regarding his time as a
minister, May reected that the only events which seemed to include an element of reality were the funerals
(Reeves, 1977).
Shortly after graduating from the seminary, May began writing books on counseling and creative living.

CHAPTER 9. VIKTOR FRANKL, ROLLO MAY, AND EXISTENTIAL
PSYCHOLOGY

202

He worked as a counselor at the College of the City of New York, and trained as a psychoanalyst at the
William Alanson White Institute of Psychiatry, Psychoanalysis, and Psychology in New York.

His time

at the training institute overlapped with Harry Stack Sullivan being the president of the William Alanson
White Foundation, and Erich Fromm as a fellow associate.

In 1946, May began a private practice in

psychoanalysis, in 1948 he became a faculty member at the institute, and in 1949 he received the rst Ph.D.
in clinical psychology at Columbia University. His doctoral dissertation was published as

Anxiety

The Meaning of

(May, 1950), a book that heavily cites the work of Freud and Kierkegaard on anxiety, as well as

Fromm, Horney, and Tillich (May, 1950; Reeves, 1977).
Similar to Viktor Frankl, May's life had taken a dramatic turn during this time, an uncontrollable event
that threatened his life: May contracted tuberculosis. At the time, there were no eective treatments for
this contagious disease, many people died from it, and like many others May had to spend several years at
a sanitarium (Saranac Sanitarium in upstate New York). It was during his time in the sanitarium that May
theorized about anxiety and came to one of the most important conclusions in his career. He determined
that although Freud had done a masterful job of characterizing the eects of anxiety on the individual, it
was Kierkegaard who had truly identied what anxiety is: the threat of becoming nothing. From this point
on May could clearly be identied as an existential psychologist. He collaborated with Abraham Maslow,
Carl Rogers, and Gordon Allport to present a symposium on existential psychology, in conjunction with the
1959 annual convention of American Psychological Association, which led to the publication of a book on
the subject (Reeves, 1977).
As May's career continued, he became a supervisory and training analyst at the William Alanson White
Institute, and an adjunct professor of psychology in the graduate school at New York University. He gave a
series of radio talks on existential psychology on a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation show, he served as
a visiting professor at Harvard and Princeton, and he continued writing. His later books include works on
dreams, symbolism, religion, and love. He eventually settled in California, where he died in 1994.

Anxiety
May considered

anxiety to be the underlying cause of nearly every crisis, whether domestic, professional,

economic, or political. He described the world we live in as an age of anxiety. Even though May published

The Meaning of Anxiety

in 1950, it is safe to say that his concerns are even more relevant today, particu-

larly with the advent of the depersonalization of our world due to the computer age (Reeves, 1977). May
considered a wide range of theories on anxiety, including philosophers, neurologists (Kurt Goldstein), and
the major psychodynamic theorists (including Freud, Adler, Jung, Horney, Sullivan, and Fromm). He came
to the conclusion that Freud had done the best job of explaining anxiety, but it was Kierkegaard who best
understood anxiety. May was particularly impressed by Kierkegaard's idea that anxiety must be understood
in the context of an orientation toward freedom. Freedom is the goal of personality development, and although this freedom brings with it anxiety, it is through facing this anxiety that the possibility of freedom
arises (May, 1950). In praise of Kierkegaard, May wrote:

. . .Kierkegaard

is proclaiming that self-strength develops out of the individual's successful confronting

of anxiety-creating experiences; this is the way one becomes educated to maturity as a self. What is amazing
in Kierkegaard is that despite his lack of the tools for interpreting unconscious material - which tools have
been available in their most complete form only since Freud - he so keenly and profoundly anticipated modern
psychoanalytic insight into anxiety; and that at the same time he placed these insights in the broad context
of a poetic and philosophical understanding of human experience. (pg. 45; May, 1950)
In dening anxiety, May distinguished between anxiety and fear, and between normal anxiety and
neurotic anxiety. According to May, anxiety is the apprehension cued o by a threat to some value which
the individual holds essential to his existence as a personality (pg. 191; May, 1950). The threat may be
either physical or psychological, such as facing death from tuberculosis or being imprisoned in a concentration
camp (which, of course, brought the threat of death in addition to the loss of freedom), or the threat may
challenge some other value that the individual identies with their existence or personal identity (such as the
loss of a career, a divorce, a challenge to patriotism in time of war, etc.). What dierentiates anxiety from
fear, is that fear is a reaction to a specic event, whereas anxiety is vague and diuse. For example, during
a robbery you may fear a man with a gun, but in America today many people are anxious about terrorism.

203

No one can tell when or where terrorists may strike, or even whether they will be foreign terrorists (such
as in the World Trade Center attacks) or American terrorists (such as the bombing of the federal building
in Oklahoma City or the D.C. sniper killings). May carefully pointed out that using the terms vague and
diuse to describe anxiety should in no way diminish our understanding of the intensity and painfulness
that anxiety can bring. Therein lies the dierence between normal vs. neurotic anxiety (May, 1950).
Everyone faces challenges in life, but not everyone sees the same challenges as actual threats.

Losing

one's job can be an opportunity to begin a new career, perhaps to go back to school to pursue that new
career.

However, the transition is often dicult, especially when one is used to being the primary wage

earner in the family, and also if the family has to cut back on items they can no longer aord. So anxiety
would be a reasonable reaction. That anxiety is considered normal if it is 1) not disproportionate to the
objective threat, 2) does not involve mechanisms of intrapsychic conict, and 3) does not require defense
mechanisms for its management (May, 1950). Normal anxiety is often overlooked in adults since it is not
particularly intense, especially compared to neurotic anxiety, and it can be managed constructively. It does
not show itself in panic or other dramatic symptoms. Neurotic anxiety is, simply, the opposite of normal
anxiety. It is disproportionate to the objective threat, it does require intrapsychic defense mechanisms, and
it results in neurotic symptoms in spite of those defense mechanisms. It is important to keep in mind that
we should not consider individuals who suer from neurotic anxiety as suering from objective weaknesses,
but rather they suer from inner psychological patterns and conicts that prevent them from using their
powers to cope.
True to his training in psychodynamic theory, May believed that the psychological patterns resulting
in the inability to cope have their origin in childhood, particularly due to poor early relations between the
infant and its parents, since an infant's essential values arise from the security patterns established between
the infant and its caregivers (as in Erikson's rst psychosocial crisis: trust vs. mistrust, see Chapter 7). One
of the most important factors seems to be the infant's subjective interpretation of rejection by its primary
caregiver, and that subjectivity is inuenced by expectations that form later in life (e.g., middle- and upperclass children, who expect more support from their parents, are especially prone to react to rejection with
neurotic anxiety; May, 1950).

Discussion Question: May felt that we must understand anxiety in relation to freedom, or rather, as
the fear that we will lose our freedom. He said that some of this anxiety is normal, and only in extreme cases
does it become neurotic anxiety. What are some of the situations in your life that make you anxious, and
how might they be a threat to your personal freedom? Do you think the level of these anxieties is normal,
or is it severe enough to perhaps be considered neurotic?

Culture, Anxiety, and Hostility
May also addressed the eects of culture on anxiety, and the close interrelationship between anxiety
and

hostility. Culture aects both the kinds and the quantities of anxiety experienced by individuals.

Beyond the essential relationship between infant and caregiver, the determinants of personality that each of
us consider essential to our existence as a personality are largely cultural. Indeed, even the nature of the
infant/caregiver relationship is subject to cultural inuence. The amount of anxiety most people are likely
to experience is determined, in part, by the stability of the culture. For example, if a culture is relatively
stable and unied, there will be less anxiety throughout that culture (May, 1950). Today, however, many
societies are in dramatic ux, due in large part to the powerful trend toward globalization.
As psychologists have begun to examine anxiety in dierent groups around the world, a variety of interesting, and sometimes disturbing, results have been found. Keep in mind, however, that these are generalities,
and do not necessarily apply to each individual within any group. Generally, Asians are more anxious than
Europeans and White Americans, who are more anxious than Black Americans and Africans, and there
may be a neurological basis for these relative anxiety levels (Rushton, 1999). However, when looking at the
specic form of anxiety related to taking academic tests, Black Americans and Chilean students demonstrate higher levels of test anxiety than White Americans (Clawson, Firment, & Trower, 1981; Guida &
Ludlow, 1989). One suggestion for the higher levels of anxiety among Blacks in America is that our society
is much less sociocentric than most African cultures. Thus, Blacks in America, even if they have lived here
for generations, still experience the eects of their displacement from Africa when the culture they carried

with them is at odds with Western cultural expectations (Okeke at al., 1999), and even more so when an
individual seems to be at odds with most members of their own cultural group (Copeland, 2006). Indeed,
the greater the discrepancy between one's individual cultural expectations and the cultural expectations of
the majority of society, the greater the anxiety an individual experiences. This is particularly true during
attempts at intercultural communication (Matsumoto & Juang, 2004). Any subsequent breakdown of intercultural communication, which is more likely during periods of high anxiety, can either lead to or enhance
pre-existing hostility, prejudice, discrimination, and scapegoating (Whitley & Kite, 2006). One important
challenge to intercultural communication in psychology is the need for clinical psychologists to recognize the

hwa-bung (Korea), koro
nervios (Latin America), dhat syndrome (India), susto (Latin America),

growing number of anxiety disorders unique to non-Western cultures, such as:
(Malaysia and Southern China),
and

taijin kyofusho (Japan) (Castillo, 1997).

Culture can inuence individuals in a wide variety of ways. May (1950) used the example of competitive
individual success in the Western world as his main example, which he considered to be

the

dominant goal in

America. There are many negative eects of this competition, including the high incidences of gastric ulcers
and heart disease in our society. Less than a decade later, Freidman and Rosenman (1959) published their
classic study on the relationship between Type A behavior (studied in highly competitive businessmen) and
cardiovascular disease. Subsequent studies have shown that the key component of Type A behavior predictive
of heart disease is hostility, which we will discuss in more detail below (Dembrowski et al., 1985; Lachar,
1993; MacDougal et al., 1985). There has also been a great deal of discussion in our society about media
inuences on body image, the relationship between unreasonable expectations for women to be thin and the
incidence of eating disorders in girls and women, and the repression of female sexuality in many cultures.
Goldenberg (2005) recently presented an existential perspective on the body itself as a threat.

Cultural

beliefs often help to overcome fears of mortality by convincing individuals that they are of greater value than
other, lower animals. However, despite the beliefs of many that only humans have a soul, our body is still a
mortal animal. As a reaction to the anxiety presented by the reality of our mortal body, many people act in a
hostile fashion toward their own bodies, ranging from denying themselves healthy physical relationships with
others (e.g., sexual repression) to outright self-destructive behavior (e.g., anorexia nervosa). The problem
reaches its extreme, however, when one powerful group directs its hostility in an organized fashion toward
another group.
The relationship between anxiety and hostility, according to May, involves a vicious circle. Anxiety gives
rise to hostility, and hostility gives rise to increased anxiety. But which comes rst? May believed that it was
anxiety that underlies hostility, and the evidence can be found in clinical cases involving repressed hostility:
Granted the interrelation between hostility and anxiety, which aect is generally basic? There is ground
for believing that, even though hostility may be the specic aect present in many situations, anxiety is
often present below the hostility. . .For one example, in some of the psychosomatic studies of patients with
hypertension. . .it has been found that the reason the patients repressed their hostility was that they were
anxious and dependent...The hostility would not have to be repressed in the rst place except that the
individual is anxious and fears counter-hostility or alienation. . . (pg. 223; May, 1950)
In Reeves' analysis of May's theory (1977), Reeves discusses one of the most important social issues to
have faced the United States: the civil rights movement of the 1960s. When an individual's sense of selfhood
is challenged by dramatic changes in society, it can be a very painful experience. And one is likely to resent
those responsible for those changes. While it is true that many White people in America supported the civil
rights movement, White people in the Deep South (and elsewhere, of course) turned their anxiety, and its
associated hostility, toward Blacks.

It should not be necessary here to describe the many terrible acts of

violence that followed. Suce it to say that the federal government had to use military troops to intervene
in some of the worst cases.

Today, we face a similar problem in the war on terrorism.

Given the often

unequal and unfair manner in which globalization brings vastly dierent cultures into conict, and the ease
with which so many people can travel the globe, perhaps we should not be surprised at the dramatic level
of terrorism in the world today.

Center in New York City and killed some 3,000 people, the United States has been involved in what has
been called an international war on terrorism. As the war on terrorism developed, it had two main goals: to
capture Osama bin Laden, leader of Al Qaeda and mastermind of the World Trade Center bombings, and to
overthrow Saddam Hussein, the dictator of Iraq (for his alleged role in supporting international terrorism).
To date, this war has lasted

much

longer than World War II, we have spent hundreds of billions of dollars,

and thousands more young American men and women have died ghting in Afghanistan and Iraq. Many
Iraqi and Afghan civilians, as well as additional coalition military personnel, have also died. Saddam Hussein
was removed from power in Iraq; he was also tried, convicted, and executed. It took nearly 10 years, but
Osama bin Laden was nally tracked down and killed in a raid in Pakistan by U.S. Navy Seals. However,
Al Qaeda is still committing acts of terrorism, Iraq is descending once again into bitter sectarian violence
(rising to the level of civil war), and Americans continue to die ghting in Afghanistan as our intended date
for withdrawal slowly draws near (after 13 years!).

One thing that will not be addressed in this section,

because it does not exist, is an easy answer to these problems.
Please allow me to share a little personal history here.

When the Iranian revolution under Ayatollah

Khomeini overthrew the Shah of Iran, and the revolutionaries captured the American embassy in Tehran
and took sixty-six people hostage (fty-two of those hostages were held for well over a year before being
released), I was in the United States Marine Corps Reserve. I received a phone call at 2:00 a.m. on a Friday
morning at my apartment in Cambridge, MA. By midnight, that same day, my reserve unit was in Camp
Lejeune, NC, with full combat gear, ready to go to war in Iran. We spent the weekend preparing, though
President Carter ultimately chose not to send us overseas. Approximately 10 years later, when the rst Gulf
War erupted after Iraq invaded Kuwait, my sister took part in Operation Desert Storm. As an Air Force
nurse, she was sent to England to help prepare a hospital for wounded military personnel being evacuated
from the Middle East (fortunately casualties were minimal). I considered re-enlisting in the Marine Corps
at that time, since I certainly wasn't going to sit at home while my own sister fought for our country and
our allies. Thankfully, that rst Gulf War was brief and, seemingly, simple. So I have followed events in
the Middle East carefully ever since, and when Al Qaeda attacked us in New York, I saw it as the latest
in a continuation of events in my own life since 1979.

For people in the Middle East, however, it was a

continuation of events that have lasted for thousands of years.
What I believe matters most for Americans today is to begin to make an honest eort to understand
terrorism, its causes, its goals, and how best to deal with it around the world.

not one and the same. In an insightful and easily readable

Islam versus Terrorism, Firooz Zadeh (2002) discusses how Islam opposes violence and murder,

especially of innocent women and children. He also attempts to identify what is and is not terrorism, and
in that eort he identies eight types of terrorism: state terrorism, religious terrorism, criminal terrorism,
terrorism by those who are mentally sick, political terrorism, oppositional terrorism, copy cat terrorism,
and victim terrorism. According to Zadeh, the highest cost to society results from state terrorism. When
the United States supports corrupt, terrorist governments in other parts of the world, our credibility as a
nation ghting terrorism is suspect at best. Has this been the case? Yes, and in the worst possible way: we
switch sides as it serves our political and economic interests. The United States helped to train Osama bin
Laden and the Taliban ghters in Afghanistan when we wanted them to ght the Russians. Now we call
them enemies. We provided weapons and training to Saddam Hussein's army when they were ghting the
Iranians, because of the hostages taken in Tehran. Now we have deposed Hussein. We also sold weapons to
Iran, and used the money to help support the Contras (freedom ghters or terrorists, depending on your point
of view) trying to overthrow the leftist Sandinista government of Nicaragua. Zadeh proposes that people in
the Middle East cannot trust the United States, except in one area: our support of Israel. And since other
Middle Eastern countries see Israel as the one obstacle to a Palestinian homeland, they disapprove of that
support. It does not matter whether the actions of the United States were right or wrong, whether they
really were in our best interests or not. What matters is how the rest of the world sees us now, and whether
our top government ocials are willing to consider how we are viewed globally and to act responsibly in
terms of foreign policy in order to ensure what is best for all people around the world. In addressing the
Middle East in particular, Fathali Moghaddam wrote:

Islamic communities in many parts of the world are experiencing a profound and historic identity crisis,
one tragic manifestation of which is terrorism.

In order to understand and avert this destructive trend,

we must come to grips with the monumental crisis of identity that is paralyzing moderate movements but
energizing fanatic forces in Islamic communities.

. . .Why do we need to understand how the terrorists see the world?

Because this is the best way for us to

nd an eective means to end terrorism. . .Seeing the world from the terrorists' point of view does not mean
condoning terrorism; rather, it means better understanding terrorism so as to end it. (pg. ix; Moghaddam,
2006)
As mentioned above, there are many dierent forms of terrorism, so it is dicult to dene exactly what
it is.

Nevertheless, in an eort to do so, Moghaddam (2005) denes terrorism as politically motivated

violence, perpetrated by individuals, groups, or state-sponsored agents, intended to instill feelings of terror
and helplessness in a population in order to inuence decision making and to change behavior. Moghaddam
suggests that psychologists need to play an important role in understanding terrorism for two main reasons:
the basis for terrorist actions is typically subjectively interpreted values and beliefs, and the actions of
terrorists are designed to cause specic psychological experiences, i.e., terror and helplessness. Moghaddam
(2005, 2006) proposes a metaphor for how one becomes a terrorist, based on climbing a staircase, in which
options are perceived to become more and more limited as one climbs the stairs. The most signicant factor
is the condition in which many people live on the ground oor, before they even consider climbing that
staircase. Many people in this world live in abject poverty, under repressive governments that are unjust.
When individuals see no hope within the system, and they lack any political means to eect change, then a
path toward terrorism becomes perhaps the only reasonable possibility. Still, very few people are likely to
become suicide bombers.
Individuals living in desperate conditions may move to the rst oor on the staircase toward terrorism,
where they evaluate their perceived options to ght unfair treatment.

If there appear to be no options

for justice within one's society, no opportunity to be heard, and no opportunity for personal mobility, the
individual may then move to the second oor. Here the individual begins to displace their aggression. This
often involves education/propaganda that identies a clear target, for example the United States, also known
as the Great Satan. This is the important beginning of an us-versus-them mentality. On the third oor,
individuals become morally engaged with the terrorist organization. While we may see terrorists as immoral,
they are beginning to believe that they are ghting for a just cause, against the immoral repression of their
chosen target. As they move to the fourth oor, they solidify their categorical thinking (the us-versus-them
mentality) and begin to see the terrorist organization, and terrorist acts, as legitimate. At this point there
is little chance that they can leave the terrorist organization alive.

For specic individuals, the training

necessary to carry out a terrorist act takes place, often very quickly. Not only does a terrorist need to learn
about weapons and tactics, they must also be trained to sidestep the natural, biological inhibition against
killing other human beings. Two factors in helping to prepare people to kill are the intense indoctrination
in the belief that their actions are for a greater good and secrecy. If an attack is done suddenly and without
warning, victims have no opportunity to submit or to beg for mercy. The act occurs before the terrorist
might become compassionate as he or she faces their intended victims (Moghaddam, 2005, 2006).

Based

on this model, Moghaddam proposes four steps that are necessary to stop terrorism by interrupting the
formation of new terrorists.

First, there must be prevention.

Unfortunately, our government has a long

history of choosing short-term xes, rather than long-term preventative measures. Case in point: America's
failure in the war on drugs. Aggressive responses aimed at individuals only provide an opening for someone
new to step in and continuing using and/or selling drugs, and the same is true of terrorists. We need to
work toward eliminating the pathway to terrorism, so we will not need to use the military and/or FBI to
track down individuals (except, of course, in extreme cases such as terrorism that results from psychological
disorder - e.g., consider the case of Theodore Kaczynski, the Unabomber). In addition, Moghaddam suggests
supporting contextualized democracy, educating against categorical thinking, and promoting interobjectivity
and justice. In order for there to be a long-term solution, there must be international dialogue and improved
intercultural understanding (Moghaddam, 2005).

Islam, let's examine where known terrorist organizations are located around the world.

Fairly notorious

organizations have come from Northern Ireland (e.g., the Irish Republican Army and the Ulster Defense
Association), throughout mainland Europe (e.g., the Red Army Faction in Germany, the Red Brigades in
Italy, and Action Directe in France), throughout the Middle East (e.g., Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Palestinian
group Hamas, the Stern Gang that fought for the establishment of Israel, and Al Qaeda), Africa, Asia, Latin
America, Canada, and the United States (e.g., the Animal Liberation Front, Aryan Nations, the Black
Panthers, and the Ku Klux Klan). As of 1999, at least twenty-eight well-organized terrorist groups existed,
and when one takes into account factions within those groups and smaller, yet still identiable, groups, as
many as eighty-three terrorists groups have been identied around the world (Henderson, 2001). Some are
primarily political, and some are primarily religious. Some are global, and some are more local. They include
people and cultures of great diversity: Black, White, Asian, Latin, Catholic, Protestant, Muslim, Hindu,
etc. Although terrorism appears to arise out of poverty and desperation, terrorists themselves, or at least
the leaders, tend to be better educated than most and they are well versed in propaganda and well trained
in weapons and tactics (Moghaddam, 2005; Zadeh, 2002). The only characteristic that all terrorists seem to
share is an extreme commitment to violence, which arises out of desperation and perceived injustice, and is
viewed as the only means to be heard and to eect change.
So can terrorism eect change, is terrorism eective? One can easily nd authors who argue that it does
indeed work (Dershowitz, 2002) or that it always fails (Carr, 2002). Alan Dershowitz (2002) argues that the
very reason terrorism works is everything we have looked at so far: an eort to understand the root causes
of terrorism and the terrorists themselves. Accordingly, he says:
We must take precisely the opposite approach to terrorism.

to understand or eliminate its alleged root causes,

We must commit ourselves

never to try

but rather to place it beyond the pale of dialogue and

negotiation. Our message must be this: even if you have legitimate grievances, if you resort to terrorism as
a means toward eliminating them we will simply not listen to you, we will not try to understand you, and
we will certainly never change any of our policies toward you. Instead, we will hunt you down and destroy
your capacity to engage in terror. (pp. 24-25; Dershowitz, 2002)
As a case in point, Dershowitz cites the awarding of observer status at the United Nations to the Palestinian Liberation Organization only after Palestinian terrorists began hijacking commercial airliners. Prior to
the hijackings, 20 years of pleading their case to the United Nations had little eect. Dershowitz then oers a
timeline that appears to clearly establish an eective relationship in which terrorism became more and more
eective over time (from 1968-1999) in eliciting international recognition and support for the Palestinian
cause. In contrast, Caleb Carr (2002) views terrorism entirely within the discipline of military history. He
considers today's terrorism to be nothing more than a modern permutation of warfare against civilians in
order to break their support for either leaders or policies that the terrorists oppose, the origins of which are as
old as human conict itself. Viewing terrorism as warfare has certain interesting implications. Throughout
history, those who wage war against civilians ultimately defeated themselves by turning sentiment against
them. On 9/11, Al Qaeda attacked civilians to a degree that has not been seen in ages:

. . .In so doing, the organizers, sponsors, and foot soldiers of every terrorist group involved in the September 11 attacks have unwittingly ensured that their extremist cause will be discredited among many of their
sympathizers, disowned by most of their former sponsors, and nally defeated by their enemies: two thousand years of the lessons of terror dictate that this is the ultimate fate that awaits the attackers, no matter
how many noncombatants they manage to kill along the way. (pp. 223-224; Carr, 2002).
Carr also addresses the other most important implication of treating terrorism as warfare: it must be
met with warfare, but that warfare must not be excessive, such that it might also be viewed as terrorism. If
our response to terrorism is excessive military might, then the tide of public opinion can swing back in favor
of Al Qaeda, especially in Muslim countries where the United States is not trusted.
Echoing Carr's concerns about the extent and nature of our military actions in the war on terror, one
way in which terrorism might work against us, without seeming to have gained what was intended (if we
can even know what was intended), is if our fundamental democratic principles change. In

Political Ethics in an Age of Terror,

succumbing to the greater evil of seeking revenge. Dershowitz (2002) provides a compelling case for how an
amoral society could control and possibly eliminate all terrorism, but America is not an amoral society. Our
responses are constrained by the constitution and by the political debate that forms the very basis of our
democracy. When we respond to terrorist acts, we must consider what we want that response to accomplish:
Terrorism requires us to think carefully about who we are as free peoples and what we need to do in
order to remain so. When we are confronted with terrorist violence, we cannot allow the claims of national
security to trump the claims of liberty, since what we are trying to defend is our continued existence as a
free people. Freedom must set a limit to the measures we employ to maintain it. (pg. 145; Ignatie, 2004)
Finally, can the ultimate answer to terrorism be found in promoting democratic governments in every
nation? The war on terror has led us to depose both Saddam Hussein in Iraq and the Taliban in Afghanistan,
and to replace them with democratically elected governments. Only time will tell whether those governments
will survive, but there is reason for caution. Religious turmoil continues in the Middle East. In America,
our constitution provides for separation of church and state, and that separation has become an important
tradition.

But for Muslims, the idea of a secular democracy, one that is not guided by Allah, is simply

inconceivable. They are not opposed to democracy per se, indeed it has been argued that Islam is likely to
eventually lead to pluralist democracies (Aslan, 2005). But to pressure Islamic countries into accepting the
secular democracy that we hold so dear is, according to Robert Shedinger (2004), equivalent to declaring
war on Islam. So what appears to be essential to promoting stability in the Middle East, and elsewhere, is
an eort to support contextual democracy, that is, forms of democracy that t with the culture of the people
who will create and participate in that democracy (Aslan, 2005; Moghaddam, 2005, 2006; Shedinger, 2004;
Zadeh, 2002).

Integration and the Human Dilemma
In the preface to Man's Search for Himself

(May, 1953), May presents the existential philosophy that

there is meaning to be found in challenges and suering, and that psychologists in particular may nd a
special opportunity in such circumstances:
When our society, in its time of upheaval in standards and values, can give us no clear picture of what
we are and what we ought to be, . . .we are thrown back on the search for ourselves. The painful insecurity
on all sides gives us new incentive to ask, Is there perhaps some important source of guidance and strength
we have overlooked?. . .How can anyone undertake the long development toward self-realization in a time
when practically nothing is certain, either in the present or the future?. . .The psychotherapist has no magic
answers. . .But there is something in addition to his technical training and his own self-understanding. . .This
something is the wisdom the psychotherapist gains in working with people who are striving to overcome
their problems. He has the extraordinary, if often taxing, privilege of accompanying persons through their
intimate and profound struggles to gain new integration. (pg. 7; May, 1953)

Integration, according to May, is similar to Heidegger's concept of Dasein (being-in-the-world). As
conscious, free, and responsible beings our goal should be to separate ourselves from the conformist, automaton masses (the en-soi, according to Sartre) and progressively integrate with others in freely chosen
love and creative work (May, 1953), or as Clement Reeves puts it: To understand and elucidate the specic,
distinguishing characteristics of the human being, and to grasp what it is to achieve courageous, decisive,
integrated response to the challenge inherent in existence. . . (Reeves, 1977). The process of integration is
lifelong, and should be appropriate for whatever age each one of us happens to be right now. May suggests
that a healthy child of eight, who is fullling his capacity of self-conscious choice for a child of eight years
old, is more of a person than a neurotic adult who is 30 years old. Likewise, a person who can face death
courageously at the age of thirty is more mature than someone 80 years old who cringes and begs still to
be shielded from reality (May, 1953). Thus, it is important to live each moment with freedom, honesty,
and responsibility. If each of us lives within the present moment, working to fulll our potential, being true
to whom we are and the situations within which we live, May proposes that we will experience joy and
gratication:

. . .Does not the uncertainty of our time teach us the most important lesson of all - that the ultimate
criteria are the honesty, integrity, courage and love of a given moment of relatedness? If we do not have
that, we are not building for the future anyway; if we do have it, we can trust the future to itself. (pg. 276;

May, 1953)
One of the challenges to living an integrated life is seen in what May described as the

human dilemma

(May, 1967). Are we the subject of our lives, or are we an object in our world? When we become absorbed
in the details of our responsibilities and actions, when we allow ourselves to be controlled and directed in
order to accomplish our assigned tasks, when we become slaves to the clock, doing this and that, going here
and there, as others expect us to, we are viewing ourselves as objects. This is reminiscent of what Karen
Horney called the tyranny of the should. On the other hand, when we consider our feelings, wishes, and
desires, when we are true to ourselves, or living authentically, then we are viewing ourselves as subjects,
as active participants in our own lives.
capacity to experience ourselves as

According to May (1967), the human dilemma arises out of our

both subject and object at the same time.

But how can opposite poles of

the human experience both be true? It is in the process between the two poles that development of human
consciousness develops, both deepening and widening that consciousness. This is essentially the same idea,
though in dierent form, used by Heidegger and Sartre in describing the unique nature of human beings.
For Heidegger this nothingness was the undened distinction between Being and beings, for Sartre it was
the shell that surrounded the pour-soi.
May believed that existential psychology occupied a space somewhere between the two extremes that
existed, and continue to exist, in psychology: behaviorism vs. humanism. May rejected Skinner's arguments
that all human behavior can be understood in terms of stimuli and responses, declaring that there is ample
evidence in both clinical practice and everyday life of people being active participants in their view of, actions
in, and reactions to their world. He was equally critical of Carl Rogers, believing that humanistic psychologists no longer recognized very real irrational behavior, as well as aggression and hostility (May, 1967).
He believed that psychology had become trapped in a misguided desire to dene everything scientically,
and according to rules that then determined each psychologist's view of the world and their patients. As a
caution to those psychologists who cannot see beyond their theories, May wrote:
Now I am certainly aware, if I may say so without sounding patronizing, that the compelling need for
honesty is one of the motives which leads psychologists to seek quantitative measures. . .I am also aware that
research in our day has to be carefully set up so that the results are teachable and can be built upon by
others. The compelling drive to get at the truth is what improves us all as psychologists, and is part and
parcel of intellectual integrity. But I do urge that we not let the drive for honesty put blinders on us and cut
o our range of vision so that we miss the very thing we set out to understand - namely, the living human
being. (pg. 14; May, 1967)

Discussion Question: May suggested that we need to separate ourselves from the conformist masses,
and then integrate ourselves with others in free and responsible ways. Are you a follower, or a leader? Either
way, do you consciously choose the role you play, thereby living an authentic life?

Love and Intentionality
Love was a very important topic for May. Simply put, To be capable of giving and receiving mature
love is as sound a criterion as we have for the fullled personality (May, 1953). He was certainly not alone.
Harry Harlow, best known for his studies on

contact comfort, described love as a wondrous state, deep,

tender, and rewarding, and Abraham Maslow said We

must

understand love; we must be able to teach

it, to create it, to predict it, or else the world is lost to hostility and to suspicion (Harlow, 1975; Maslow,
1975). However, there are a million and one types of relationships that people call love, so it remains a
perplexing issue (May, 1953).
May talked about four types of love in Western tradition:

sex, eros, philia, and agape (May, 1969). Sex

and eros are closely related, but they are dierent. Sex is what we also call lust or libido, whereas eros is the
drive of love to procreate or create. As changes in society allowed the more open study of sex, prompted by
the work of people like Sigmund Freud and Wilhelm Reich, May noted three particular paradoxes. First, our
so-called enlightenment has not removed the sexual problems in our culture. In the past, an individual could
refrain from sexual activity using the moral guidelines of society as an explanation. As casual sex became
common, even expected, individuals had to face expressing their own morality as just that: their own! This
also created a new source of anxiety for some, namely the possibility that their personal relationships might
carry an expectation of sexual activity, and that if they did not comply they might not be able to continue

Emphasizing technique (or prowess) can result in a mechanistic attitude

toward making love, possibly leading to alienation, feelings of loneliness, and depersonalization. This can
lead to the anticipatory anxiety described by Frankl.

Finally, May believed that our sexual freedom was

actually a new form of Puritanism. There is a state of alienation from the body, a separation of emotion
from reason, and the use of the body as a machine. Whereas in the Victorian era people tried to be in love
without falling into sex, today many people try to have sex without falling in love.
Philia and agape are also related to one another, as with sex and love. Philia refers to feelings of friendship
or brotherly love, whereas agape is the love devoted to caring for others. Friendship during childhood is very
important, and May believed it was essential for meaningful and loving relationships as adults, including
those involving eros. Indeed, the tension created by eros in terms of continuous attraction and continuous
passion would be unbearable if philia did not enter into the equation and allow one to relax in the pleasant
and friendly company of the object of one's desires. Harry Harlow, once again, showed that the opportunity
to make friends was as essential in the development of young monkeys as it appears to be in humans (cited in
May, 1969). In the West, however, given our highly individualistic and competitive society, deep, meaningful
friendships seem to be something of the past, especially among men. May cautions, however, that since the
evidence shows the importance of friendship during development perhaps we should remember the value of
having good friends.
Finally we have agape, a seless love beyond any hope of gain for oneself. May compared this love to the
biological aspect of nature in which a parent will ght to the death in defense of their ospring. With agape,
we run the risk of being like God, in the sense that we know others never act without some degree of their
own interests in mind. Similarly, we don't want to be loved in an ethereal sense, or on the other hand only
for our body. We want to be loved completely. So, all true love involves some element of the other types of
love, no matter how little or how obscured it may be (May, 1969).

In the foreword to Love and Will (May, 1969) May acknowledged

that some of his readers might nd

inuence others, to help to mold and create the consciousness of others. Love without will is sentimental and
experimental, whereas will without love is manipulative. Only by remaining open to the inuence of others
can we likewise inuence them, so love must have an honest purpose, and purpose must be taken with care.

Will, or will power as it is more commonly known, was one of the earliest subjects in American
psychology, having been examined in detail by William James as early as 1890 (see James, 1892/1992) and
again in 1897 in

The Will to Believe

(James, 1897/1992). May considered Sigmund Freud's greatest discovery

to be the uncovering of unconscious desires and motives.

Although many people may believe themselves

to be acting out of higher ideals, most of us are, in reality, acting according to psychologically determined
factors of which we are unaware. Nonetheless, May considered this to be one of the most unfortunate results
of Freud's work. By accepting determinism, we undermine the inuence of will and making decisions. As
May put it, Freud's theory suggests that we are not

driving

any more, but

driven

(May, 1969).

The suggestion that we are no longer in charge of our own lives, that we are driven by psychological
determinism, seems strange to those who believe that never before have people had such power, both in
terms of individual freedom and in the collective conquest of nature. But May referred to a contradiction
in will, the contrast between our feelings of powerlessness and self-doubt and the societal assurances that
we can do anything we set our minds to. May believed that we exist in a curious predicament, in that the
technical wonders that make us feel so powerful are the very same processes that overwhelm us (May, 1969):
Thus, the crisis in will does not arise from either the presence or absence of power in the individual's
world. It comes from the contradiction between the two - the result of which is a paralysis of will. (pg. 189;
May, 1969)
Will alone is not the driving force that leads us to responsible and authentic lives. Underlying will is
something May called

intentionality. Intentionality is the structure that gives meaning to experience, it

is both how we perceive the world and how the world can be perceived by us.

In other words, through

our perceptual processes we inuence the world around us; we aect the very things that we perceive.
Intentionality is a bridge between subject and object (May, 1969). Compare this once again to the nothingness
between beings and Being (à la Heidegger), or between the en-soi and the pour-soi (à la Sartre). Still, our
ability to reach and form the very objects that we perceive, in other words, to participate actively in our
lives, can be dramatically curtailed by the problem addressed by May early in his career, anxiety:
Overwhelming anxiety destroys the capacity to perceive and conceive one's world, to reach out toward
it to form and re-form it. In this sense, it destroys intentionality. We cannot hope, plan, promise, or create
in severe anxiety; we shrink back into a stockade of limited consciousness hoping only to preserve ourselves
until the danger is past. (pp. 244; May, 1969)

Discussion Question: Consider the dierent loves in your life. How do they dier? How have they
brought meaning to your life? Has your view of what love is changed during your life, in either good or bad
ways?

The Daimonic: Source of Violence and Creativity
The

daimonic, according to May, is any natural function which has the power to take over the whole

person (May, 1969). It can be either destructive or creative, and is often both. In this way it is similar to
Jung's concept of the shadow, and May himself made that comparison (May, 1991; see also Diamond, 1996,
Reeves, 1977). In fact, it is the mixture of good and evil in the daimonic that protects us from the dangers
of excess, whether excess good or the passivity of feeling powerless. When May did not know whether he
would live or die from tuberculosis, he realized that his feelings of helplessness were turning into passivity,
and that this was sure to lead to his death (as he had seen with others). He described this experience as the
product of his innocence, and that because he was innocent he allowed the bacteria infecting his body to
do violence to him. However, when he chose to ght the disease, when he asserted his will to live, he began
to make steady progress and, indeed, he recovered. In this sense, May had chosen to allow the daimonic to
take over his self in the interest of self preservation. In each instance, how one allows the daimonic to take
over is inuenced by personal responsibility (Reeves, 1977).
When the daimonic takes over without one having made a responsible choice, however, it can lead to
violence toward others.

Our lives often involve conict between those who have power and those who

do not. When a person feels powerless, helpless, insignicant, they can lash out under the control of the

PSYCHOLOGY

212

daimonic. According to May, violence is bred in impotence and apathy (May, 1972). This can be particularly
important for those who have little or no advantage in our society. In

Power and Innocence

(May, 1972),

May described a patient who was a young, Black woman. Being both Black and female, born before the civil
rights movement, she was about as powerless as one could be in America. Her stepfather had forced her to
serve as a prostitute for years. Although quite intelligent, and successful in school and college, she felt so
helpless that May described her as having no active belief that she deserved to be helped. An important
aspect of therapy for this patient was to get in touch with her anger, to get in touch with the violence that
had been done to her and that she wished to do to others.
In considering the case of this young woman, May concluded that we must not simply condemn all violence
and try to eliminate even the possibility of it. To do so would be to take away a part of full humanity. In this
context, May criticizes humanistic psychology and its emphasis on fullling self-actualization, an emphasis
that May felt moved toward greater moral perfection.

However, the recognition that we are not perfect,

that each of us has good and evil within, prohibits us from moral arrogance. Recognizing this leads to the
restraint necessary for making forgiveness possible.
Our ability to achieve good is dependent on who we are, and who we are is based partly on our own

creativity. Since humans are not simply driven by instinct and xed action patterns, in contrast to every
other creature on earth we must create ourselves. This creation must take place within the world that exists
around us, and must take into account all of the emotions and predispositions that we do carry with us as
biological organisms.
Art - and creative activities of all kinds - can provide comparatively healthy outlets for the constructive
expression of anger and rage. Creativity cannot, however, always substitute for psychotherapy. Nevertheless,
creativity is at the very core of the psychotherapeutic project: The patient is encouraged to become more
creative in psychologically restructuring his or her
the

outer

inner

world, and then to continue this creative process in

world, not only by accepting and adjusting to reality, but, whenever possible, by reshaping it. . .

Creativity can be broadly dened as

the constructive utilization of the daimonic.

Creativity is called

forth from each one of us by the inevitable conicts and chaos inherent in human existence. . . (pp. 255-256;
Diamond, 1996)
Pursuing this creativity is not easy, however. We live in a world that is rapidly changing. Since May's
death in 1994 change in the world has probably even accelerated. May asked whether we would withdraw in
anxiety and panic as our foundations where shaken, or would we actively choose to participate in forming
the future (May, 1975). Choosing to live in the future requires leaping into the unknown, going where others
have not been, and therefore cannot guide us. It involves what existentialists call the anxiety of nothingness
(May, 1975). Making this bold choice requires

courage. One of the reasons we need to be courageous is

that we must fully commit ourselves to pursuing a responsible creation of the future, but at the same time
we must recognize that sometimes we will be wrong.

Those who claim they are absolutely right can be

dangerous, since such an attitude can lead to dogmatism, or worse, fanaticism (May, 1975).
Finally, not only must we accept that we might make bad choices, we must also recognize that our
creativity is limited. In

The Courage to Create

(May, 1975), May described having attended a conference

where the introductory speaker declared that there is no limit to the possibilities of the human being.
Following this statement, the discussion at the conference was a op. May realized that if there is no limit
to what we can accomplish, then there really aren't any problems any more, we only need to wait until
our potentiality catches up with our situation and the problem solves itself. May oered a rather amusing
example to clarify this point:

. . .it

is like putting someone into a canoe and pushing him out into the Atlantic toward England with

the cheery comment, The sky's the limit. The canoer is only too aware of the fact that an inescapably real
limit is also the bottom of the ocean. (pg. 113, May, 1975)
Another inescapable limit is our death. There is no creative act that can change the fact that we will die
someday, and that we cannot know when or how it will happen. May believed, however, that these limits
are valuable, that creativity itself needs limits. He proposed that consciousness arises from our awareness of
these limits, and from the struggle against these limits. May compared this concept to Adler's theory that
much of what we as individuals, and also society as a whole, are arises from our eorts to compensate for

213

inferiority. Thus, our limits lead to what May called a

passion for form. In its passion for form, the mind

is actively forming and re-forming the world in which we live (May, 1975).

Discussion Question: May believed that creatively taking charge of your life required courage. Have
you ever had to make a really dicult decision? Did you take the easy way out, or the safe path, or did you
make a bold decision that oered great opportunity?

The Cry for Myth
As a practicing psychoanalyst I nd that contemporary therapy is almost entirely concerned, when all is
surveyed, with the problems of the individual's search for myths. The fact that Western society has all but
lost its myths was the main reason for the birth and development of psychoanalysis in the rst place. (pg.
9; May, 1991)
The preceding quote is how May began
According to May, the denition of a
world.

The Cry for Myth,

the last book of his career (May, 1991).

myth is quite simple: it is a way of making sense in a senseless

In addition, myths give substance to our existence. In a healthy society the myths provide relief

from neurotic guilt and excessive anxiety, and so a compassionate therapist will not discourage them. In the
twentieth century, especially in Western culture, we have lost our myths, and with them we have lost our
sense of existence and our direction or purpose in life. The danger in this is that people are then susceptible
to cults, drugs, superstition, etc., in a vain eort to replace that purpose (May, 1991).
As we pass through the experiences of our lives, our memory is dependent mainly upon myth. It is well
accepted today that human memory is constructive, and inuenced by our expectations of memory. As May
describes it, the formation of a memory, regardless of whether it is real or fantasy, is molded like clay. We
then retain it as a myth, and rely on that myth for future guidance in similar situations. For example, an
infant is fed three times a day and put to bed 365 days a year, and yet they remember only one or two of
these events from their years of early childhood. For whatever reason, good or bad, these specic events take
on mythic proportions and greatly inuence the course of our lives. May acknowledges the contribution of
Alfred Adler in recognizing the value of these early memories, describing Adler as a perceptive and humble
man, he was gifted with unusual sensitivity for children (May, 1991). As we have seen, Adler considered
the basis for neurosis to be a lack of social interest. In therapy, Adler focused on the guiding ction of a
child's life, something May considered to be synonymous with a myth.

Since memory is the mother of

creativity, and memory depends upon myth, May believed that the myths that form the identity of our
culture are essential for the formation of our self.

The Great Circle of Love. Having covered a variety of
Divine Comedy, Marlow's Faust, Captain Ahab in Moby Dick,

May ends his nal book with a chapter entitled
famous myths in the book, including Dante's
and Poe's

The Raven,

May concludes:

In each of these dramas the liberation of both woman and man is possible only when each achieves a
new myth of the other sex, leading to a new signicant psychological relationship.

They are both then

liberated from their previous empty and lonely existence. The woman and the man nd their true selves
only when they are fully present to each other. They nd they both need each other, not only physically
but psychologically and spiritually as well. (pg. 288; May, 1991)

9.4 Existential Psychotherapy
Existential psychotherapy is not so much a technique as it is an overall approach to understanding the nature
of the human being. By asking deep questions about the nature of anxiety, loneliness, isolation, despair, etc.,
as well as about creativity and love, existential psychotherapists seek to avoid the common error of distorting
human beings in the very eort of trying to help them (May & Yalom, 1995). May believed that American
psychology has had both an anity for and an aversion to existential psychotherapy. The anity arises from
an historical place in American psychology that was very similar to existentialism: William James' emphasis
on the immediacy of experience, the importance of will, and the unity of thought and action. The aversion
arises from the Western tendency to dehumanize people through strict adherence to scientic principles of
research, i.e., to reform humans in the image of machines (May, 1983).

CHAPTER 9. VIKTOR FRANKL, ROLLO MAY, AND EXISTENTIAL
PSYCHOLOGY

214

An essential aspect of existential psychotherapy is to help individuals realize their own being, their own
role in choosing the form that their life will take. This is known as the

I-Am experience. It is all too

common for us to associate ourselves with external factors: I am a professor, I am a student, I work at a
store, I run a business, etc. We repress our own sense of being. To use an example similar to a case described
by May: I am a professor, but that is not really who I am. I am a father and a husband, but that isn't all
that I am. I have a family and a career, but that isn't quite it either. What is left, or what is common in
each of these statements? I am! And as May put it, if I am, I have a right to be (example cited in May
& Yalom, 1995). This realization is not the solution to my problems, but it is a necessary precondition to
nding the courage to pursue the rest of my life.
Once an individual nds the courage to recreate their life, the existential therapist will address a variety
of issues. As discussed above, May placed a great deal of emphasis on anxiety. Guilt is also an important
issue to be addressed, since we may feel guilty about poor ethical choices or instances when we failed to
be responsible with our actions.

As with anxiety, guilt can be normal (after actually doing something

bad) or neurotic (when we fantasize some transgression). Both anxiety and guilt aect how we experience
Kierkegaard's concept of being-in-the-world. Our world can be viewed in several dierent ways, however.
There is the

Umwelt (the world around), the Mitwelt (the with-world), and the Eigenwelt (the own-

world). The Umwelt is the world around us, the natural environment. It encompasses our biological needs,
and the unavoidable reality that we will die one day. The Eigenwelt refers to our self-awareness and our
ability to relate to our selves, and it is uniquely human (May & Yalom, 1995).
The Mitwelt bears a special relationship to another important concept in existential psychotherapy:

time. Because we tend to think about ourselves spatially, as objects within our life, we tend to focus on the
past. In other words, we focus on what we have become, as opposed to what we might be. Moments when
we truly encounter ourselves are rare, but it is only when we grasp the moment that we truly experience
life. Those moments can be positive, such as the experience of love, or negative, such as the experience of
depression, but they are real nonetheless. The Mitwelt contains the inner meaning of the events that occur
in our lives. Individuals who suer from brain damage often cannot think in terms of abstract possibilities,
they become trapped in concrete time. In order to be fully healthy, and something essential to the growth
of humans, is our ability to transcend time:
If we are to understand a given person as existing, dynamic, at every moment becoming, we cannot avoid
the dimension of transcendence. Existing involves a continual emerging, in the sense of emergent evolution,
a transcending of one's past and present in order to reach the future. (pg. 267; May & Yalom, 1995)
Although the content described above might seem very dierent from the type of psychoanalysis described
by Freud, the general process of existential psychotherapy is similar to psychoanalysis. It is accepted that
the client experiences anxiety, that some of this anxiety is unconscious, and that the client is relying on
defense mechanisms in order to cope with the anxiety. A fundamental dierence, however, is the focus of the
therapy. Rather than digging into the deep, dark past, the existential psychotherapist strives to understand
the meaning of the client's current experiences, the depth of experience in the given moment. For this reason,
the therapist-client relationship remains important, but the emphasis is not on transference. Rather, the
emphasis is on the relationship itself as fundamentally important (May & Yalom, 1995).

Discussion Question: Have you ever had an I-Am experience?

9.5 Buddhism and Existentialism: The Completion of a Circle?
Buddhism is by far the oldest theory of psychology that we will cover in this book. Applied existentialism,
particularly the work of Rollo May, is one of the more recent developments in psychology. And yet, these
two approaches share a great deal in common, a fact readily acknowledged by May:

. . .The

likenesses between these Eastern philosophies and existentialism go much deeper than the chance

similarity of words. Both are concerned with ontology, the study of being. Both seek a relation to reality
which cuts below the cleavage between subject and object. Both would insist that the Western absorption
in conquering and gaining power over nature has resulted not only in the estrangement of man from nature
but also indirectly in the estrangement of man from himself. The basic reason for these similarities is that

Eastern thought never suered the radical split between subject and object that has characterized Western
thought, and this dichotomy is exactly what existentialism seeks to overcome. (pp. 58-59; May, 1983)
In Japan there is a form of psychotherapy, known as

Morita, which emphasizes the treatment of anxiety.

The treatment consists of acceptance, reattribution, dereection, and active engagement. The dereection
mentioned is the same technique developed by Viktor Frankl. The active engagement continues this eort
at distracting the client from their anxiety, hopefully breaking them out of the circle of anticipatory anxiety
and subsequent failure described by Frankl. This procedure has proven both successful and, consequently,
inuential amongst Japanese psychotherapists.

A second Japanese technique,

traditional Buddhist approach with elements of existential psychology.

Naikan, combines a more

The client is directed to reect

intensely on their past relationships, and then to consider what they have done for others, what others have
done for them, and the diculties they have caused for others. The goal is to help the client recognize the
interdependence of humans, and to appreciate whether or not they, as well as others, have acted responsibly
within the relationships. By confronting feelings of guilt and unworthiness, it is hoped that the client will
realize that they have been loved and appreciated nonetheless (Walsh, 1995).
Belinda Siew Luan Khong (2003) has examined the role of responsibility in a particular form of existential
psychotherapy known as

daseinsanalysis (developed by the Swiss psychiatrist Medard Boss and grounded

in the philosophy of Heidegger) and compared it to Buddhist practice in the Theravadan tradition.

She

found that daseinsanalysis and Buddhist practices share much in common, and that both have something to
oer to each other:

. . .An

integration of these two disciplines will make their ideas and practices more accessible to commu-

nities outside their traditional domains. The daseinsanalytic and Buddhist perspectives relating to personal
and social responsibility provide us with valuable philosophical and psychological insights into this very important human phenomenon and show us practically how individuals can be assisted in taking responsibility
for every moment of their existence, and to develop a sense of respond-ability to dierent situations. (pg.
158; Khong, 2003)
Stephen Batchelor, a former Buddhist monk turned author and teacher, has presented existentialism
as an interesting approach to the primary problem facing Buddhism in America today (Batchelor, 1983).
According to Batchelor, Buddhism in the west is split between those who wish to follow a traditional path
(emphasizing meditation and practice) and those who insist upon an academic approach to the analysis and
understanding of Buddhism. Between the two approaches lies a great chasm. As we have seen, existentialism
draws its deepest and most meaningful philosophy from nothingness, be it the distinction between Being and
beings (Dasein, according to Heidegger) or the shell separating the pour-soi from the en-soi (as proposed
by Sartre). Drawing primarily from his Buddhist training and the philosophy of Heidegger and Tillich (see
below), Batchelor contrasts

being-alone and being-with. We are essentially alone at birth and at death, in

that we cannot share the experience with others, and this leads to unavoidable anxiety throughout our lives
(though not necessarily overwhelming anxiety for most people). As we will see in the next chapter, the rst
noble truth of Buddhism is that human life is suering. But just as much as we are alone, we are unavoidably
linked to others as well. What matters then, is that we experience authentic

being-with-others, and the

root of authentic being-with is concern for others (as opposed to the inauthentic distortion of self-concern;
Batchelor, 1983).
The genuine welfare of man, of both oneself and others, is found in the optimum actualization of the
potentialities of his being. To exist in the fullest possible way in our aloneness as well as in our relations
with others is the fulllment of the inner aim of human life. . .(pg. 88; Batchelor, 1983)

9.6 Some Final Thoughts on Existentialism and Existential Psychology
Jean-Paul Sartre's

Being and Nothingness

(1943) is considered the dening text of modern existentialism.

Sartre was an atheist, so the brief introduction to existentialism in this chapter went in the direction of
atheism. However, Frankl and May were not atheists, and one of May's most inuential mentors, as well as

a close personal friend, was Paul Tillich. Tillich remains a well-known and respected existential philosopher
in the spiritual tradition. May went so far as to say that Tillich' book

The Courage to Be

might be the

best and most understandable presentation of existentialism as an approach to life that has been written in
English (May, 1983).
It is also interesting to note that both Frankl and May were signicantly inuenced by Alfred Adler.
Frankl worked closely with Adler for a time, and May took a summer course with Adler. Both cite Adler
regularly in their writings. Adler's focus on the childhood struggle against one's own inferiority, his emphasis
on social interest as a responsible means to superiority, and his recognition of the dangers inherent in seeking
superiority at the expense of others, all t well with the existential perspective on making responsible
choices in living one's life. This point emphasizes, once again, the profound inuence that Adler has had on
psychology, and that he is in all probability the most under-recognized gure in the history of psychology.
In 1897, William James published an essay entitled

Is Life Worth Living?

(James, 1897/1992). James

begins by describing how some people see the value in life, indeed they fully enjoy life, no matter what
happens to them or around them.

However, for most people this is not the case, and there is no magic

way to give everyone such an optimistic point of view. So, James presents a series of arguments that one
might use with suicidal people (that is the term he uses) in order to convince them that life is worth living.
He relies heavily on religious faith, though not on any particular religion, but also leads into a discussion
of existential thought. Approximately a decade before Frankl and May were even born, James wrote the
following words:

. . .Suppose,

however thickly evils crowd upon you, that your unconquerable subjectivity proves to be

their match, and that you nd a more wonderful joy than any passive pleasure can bring in trusting ever in
the larger whole. Have you not now made life worth living on these terms?. . .This life
can say,

since it is what we make it, from the moral point of view,

is

worth living, we

and we are determined to make it from

that point of view, so far as we have anything to do with it, a success. . .These, then, are my last words to
you: Be not afraid of life. Believe that life

is

worth living, and your belief will help create the fact. (pp.

501-503; James, 1897/1992)
The challenges that we all face in trying to live authentic lives, the challenges of making responsible
and ethical choices that are true to who we ourselves are, can be dicult. In a fascinating book entitled

Not a Genuine Black Man,

Brian Copeland (2006) talks about his family's racial struggles during the civil

rights movement and the diculties he faces today as a Black man who has adopted many so-called White
cultural values. Copeland insists, however, that we cannot so easily claim that any given value or personal
interest belongs only to one group of people:

. . .When

all is said and done, I AM indeed a Genuine Black Man - because I am resilient.

That's

what being black in America is truly about: resilience. . .I stayed on my feet through taunts and harassment,
through police intimidation and bigoted nuns, through schoolyard bullies and Sylvester, through my mother's
death and bouts of sometimes crippling depression. I am still standing.

I am black because, as my friend Mr. Wilkins once told me, people should be called what they
be called. I have the right and the ability to determine my identity regardless of what other blacks
say. I am not an oreo, nor am I still a nigger. I am a man. I am a black man.

No one person or group of individuals holds the monopoly on what in this society is the true black
experience. My world is as black as that of Malcolm X, Colin Powell, Snoop Dogg, Jesse Jackson, Usher,
Bill Cosby, or Diddy. As their experiences in America are unique, mine is unique - yet it is the same. It is as
valid as that of the poor African American living in the `hood, the rich black rapper balancing a lifestyle
of fame and violence, and the black scholar working to better this world through academic dissertation. It
is as authentic as the experiences of those who marched with Dr. King for civil rights and those who defy
the black community by arguing the conservative point of view.
It is the true black experience because it is

my

experience. . . (pp. 243-244; Copeland, 2006)

Discussion Question: Brian Copeland talked about how dicult it can be to live an authentic life
when you don't meet the expectations of others. Have you ever gone against the advice of family or friends?
Did it prove to be the right decision, or did it at least help you to feel better about your own condence in

Personality Theory in Real Life: The Application
of Frankl's Theories to the Workplace and Everyday Life
In 1989, Stephen Covey published

The 7 Habits of Highly Eective People.

Covey's book became very

popular, selling millions of copies on the way to becoming a #1 New York Times bestseller. If you were
to read the rst chapter of that book now, it would seem very familiar. Covey presents a very existential
approach to understanding our lives, particularly with regard to the problems we experience every day.
Perhaps it should not be surprising, then, that in the chapters describing the rst two of these seven habits
he cites and quotes Viktor Frankl numerous times. Indeed, Covey cites Frankl's rst two books as being
profoundly inuential in his own life, and how impressed Covey was having met Frankl shortly before Frankl's
death (see Covey's foreword in Pattakos, 2004).
The rst two habits, according to Covey, are: 1) be proactive, and 2) begin with the end in mind. He
briey describes Frankl's experiences in the concentration camps, and refers to Frankl's most widely quoted
saying, that Frankl himself could decide how his experiences would aect him, and that no one could take
that freedom away from Frankl! People who choose to develop this level of personal freedom are certainly
being proactive, as opposed to responding passively to events that occur around them and to them. It is not
necessary, of course, to suer such tragic circumstances in order to become proactive in one's own life:

. . .It

is in the ordinary events of every day that we develop the proactive capacity to handle the extraor-

dinary pressures of life.

It's how we make and keep commitments, how we handle a trac jam, how we

respond to an irate customer or a disobedient child. It's how we view our problems and where we focus our
energies. It's the language we use. (pg. 92; Covey, 1989)
Covey compares his habit of beginning with the end in mind to logotherapy, helping people to recognize
the meaning that their life holds.

Covey works primarily in business leadership training, so the value of

working toward a greater goal than simply keeping a company in business from day to day is clear, especially
for those who care about employee morale and quality control (see also

Principle-Centered Leadership;

Covey, 1990). When employees share a sense of purpose in their work, they are likely to have higher intrinsic
motivation. Think about it for a moment. Have you ever had a job you didn't really understand, and didn't
care about? Have you ever been given that sort of homework in school or college? So, how much eort did
you really put into that job or assignment?
Covey's remaining habits are: 3) put rst things rst, 4) think win/win, 5) seek rst to understand, then
to be understood, 6) synergize, and 7) sharpen the saw.

At rst glance these principles seem reasonably

straight forward, emphasizing practical and responsible actions.

However, what does sharpen the saw

mean? Sharpening the saw refers to keeping our tools in good working order, and we are our most important
tool. Covey considers it essential to regularly and consistently, in wise and balanced ways, to exercise the
four dimensions of our nature: physical, mental, social/emotional, and spiritual. By investing in ourselves,
we are taking care to live an authentic life.
More recently, Covey has examined his principles beyond the business world. In 1997 he published

7 Habits of Highly Eective Families,

The

a book in which he applies the same 7 habits to family life. Covey

certainly has solid credentials as a family man, as father of 9 and grandfather of 43 children, and he won
the 2003 Fatherhood Award from the National Fatherhood Initiative.

Drawing in large part on his own

extensive, personal experience, Covey uses many stories, anecdotes, and examples of real-life situations to
help provide context to the challenges of raising a family and how we might best work with them. But rst,
he introduces a simple process: have a clear vision of what you want to accomplish, have a plan of how you
might accomplish it, and use a compass (your own unique gifts that enable you to be an agent of change in
your family). In essence, Covey is recommending that you prepare yourself to develop the seven habits. We
all know how dicult it is to establish a new habit or break a bad habit; how is your New Year's resolution
going?
Just as families change, so does the world we live in. Recently, Covey addressed this change by proposing
an eighth habit (Covey, 2004). He says that this was not simply an important habit he had overlooked before,
but one that has risen to new signicance as we have fully entered the age of information and technology
in the twenty-rst century. As communication has become much easier (e.g., email), it has also become less
personal and meaningful.

Thus the need for the eighth habit: nd your voice and inspire others to nd

theirs.

According to Covey, voice is unique personal signicance.

Essentially, it is the same as nding

meaning in one's life, and then helping others to nd meaning in their own lives. It is through nding a
mission or a purpose in life that we can move from eectiveness to greatness (Covey, 2004).
Whereas Covey presented an approach to personal and professional eectiveness (and later to greatness
as well) that parallels the principles set forth by Viktor Frankl, Alex Pattakos very directly applies Frankl's

Prisoners of Our Thoughts: Viktor Frankl's Princi-

theories to both the workplace and one's everyday life in

ples at Work

(with a foreword by Stephen Covey; Pattakos, 2004). Frankl himself urged Pattakos to publish

his book during a meeting in 1996. Pattakos, like Covey, has been profoundly inuenced by Frankl's writings
throughout Pattakos' career.

According to Pattakos, we are creatures of habit, and we prefer a life that

is both predictable and within our comfort zone. As the world is changing in the twenty-rst century, so
the conditions under which we work are changing. Pattakos believes there is a need for humanizing work.
More than just balancing one's personal life and career, humanizing work is an attempt to honor our own
individuality and to fully engage our human spirit at work.

Simply put, it is an eort to apply Frankl's

will-to-meaning in our workplace (Pattakos, 2004).
Like Covey, Pattakos presents seven core principles.

They are similar to Covey's seven habits, but in

keeping with Pattakos' intentions they are aligned more directly with the principles of logotherapy and
existential psychology described by Frankl. The seven core principles are: 1) exercise the freedom to choose
your attitude, 2) realize your will-to-meaning, 3) detect the meaning of life's moments, 4) don't work against
yourself, 5) look at yourself from a distance, 6) shift your focus of attention, and 7) extend beyond yourself.
These principles include not only the ideas of personal freedom and will-to-meaning, but also dereection
(principles 4 and 6) and the will-to-ultimate-meaning (principle 7). Clearly Pattakos has accomplished his
goal of applying logotherapy to the workplace, but how well does this application work in real life?
Pattakos describes the case of a probation ocer with the state department of corrections.

Rick, as

Pattakos identies him, was raised in foster care and orphanages. However, rather than developing a sense
of caring and concern for others who have diculties in their lives, Rick refers to his clients as maggots.
Rick has become insensitive and unforgiving, he has also become deeply depressed and anxious. Overall, he
feels lost, unhappy, and unfullled, and he doesn't know what to do about it. According to Pattakos, he has
become a prisoner of his own thoughts, and only he has the key to his own freedom. Very simply put, he
needs to nd a new job or nd meaning in the one he has now. One possibility is for Rick to consider his
own life circumstances in relationship to his clients:

. . .Whenever

we stop long enough to connect to ourselves, to our environment, to those with whom

we work, to the task before us, to the extraordinary interdependence that is always part of our lives, we
experience meaning. Meaning is who we are in this world. And it is the world that graces us with meaning.
(pg. 157; Pattakos, 2004)
By making a responsible choice to seek meaning in our lives, to not work against ourselves, we can put
ourselves on a path we had not seen before:
When we live and work with meaning, we can choose to make meaning, to see meaning, and to share
meaning. We can choose our attitudes to life and work; we can choose how to respond to others, how to
respond to our jobs, and how to make the very best of dicult circumstances. We can transcend ourselves
and be transformed by meaning. We can nd connection to meaning at work, in the most unusual places
and with the most unexpected people. Meaning is full of surprises. (pg. 159; Pattakos, 2004)
And nally, it does not matter what sort of job we have. It is our choice, our freedom:
No matter what our specic job might be, it is the

work

we do that represents who we are. When we

meet our work with enthusiasm, appreciation, generosity, and integrity, we meet it with meaning. And no
matter how mundane a job might seem at the time, we can transform it with meaning. Meaning is life's
legacy, and it is as available to us at work as it is available to us in our deepest spiritual quests. We breathe,
therefore we are - spiritual. Life is; therefore it is - meaningful. We do, therefore we work.
Viktor Frankl's legacy was one of hope and possibility.

He saw the human condition at its worst,

and human beings behaving in ways intolerable to the imagination.

He also saw human beings rising to

heights of compassion and caring in ways that can only be described as miraculous acts of unselshness and
transcendence. There is something in us that can rise above and beyond everything we think possible. . . (pg.

Discussion Question: Stephen Covey and Alex Pattakos have applied Frankl's theories to both the
workplace and our everyday lives. How well do you think the principles of existential psychology can address
the problems that you face at work, home, school, etc.? Is it ever really as simple as applying one's will and
choosing to act responsibly? Do you live an authentic life?

9.7 Review of Key Points
•

Existentialism focuses on an individual's subjective truth. The freedom and responsibility that come
with personal truth lead to anxiety, but they can also elevate the individual to lead an authentic life.

•

Heidegger believed that all creatures are connected, but that only humans can become aware of this
connection. Dasein, the realization of this connection, allows us to connect with Being. Awareness of
our impending death, however, leads to anxiety, but if we accept that truth we can live an authentic
life.

•

Sartre believed that humans were unique, something he called en-soi. Awareness of the nothingness that
separates the en-soi from the pour-soi is what drives some individuals to make something signicant
of their lives. For those who cannot, Sartre expressed a need for existential psychoanalysis.

•

Viktor Frankl developed his ideas for logotherapy (an existential psychoanalysis) during his impressive
early career. He had an extraordinary opportunity to put his ideas to the test while imprisoned in the
Nazi concentration camps.

•

Recognized as the third Viennese school of psychotherapy, logotherapy focuses on one's will-to-meaning,
the desire to nd meaning and purpose in one's life.

•

People who cannot nd meaning experience existential frustration, which can lead to a noogenic neurosis.

•

Logotherapy itself relies primarily on the techniques of paradoxical intention and dereection. These
techniques are designed to break the cycle of anticipatory anxiety and failure that plague individuals
who suer from existential crises.

•

Going beyond ordinary, everyday life, Frankl proposed a super-meaning to life, and he suggested that
there is also a will-to-ultimate-meaning that can be pursued through religion or spirituality. In this
light, Frankl referred to logotherapy as height psychology (in contrast to depth psychology, another
term for psychoanalysis).

•

Rollo May believed that anxiety underlies nearly every crisis.

He proposed that anxiety must be

understood in terms of freedom, and he distinguished between normal anxiety and neurotic anxiety.

•

Culture has signicant eects on the nature and amount of anxiety that people are likely to experience
in their lives. Since anxiety can lead to hostility, these cultural factors are, and have been throughout
history, very important issues (e.g., opposition to the civil rights movement in the United States, and
the recent dramatic rise in international terrorism).

•

A critical factor in life, according to May, is our ability to integrate into our world.

One of the

challenges to integration is the human dilemma: whether we are the subject or the object in our lives.
As self-aware beings we can know that we are both subject and object, and so, in psychological terms,
we exist in a world between either behaviorism or humanistic psychology.

•

There are dierent types of love, all of which are very important to our lives. Love can give meaning
to our lives, but it must be honest and responsible love.

•

Through will and intentionality we can give structure to our lives and meaning to our actions. However,
overwhelming anxiety can destroy our ability to participate actively in our own lives.

•

The daimonic is any function that can take over the whole person. It can be a source of violence, but
also a source of creativity. We can choose how the daimonic takes over, and whether that choice is
responsible or not determines whether our actions are violent or creative.

•

Being creative requires that we live in the future and actively participate in shaping our lives. Such
bold choices require courage, especially in light of the inescapable reality that we will die.

•

May felt that myth provides an important cultural framework within which we can form our lives.

PSYCHOLOGY

Unfortunately, the Western world has lost many of its myths, making people susceptible to cults,
drugs, superstition, etc.

•

According to May, the primary goal of existential psychotherapy is to help the client realize their own
being, to have an I-Am experience. Time is an important aspect of this procedure. The client must be
helped to shift their focus from the past to the future, and even more so, to transcend time altogether.

•

Although existential psychology is younger than most other schools of psychology, it has much in
common with ancient Eastern philosophies, such as Yoga, Buddhism, and Taoism.

•

Terrorism is not the result of Islam. Terrorists are found all over the world, from many dierent races,
religions, and nationalities. Islam opposes violence and murder.

•

Terrorism is based on psychological factors (a perception that there are no alternatives, and that
terrorism is legitimate), and seeks to cause psychological eects (feelings of terror and helplessness).
Thus, psychologists have an important role to play in understanding and eliminating terrorism.

•

One can easily nd those who believe that terrorism either never works or always works. Some believe
that we must respond with understanding to eliminate the root causes of terrorism, whereas others
believe we must use force (but not too much force, lest we become terrorists as well). Clearly there are
no easy answers for dealing with terrorists themselves or terrorism in general.

Trait Theories of Personality

Gordon Allport is considered the founder of trait theory. Trait theory is sometimes viewed as dry, inexible,
and devoid of paying attention to the rich and interesting developmental aspects of personality that so many
students enjoy studying. Those same students would probably be quite surprised to learn that Allport is
generally considered to have been humanistic in his approach. It was within his eort to understand the
individual, however, that Allport focused on traits, psychological phenomena that allow some ability to
predict the behavior of an individual. Allport was also concerned about factors that negatively aect people,
such as prejudice. Indeed, in 1954, he published a classic study on prejudice in which he argued that despite
all of humanity's scientic advances we remain in the Stone Age so far as our handling of human relationships
is concerned (Allport, 1979). This concern for all people likely grew out of his profound spiritual faith (for
a collection of Allport's daily prayer reections see Bertocci, 1978). Thus, the trait approach to psychology,
as envisioned by Allport, was anything but dry and inexible, and it paid careful attention to the unique
value of each individual.
Raymond Cattell provides a dramatic contrast to Allport.

His approach to trait theory was purely

scientic and mathematical. He focused on psychological testing, and made extraordinary contributions to
psychology in this regard. Unfortunately, he was also quite dierent than Allport with regard to his views
on racial, ethnic, and other forms of diversity. Cattell was a staunch advocate of

eugenics, the controlled

interbreeding of people to enhance desired human traits. He believed that the government should decide how
to control the eugenic breeding, that rich people should be encouraged and allowed to have more children
than other people, there should be genetic experiments to pursue new and more favorable traits, and once
we can identify such favorable traits we should provide prenatal screening and abort those children who will
not be good enough (Cattell, 1972).
Hans Eysenck, followed by Paul Costa and Robert McCrae, attempted to identify a smaller number of
traits that could be used to provide a reasonable description of an individual's personality. The Five-Factor
Model of personality, identied by Costa & McCrae (see, e.g., McCrae & Costa, 2003), is considered by
many to be the culmination of this area of psychology.

However, there are many personality traits that

are signicant factors for certain individuals, but which do not comprise one the ve major factors. One
example is the sensation-seeking trait described by Marvin Zuckerman (see, e.g., Zuckerman, 1994).

As

such, Zuckerman represents the approach of many trait theorists today: take a trait of interest, such as
sensation-seeking or religiosity, and study it in great detail. In this chapter, we will examine the approaches
taken by these theorists, as well as the form of the theories they subsequently presented.

Brief Biography of Gordon Allport
Gordon Willard Allport was born on November 11, 1897, in Montezuma, Indiana. His father had been
a businessman, but then decided to go into medicine and become a country doctor.

It was in Indiana

that Allport's father set up his rst medical practice shortly before Allport was born, the youngest of four
brothers. The family soon moved to Ohio, eventually settling in Glenville, where Allport spent his school

years. His brothers were considerably older, causing him to feel like an outsider. Despite feelings of isolation,
he worked hard to be the star of a small group of friends. He also did well in school, though he was uninspired
and not curious about much outside of routine adolescent concerns (Allport, 1968).
His home life was marked by trust and aection, but it was not one of leisure. Rather, it was marked by
plain Protestant piety and hard work (pg. 379; Allport, 1968). His mother had been a schoolteacher, and
she encouraged philosophical and religious interests among her children. Also, the family home doubled as
his father's medical clinic and hospital, so there was always much work to be done around the house. Family
vacations were rare, and his father liked it that way. According to Allport, his father believed that everyone
should work as hard as they could and accept as pay only what their family needed to survive, so that there
might be enough wealth to go around for everyone.

In many ways, the Allport children were taught the

importance of being concerned with the welfare of others (Allport, 1968).
After graduating from high school, in 1915, Allport followed his brother Floyd to Harvard University.
Floyd Allport had graduated from Harvard in 1913, and then continued in the graduate program in psychology. Floyd Allport encouraged his younger brother to study psychology, and he was the teaching assistant
for Allport's rst psychology course. At the beginning of his rst semester Allport received poor grades, but
after redoubling his eorts, he ended his rst year with all As. What Allport found most interesting was the
distinction between causal psychology and purposive psychology, and he wondered if the two couldn't
be reconciled. During World War I he was a member of the Students' Army Training Corps, but the war
ended before he had to serve in Europe. Allport also studied in the Department of Social Ethics, and he
engaged in extensive community service. He ran a boys' club in Boston, Massachusetts, did volunteer work
for the Family Society and as a probation ocer, and he spent a summer working at the Humane Society in
Cleveland, Ohio. Allport found this community service to be very rewarding, partly because he enjoyed it,
and partly because it helped him to feel competent (osetting his general feelings of inferiority). He became
convinced that eective social service could only be provided if one rst had a sound understanding of human
personality. At the 1919 Harvard commencement, he received his bachelor's degree and his brother Floyd
received a Ph.D. (Floyd Allport is considered one of the founders of the discipline of social psychology).
After graduating, Allport spent a year teaching English and sociology at Robert College in Constantinople, Turkey. He was then oered a fellowship for the graduate program in psychology at Harvard. On the
way back to the United States, Allport had an extraordinarily inuential meeting with Sigmund Freud. He
stopped in Vienna to visit his brother Fayette, and while there he requested a meeting with Freud.

He

received a kind invitation, and when he arrived Freud sat silently waiting for Allport to state the purpose
of their meeting. Unprepared for silence, Allport quickly chose to relate a story of a young boy he had seen
who was terribly afraid of dirt. The boy's mother was so dominant and proper that Allport thought the
source of the boy's anxiety was clear. Freud, however, looked at Allport and asked And was that little boy
you? Freud had entirely misinterpreted Allport's reason for visiting him, assuming that it was a therapeutic
encounter. Allport became convinced that depth psychology might plunge too deeply, and that psychologists
should consider manifest motives before digging into the unconscious (Allport, 1968).
Allport found graduate school quite easy, and in 1922 he received his Ph.D. However, he was unable to
nd any colleagues who shared his interest in a humanistic approach to the study of personality. Thus, he
had to chart his own path. His rst paper, published with his brother, was on classifying and measuring
personality traits.

His course entitled

Personality: Its Psychological and Social Aspects,

rst taught at

Harvard in 1924, was probably the rst personality course in America. Allport then received a fellowship
that allowed him to spend 2 years studying in Germany and England. In 1925 he married Ada Lufkin Gould,
who had a masters' degree in clinical psychology, and in 1927 they had a son named Robert. Allport also
moved to Dartmouth College that year. In 1928 he and Floyd published a test for measuring dominant and
submissive tendencies, but they never collaborated again. Although they helped each other from time to
time, their psychological perspectives were simply too dierent as their careers progressed (Allport, 1968).
In 1930 Allport returned to Harvard, where he remained for the rest of his career. His rst book,

in Expressive Movement,

The Psychology of Radio (Cantril & Allport, 1935), and
Personality: A Psychological Interpretation (Allport, 1937). It was in the latter book

(Allport & Vernon, 1933). This was followed by

that Allport outlined the majority of the theory for which he is recognized, and it was the culmination of
ideas that had been cooking in his head since graduate school. It was his ambition at the time to give
a psychological denition to the eld of personality.

He certainly helped to accomplish that task, but it

should also be noted that another landmark personality text, with a similar goal, was published the same
year by Ross Stagner, entitled

Psychology of Personality

(Stagner, 1937; for a discussion of the signicance

of these two books see Craik, 1993; Stagner, 1993). Somewhat unfairly, Allport is often recognized for having
published the rst personality textbook, and Stagner is overlooked. However, Stagner was quite young at
the time (only 28 years old). Accordingly, Allport was well-established in his eld, and Stagner cites earlier
work by both Gordon and Floyd Allport numerous times in his textbook.
During World War II, Allport worked with the Emergency Committee in Psychology under the American
Psychological Association.

He spent some time working on the problem of morale among the American

people, and he wrote a daily column for the Boston

Traveler

that focused, in part, on rumors. An important

aspect of rumors was those rumors designed to enhance prejudice and group antagonism. This work led to

The Psychology
The Nature of Prejudice

a series of seminars on race relations for the Boston Police Department, a book entitled

of Rumor

(Allport & Postman, 1947), and ultimately to Allport's classic study

(rst published in 1954; Allport, 1979). Another factor facilitating Allport's work on social issues was the
establishment of a new department at Harvard shortly after WWII: the Department of Social Relations.
Given his lifelong interest in social ethics, Allport ourished in this new environment, remaining active in its
administration throughout his career. Later in his career Allport continued to rene his personality and social
psychological theories, he pursued his interest in social and religious development, with books such as

Individual and His Religion (Allport, 1950) and Becoming

to the analysis of an individual's historical documents. With regard to the latter, Allport had published

Letters from

in 1965. In 1966, as Allport was entering into semiretirement, Harvard University appointed him the

rst Richard Clarke Cabot Professor of Social Ethics. Cabot, a wealthy Boston philanthropist, was also a
professor of cardiology and social ethics at Harvard. Cabot had been a professional friend and mentor to
Allport for many years, and Allport credited him with having a great inuence on Allport's career. As early
as 1919, when Allport was just earning his bachelor's degree, Cabot was commenting on the poor state of
the study of personality. Thus, it is perhaps no surprise that he mentored and supported Allport, who went
on to become the patron saint of personality psychology (Nicholson, 2003).
Allport died in 1967, 1 month shy of his seventieth birthday, leaving behind many unnished books,
articles, and two psychological tests.

Life Achievement

He had received many honors, including a

Gold Medal Award for

from the American Psychological Foundation in 1963 (an award his older brother Floyd

won ve years later) and a

Distinguished Scientic Contribution Award

Association in 1964 (Maddi & Costa, 1972).

from the American Psychological

He was the rst personality psychologist elected president

of APA, and a 1951 survey placed him second only to Freud as a personality theorist whose work was
directly applicable to clinical practice.

However, one award stood out for him, and it is the only one he

mentions in his autobiography. At the XVII International Congress of Psychology, fty-ve of his former
doctoral students gave him a two-volume set of their own writings, with an inscription thanking him for
respecting their individuality. In Allport's own words, this was an intimate honor, and one I prize above
all others (pg.

407; Allport, 1968).

In that same autobiography, which was actually published after his

death, he acknowledged a small number of personality theorists whom he felt were on the right path toward
understanding human life, including Carl Rogers, Abraham Maslow, and Henry Murray.

Placing Allport in Context: The Beginning of Trait Theory
Gordon Allport is viewed by many as the founder of trait theories of personality. In addition, because
of his specic focus on personality itself, he is also viewed as the founder of personality psychology as a
distinct discipline. His entire approach to psychology, and more specically to personality, was born of his
strong devotion to social ethics. He was a profoundly spiritual man, who challenged the negative aspects of
religious dogma and championed the positive aspects of having a spiritual direction in one's life. Because his
psychology carried with it that devotion to social ethics, he wrote one of the most famous books on prejudice,

224

in which he suggested that the future role of psychology in understanding this disturbing inclination of people
everywhere must be based on values.
Since his approach to studying and teaching psychology emphasized the value and uniqueness of each
person, he is considered to have been a humanistic psychologist, even though he is seldom grouped with
Carl Rogers and Abraham Maslow (instead, he is grouped with other trait theorists). Always aware of the
future challenges facing those who would study personality, Allport hoped that movements toward individual,
humanistic, and existential psychology would continue:
I'm quite certain there will be a strong movement toward what is called a third force which will be neither
behavioristic nor psychoanalytic. But I wouldn't be willing to predict that it will dominate the eld, though
I can say I do hope it will develop sturdily and result in fruitful new methods to approach molar and complex
levels of personality structure and social behavior. . .Human nature is such a hard nut to crack that no one
should be denied a chance to contribute to it at any level. (pg. 112; Allport cited in Evans, 1981b)

Allport's Psychology of Personality
As a rule, science regards the individual as a mere bothersome accident.

Psychology, too, ordinarily

treats him as something to be brushed aside so the main business of accounting for the uniformity of events
can get under way. . .With the intention of supplementing this abstract portrait by one that is more life-like,
a new movement within psychological science has gradually grown up. It attempts in a variety of ways and
from many points of view to depict and account for the manifest individuality of mind. This new movement

Personality: A Psychological Interpretation, Allport

established the study of personality as a discipline in the eld of psychology. His goal was two-fold: (1) to
gather together the most important research on personality to date, and (2) to provide a framework within
which the study of personality might then proceed toward understanding this endlessly rich subject-matter
(Allport, 1937).

What Is Personality and What Are Traits?
Allport provides an interesting history of the use of the term

persona, including a set of denitions

written by Cicero (106-43 B.C.): as one appears to others (but not as one really is); the part one plays in
life; the collection of personal qualities that ts one's career (or place in life); and distinction and dignity.
These and other denitions of persona represent a contradiction, that persona, or personality in psychological
terms, is both something vital and internal and yet also something external and false. Although psychologists
came to favor denitions that emphasized an assemblage of personal qualities, Allport noted that no two
psychologists could easily agree on one denition for the term personality. So Allport oered a denition
of his own:
Personality is the dynamic organization within the individual of those psychophysical systems that determine his unique adjustments to his environment. (pg. 48; Allport, 1937)

Dynamic Organization:

According to Allport, personality involves active organization, which is constantly

evolving and changing, and which involves motivation and self-regulation. Thus, it is dynamic, not static.
Organization also brings with it the possibility of disorganization, and the resulting abnormalities associated
with personality disorders and/or mental illness.

Psychophysical Systems :

The term psychophysical is meant to remind us that personality reects both

mind and body, the total organism. The systems include habits, attitudes, sentiments, and dispositions of
various kinds. Most important, however, are the traits, which may be either latent or active.

Determine :

In Allport's view, personality

is

something and

does

something. Personality is not synony-

mous with behavior, it underlies it, and it comes from within the individual. The systems mentioned above
can be viewed as determining tendencies.

Unique :

Naturally, each adjustment by an individual is unique in time, space, and quality.

Allport mentioned this aspect in anticipation of his later discussion of individual vs.

However,

common traits (see

below).

Adjustments to His Environment:

Personality, according to Allport, is a mode of survival, it has functional

and evolutionary signicance. For humans, we are not simply reactive, as plants and animals are, because
we can be spontaneous and creative. We can, and do, seek mastery over our environment (both behavioral

and geographic). Unfortunately, once again the possibility exists for maladaptive behavior that arises under
abnormal conditions (such as an abusive home environment).
In 1961, Allport wrote an updated and substantially revised version of his personality text entitled

Pattern and Growth in Personality.

He made only one signicant change to his denition of personality,

which reected a greater emphasis on cognitive processes. He changed the phrase unique adjustments to his
environment to characteristic behavior and thought (pg. 28; Allport, 1961). He described characteristic
in essentially the same way as he had described unique so that change was insignicant.

However, the

phrase behavior and thought was intended to indicate that individuals do more than simply adjust to their
environment, they also reect on it. Thus, the human intellect is an important factor in the manner in which
we seek mastery over our environment and, indeed, over our lives.
So now we turn our attention to

traits, those special psychophysical systems that are at the center of

Allport's theory of personality. In 1936, Allport and Odbert had examined the 1925 edition of

New International Dictionary

Webster's

and identied 17,953 words (4½ percent of the English language) that described

aspects of distinctive and personal behavior that would commonly be described as traits (see Allport, 1937).
Allport viewed a trait as both a form of readiness and a determining tendency. There are a number of other
concepts that share some similarity with traits, such as

habits, attitudes, needs, types, and instincts.

In each case, however, these other forms of readiness to engage in certain responses or activities are dierent
than traits, particularly with regard to their specicity and external focus or, as in the case of types, they
describe a collection of correlated attributes. After describing the dierences, Allport arrived at the following
denition of a trait:
We are left with a concept of trait as a generalized and focalized neuropsychic system (peculiar to the
individual), with the capacity to render many stimuli functionally equivalent, and to initiate and guide
consistent (equivalent) forms of adaptive and expressive behavior. (pg. 295; Allport, 1937)
The essential aspect of this denition is equivalence, both perceptually and behaviorally. As the result of
a trait, dierent stimuli are perceived as similar, and responded to in similar ways. This occurs regardless of
the nature of the stimuli themselves. Suppose, for example, an individual is paranoid. If someone walks by
and says Hi, how are you today? the paranoid individual might wonder What is that supposed to mean?
Why are they pretending to be so nice? What are they really up to?

As illogical as this response might

seem, a paranoid trait has the ability to render even a simple hello as a threat.
Allport also made an important distinction between

individual traits and common traits. Underlying

this discussion was another important topic in Allport's approach to psychology: the distinction between
the

idiographic and nomothetic approaches to studying psychology. As psychologists attempted to dene

their discipline as a scientic endeavor, they pursued a nomothetic approach, one that emphasizes general
rules that apply to all.

However, the psychology of personality that Allport was pursuing is inherently

idiographic, an approach that emphasizes individuality. Strictly speaking, no two people can have exactly the
same trait. Thus, all traits are inherently individual traits. However, this creates an extraordinary challenge
for psychologists, both experimental psychologists who would measure traits and clinical psychologists who
would describe an individual as possessing a certain trait (at some level) in order to provide a framework for
communication and therapy. Allport agreed that is was logical to assume the existence of common traits,
since normal people in a given culture would naturally tend to develop comparable modes of adjustment.
However, Allport cautioned that developing clinical or experimental measures of such traits would at best
be approximations of the individual traits present in each person (Allport, 1937, 1961).

Discussion Question: Allport described the persona as something vital and internal, yet external and
false. How can this be? Can you think of dierent aspects of your personality that t both perspectives,
and if so, how do those aspects of your personality t together?

Personal Dispositions
Having acknowledged that there is logic to examining common traits as opposed to individual traits,
Allport then returned to each individual's unique personality by addressing

personal dispositions. A

personal disposition is based on traits, but somewhat more complex, such as in a unique combination of
traits (e.g., someone who is tentatively aggressive, as opposed to someone who is belligerently aggressive).
In another important change between the 1937 and 1961 editions of Allport's general personality text,

CHAPTER 10. TRAIT THEORIES OF PERSONALITY

226

the latter book discusses cardinal, central, and secondary dispositions, rather than cardinal, central, and
secondary traits.
A

cardinal disposition is one that dominates an individual's entire life. It cannot remain hidden, and

the individual will be known by it. Historically, some commonly used terms have adopted the reputation of
famous gures, including at least one that appears in the DSM-IV-TR: the Narcissistic Personality Disorder
(named after Narcissus, from Greek mythology). Another example would be to describe someone as Christlike. Personalities that posses one cardinal disposition, however, are quite unusual.
Much more common are

central dispositions. If you were asked to describe a good friend, you would

most likely oer a handful of distinguishable central dispositions. The interesting question, of course, is how
many central dispositions does a typical personal have? Allport suggested that a person's central dispositions
would be those things one would mention in a carefully written letter of recommendation, a response that
might make sense to someone like a professor, who often writes such letters.
Of lesser importance, according to Allport, are the
less consistent, and are less often called into play.

secondary dispositions. These are less conspicuous,
In concluding his discussion of cardinal, central, and

secondary dispositions, Allport acknowledged that these gradations are arbitrary, and presented primarily
for convenience. In reality, he said, there are many degrees of personality organization, from the most loosely
structured and unstable to the most pervasive and rmly structured. The value of these distinctions is to
provide a relative measure of the inuence of traits and dispositions when discussing personality.

Personality Development, Functional Autonomy, and the Mature Personality
According to Allport, a newborn infant has no personality, for it has not experienced the world in which
it will live and it has had no opportunity to develop its distinctive modes of adjusting to that environment.
Personality exists only later, after the common elements of human nature have interacted and produced the
unique, self-continuing, and evolving systems that form the individual's personality. The basic aspects of
growth, following the infant's initial random and diuse behavior, involve dierentiation, integration,
maturation, and learning. As the child's nervous system develops, it gradually gains ner control over its
movement. Little by little, the young child dierentiates more ecient and adaptive patterns of behavior,
including vocal behavior. Psychologically, this dierentiation involves more than just behaviors themselves, it
also includes the ability to control the initiation of those behaviors. Very young children have little capacity
for delaying their actions; they want to do things now!

As the child's behavioral repertoire increases, it

becomes just as necessary and adaptive to begin integrating some of those behaviors into coordinated actions.
Once again, if applied to psychological and cognitive processes, the development of traits and dispositions
begins with the integration of life's experiences. As these processes are occurring, the child is also maturing
physically.

Allport did not view maturation as something that contributed directly to personality, but it

does indirectly by bringing out every inherited feature of the individual, including temperament, intellectual
capacity, physical features, etc.

All of these factors, plus the extensive contribution of dierent types of

learning, contribute to the manner in which the individual experiences their environment (Allport, 1937).
However, we can never truly know the personality that develops:
Of the whole of our own natures we are never directly aware, nor of any large portion of the whole. At
any single moment the range of consciousness is remarkably slight.

It seems only a restless pencil point

of light entirely insucient to illuminate the edice of personality. . .It is through. . .temporal reference and
content, that we arrive at the conviction that we do somehow possess consistent personalities surrounding
the momentary conscious core. (pg. 159; Allport, 1937)
As a sense of self develops, these developmental processes of childhood progress through a series of
stages: (1) a sense of bodily self, (2) a sense of continuing identity, (3) a sense of self-esteem or pride, (4) the
extension of self, (5) a self-image, (6) a sense of self as rationally able to cope, and nally, in adolescence, (7)
a sense of directedness or intentionality. Allport described these seven aspects of selfhood as a sense of
self-relevance that we feel. When combined, they create the me as felt and known. In order to identify this
sense of me or I Allport recommended the term

proprium. Proprium is derived from the Latin term

proprius, and it refers to a property common to the members of some class, but which is not part of the
denition of that class. In other words, everyone has a personality, but no one's personality is part of the
denition of what it means to be a person. But why not simply use the word self ? Allport felt that many

Available for free at Connexions <http://cnx.org/content/col11901/1.1>

227

psychologists use the words self  and ego to mean only one or two aspects of the entire proprium. Also,
Allport wanted to distinguish between the self as an object, and the self as the knower of that object. The
proprium refers specically to the self as an object, whereas self refers both to the object and the knower.
We can be directly aware of the proprium in a way that we can never be fully aware of the knower (Allport,
1961).
As the child matures, both physically and psychologically, the individual's interests and motives become
stable and predictable. A special type of psychological maturity (as opposed to genetic/biological maturity)
takes place, which Allport termed

functional autonomy. Functional autonomy regards adult motives

as varied, and as self-sustaining systems that are unique to the individual.

They may have arisen out of

developmental processes and experiences, but they are independent of them. This means that any tie between
adult motives and early childhood experience is historical, not functional. This is a radically dierent view
than that of Sigmund Freud and most psychodynamic theorists, who considered early childhood experiences
to be the driving force behind adult behavior, especially neurotic behavior. Allport oers the example of
a good workman. Such a workman feels compelled to do his best work, even though his income no longer
depends on maintaining high standards. Indeed, doing his very best on every job may actually hurt him
nancially, but his personal standards, his motivation, demand nothing less (Allport, 1937, 1961). When
viewed a dierent way, functional autonomy serves another important motivational role. If one considers
early childhood experiences to be the determining factors in personality, then all adult motives must have
some infantile source. However, by separating adult motives from their childhood antecedents, then there
does not need to be anything childish about what motivates adults. This allows for entirely new sources of
motivation to be relevant during adulthood, motives that might have been completely beyond the intellectual
and cognitive capacities of children.
In considering what constitutes a mature personality, Allport considered the writings of Sigmund Freud,
Richard Clarke Cabot, Erik Erikson, and Abraham Maslow. He also considered the length of each man's
list. Allport settled on a list of six ideal characteristics of the mature personality. He described the list as an
ideal, because he freely acknowledged that no one is perfect, even the sturdiest of personalities have their
foibles and their regressive moments; and to a large extent they depend on environmental supports for their
maturity (pp. 282-282; Allport, 1961).

Extension of the Sense of Self :

The mature person focuses on more than simple needs or drive-reduction;

they develop strong interests outside of themselves. By truly participating in life, they give direction to their
life.

Warm Relating of Self to Others :

The mature person is marked by two kinds of warmth. On one hand,

through self-extension they are capable of great intimacy in their capacity for love, whether it involves family
members or friends. On the other hand, they avoid gossipy, intrusive, or possessive relationships with other
people. They respect other persons as persons, they express tolerance and the so-called democratic character
structure.

Emotional Security (Self-Acceptance):

Mature individuals demonstrate emotional poise; they have the

ability to avoid overreacting. Especially important, according to Allport, is that they possess the quality of
frustration tolerance.

Realistic Perception, Skills, and Assignments :

Generally speaking, the mature person is in close contact

with what we call the real world. They see things, including people, for what they really are.

Self-Objectication - Insight and Humor :
know thyself.

In describing this characteristic, Allport quoted Socrates:

In Allport's psychology classes, 96 percent of his students thought they had average or

better than average insight (by denition, only 50 percent can be above the average). So people

think

they

have good insight, but this is often not the case. There does appear to be a high correlation between insight
and humor. People who truly know themselves are able to look at themselves objectively, and to laugh at
their own failings and mistakes.

The Unifying Philosophy of Life :

According to Allport, humor may be essential, but it is never sucient.

Maturity requires a sense of life's purpose. This sense of purpose can be found in having a clear direction to
one's life, in a strong orientation to values, within one's religious sentiment, or through a generic conscience.
Allport found it quite interesting that many people consider their desire to serve society was a more important

228

generic motive than the fulllment of any sense of religious or spiritual duty. He concluded that an integrated
sense of moral obligation can provide a unifying philosophy of life regardless of whether or not it is tied to
one's religious sentiments.

Discussion Question: Consider Allport's denition of a mature personality. Do you know anyone who
ts all of the criteria?

What are they like as a person, and do you consider them a friend (or, do they

consider you a friend)?

The Assessment of Personality
Personality is so complex a thing that every legitimate method must be employed in its study. (pg. 369;
Allport, 1937)
In Chapter 1 we examined the common procedures used to assess personality today, and Allport reviewed
similar concepts, as well as procedures that were available at the time. It is interesting to note that, in his
1937 text, the very rst topic in Allport's survey of assessment methods is the importance of evaluating
the cultural setting. Two other topics were also of particular interest to Allport: the study of

behavior and the use of personal documents.
Allport's rst two books,

of Radio

Studies in Expressive Movement

(Allport & Vernon, 1933) and

expressive

The Psychology

(Cantril & Allport, 1935), both addressed what Allport considered to be the second level at which

personality is evaluated (the rst level consists of the traits, interests, attitudes, etc., that compose the inner
personality). He considered the study of expressive movement to be a more direct analysis of personality,
since it is based on observation, and does not require the use of tests that only indirectly address the inner
dispositions revealed in the rst level of analysis. For example, what a patient says or writes while taking

projective, but how they say or write it, the tone of their voice or the style of their
expressive (Allport, 1961). Perhaps the primary value of expressive behavior is that it is

the Rorschach test is
handwriting, is

freely emitted by the person being observed. It can include all aspects of behavior, including walking, talking,
handwriting, gesturing, shaking hands, sketching, doodling, etc. Cantril and Allport examined a variety of
curious aspects of radio voices. For example, a natural voice is more revealing of personality than a voice
transmitted over the radio. They also found that blind people are

not

better at judging personality from

voices than other people, perhaps dispelling the common belief that when people lose one sense they enhance
their ability to rely on other senses.

Much of what they found was dicult to interpret, however.

Voice

denitely conveyed accurate measures of personality, but there are no characteristics of personality that are
always revealed correctly. Most people preferred to hear a male voice on the radio, but no one could actually
explain why, and there were a variety of dierences based on the specic aspects of the message or its content
(Cantril & Allport, 1935). As for handwriting analysis, Allport felt that through careful research it could
become a valid tool for personality analysis. He acknowledged that this was a dicult and complex task, but
he concluded that both handwriting and gestures reect essentially stable and consistent individual styles
(Allport & Vernon, 1933).
There are many types of personal documents, including letters, diaries, recorded interviews, and autobiographies.

Perhaps the richest of these sources, personal letters, may well become a thing of the past.

Letter writing has become much less formal with the advent of phone calls and email. Today, text messages
don't even rely on whole words. Politicians often rely on speech writers, so even their written words aren't
necessarily their own. Of greater concern, according to Allport, is that personal documents are not representative samples and they are not objective (Allport, 1942, 1961). However, if they can still provide insight
into the nature of an individual's personality, then why shouldn't they be used with caution? Allport had a
unique set of letters that had been written over a number of years by a woman, between the ages of 58 and
70, to a young married couple. The young husband had been her son's college roommate. Seeing value in
the letters as a source of psychological material, the couple made them available for publication, and they
came into Allport's possession to be published.

For many years he used the letters to provide examples

in his own classes, and eventually Allport published them again, along with his analysis of the woman's
personality, in

Letters from Jenny

(Allport, 1965).

Of particular interest, is that Allport interpreted the

letters in a variety of ways, including existential, Jungian, Adlerian, and Freudian perspectives.

Allport

concluded by addressing whether or not Jenny was normal, a point on which some people disagreed. Using
his six characteristics of a mature personality, he assigned relatively low scores to Jenny based on her letters,

229

but he also found some strengths within each characteristic. Thus, although Jenny appears to have been
troubled, Allport concludes that it is not a simple matter to say she is normal or abnormal, but her tangled
life has contributed stimulus and challenge to posterity (pg. 223; Allport, 1965).

Religion and Prejudice
Two contrary sets of threads are woven into the fabric of all religion - the warp of brotherhood and the
woof of bigotry.

I am not speaking of religion in any ideal sense, but, rather, of religion-in-the-round as

it actually exists historically, culturally, and in the lives of individual men and women, the great majority
of whom (in our land) profess some religious aliation and belief. Taken in-the-round, there is something
about religion that makes for prejudice, and something about it that unmakes prejudice. It is this paradoxical
situation that I wish to explore here. (pg. 218; Allport, 1968)
Allport was a deeply spiritual man, and he often wrote about the role of religion in personality. Religion
is such an important factor in so many people's lives, that Allport considered it thoroughly ridiculous that
psychologists had paid so little attention to it (see Evans, 1981b).

Although Allport acknowledged that

there were useful and logical reasons for psychology to establish itself as a scientic endeavor, he felt it was
just as illogical to reject religion.

Allport made neither assumptions nor denials regarding the claims of

revealed religion, and he felt that as a scientist he had no right to do so. Still, he believed that psychology
must examine subjective religion in the structure of personality whenever and wherever religion is involved.
So he delivered a series of six lectures on religion, and published them as

The Individual and His Religion

(Allport, 1950). The book takes a positive perspective on the role of religion. Allport acknowledged that
religion seems primarily symptomatic of fear and frustration in many people's live, but he preferred to focus
on the psychology, not the psychopathology, of religion. What he found was that the religious sentiment, as
it pertains to personality, is as varied and unique as each individual. His ndings echoed those of William
James, whose own foray into this area of psychology was published in

The Varieties of Religious Experience

(James, 1902/1987).
The relation between religion and prejudice seems to stem from a dichotomy within religion itself. There
appears to be an intrinsic value and an extrinsic value associated with religion. The extrinsic or outwardly
directed attitude, one that the individual uses for their own purposes, is correlated with prejudice, whereas
the intrinsic attitude is correlated with very low prejudice (Evans, 1981b).

In focusing on the positive

aspects of the intrinsic religious sentiment, Allport suggested that it was attached to the most elusive facets
of becoming, enhancing one's unifying philosophy of life and a sense of direction, intentionality, and good
conscience (Allport, 1955). When fully developed, the religious sentiment is distinct from its developmental
origins (it has functional autonomy). In other words, it is not simply the following of family tradition, or the
practice of meaningless rituals, but rather it becomes a unique part of the individual. It becomes morally
true for the person, as it engages reason, faith, and love. This was particularly true for Allport. From 1938
to 1966, about twice a year, Allport oered a prayerful meditation during the daily prayers in Appleton
Chapel at Harvard University (collected in Bertocci, 1978).

Social Science,

In a meditation oered on

The Virtues and

Allport wrote:

We have much to learn about industrial relations, about the resolution of conict (personal, national,
international); about the control of prejudice, the strengthening of brotherhood and compassion. In such
areas as these we have yet to make vital discoveries; we have yet to think God's thoughts after Him. (pp.
89-90; Allport cited in Bertocci, 1978)
Unfortunately, however, there remains the extrinsic attitude toward religion that is correlated with prejudice. In many ways, religions encourage bigotry, most commonly through doctrines of revelation or election.
Revealed truth is not to be tampered with, and certain people are chosen, or cursed, above all others. However, these attitudes often follow a very selective reading of the religious texts, and even disagree with other
writings.

Nonetheless, one cannot deny the horrifying impact that religion can have when perverted for

purposes of those who wield power. Allport relates stories such as the Nazi Propaganda Minister Goebbels
declaring that Hitler was the intermediary between the German people and God's throne, or the member of
the Ku Klux Klan (an allegedly Christian organization) who justied killing Black children by saying that
when you kill rattlesnakes you don't care if they are young or old (Allport, 1960, 1968). Allport described
such people as using religion as they would use any social group, for their own purposes: making friends,

inuencing people, furthering business pursuits, gaining prestige, etc. It becomes exclusionistic so that only
the members of the group benet, not anyone else. However, although this is a common outcome of religious
activity, there remains a minority of people for whom this does not occur. They serve their religion, not the
other way around. They have adopted the creeds and doctrines as an important component of their value
system, but included within that value system is the doctrine of human brotherhood (see Evans, 1981b).
Religion is, of course, only one factor that leads to prejudice and discrimination.

Allport studied those

factors in great detail in his classic work on prejudice.

Connections Across Cultures: The Nature of Prejudice
Since Allport was committed to social ethics throughout his life, his classic study on prejudice did not
arise suddenly.

During World War II, one of his projects was to study the eects of

rumor. A rumor,

according to Allport's denition, is a specic proposition for belief, passed from person to person, without
any secure standards of evidence. When a rumor follows some event, the information that people report is
based on memory. Important aspects of those memories are often false, and they are false in conjunction with
negative stereotypes. Interestingly, this is much less likely to occur with children, who often fail to identify
the racial aspects of scenes they have observed (at least in a research setting).

Rumors are particularly

dangerous when they incite riots, and Allport and Postman wrote that no riot ever occurs without rumors
to incite, accompany, and intensify the violence (pg. 193; Allport & Postman, 1947). In 1943 there were
major riots in Harlem and Detroit, in which negative racial rumors played an important role. In Detroit in
particular, according to Allport, if the authorities had listened to the rumors the violence might have been
avoided.
The following year, Allport taught a course on minority group problems to the police captains for the city
of Boston, Massachusetts. In 1947 he repeated the course for police ocers in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
One year later, he presented some of his material in a

Freedom Pamphlet

entitled

ABC's of Scapegoating
The

(Allport, 1948). This pamphlet later grew (rather dramatically, from 36 pages to 537 pages) into his book

Nature of Prejudice,

which was published in 1954 (Allport, 1979). Despite this preparation, the challenge

of a major study on prejudice was still daunting.

The problem of the causes of prejudice was so large

that it took Allport several years to work out the table of contents, which ended up being eight pages
long, including sections on preferential thinking, group dierences, perceiving and thinking about group
dierences, sociocultural factors, acquiring prejudice, the dynamics of prejudice, character structure, and
reducing group tensions.
Despite being over 500 pages long,

The Nature of Prejudice

is concise. In part, this indicates the magni-

tude of the problem of prejudice, and also makes it extremely dicult to summarize the book. Allport begins
by asking What is the problem? He describes ve levels at which people act on prejudice. Most people will
only talk about their prejudice with like-minded friends. If the prejudice is strong, they may actively avoid
members of another group, and then they may discriminate against them, engaging in detrimental activities
toward the disliked group. More extreme prejudice may actually lead to physical attacks, and ultimately, to
extermination, such as lynchings or genocide. Is this behavior to be expected? According to Allport, the essential ingredients of prejudice, erroneous generalization and hostility, are natural and common capacities of
the human mind. What is necessary, however, is the formation of in-groups, and the rejection of out-groups.
We form in-groups naturally as we develop; we learn to like the things we are familiar with. This does not
require hostility toward out-groups, but it is an unfortunate reality that many people dene their loyalty to
the in-group in terms of rejecting the values and customs of the out-group. For those people, rejecting the
out-group becomes a powerful need.
Although many dierences exist between groups, why has race been emphasized?

The answer is, in

part, disturbingly simple: we can see race. In addition, most people don't know the dierence between race
and ethnic group, or race and social caste.

Thus, it is simply easier to identify out-groups on the basis

of race. Making matters worse, of course, is the reality that we can't even dene race that well. Allport
discusses research that has suggested as many as thirty dierent human races or types, yet most of us
think in terms of three basic races: White, Black, and Asian (more recently the number would be four,
including Hispanics). Discriminating against one race, such as Blacks in America, without even beginning
to understand individual character (i.e., personality) or other aspects of culture, such as religion, customs,

231

or national character (which can also be quite complex), is simply an ignorant act. Yet a point that Allport
returns to, as an explanation regarding how natural it is to be prejudice, is that people who are dierent
seem strange, and strangeness is something that makes most people uncomfortable, and it may actually be
aversive to many people.
Unfortunately, the victimization of minority groups can enhance the dierences and discomfort that exist
between groups. As Allport noted:
Ask yourself what would happen to your own personality if you heard it said over and over again that
you were lazy, a simple child of nature, expected to steal, and had inferior blood. Suppose this opinion were
forced on you by the majority of your fellow-citizens. And suppose nothing that you could do would change
this opinion - because you happen to have black skin. (pg. 142; Allport, 1979)
Minorities can become obsessively concerned about everything they do and everywhere they go in public.
They develop a basic feeling of insecurity. The simplest response to prejudice is to deny one's membership
in the minority group. For example, some very light-skinned Blacks have passed as White people. But this
can lead to great personal conict, and the feeling that one is a traitor. Huey Newton, co-founder of the
Black Panthers, had to ght against prejudice within the Black community itself against those Blacks whose
skin was viewed as too light. Oppressed minority group members might also become withdrawn, passive, or
they might act like clowns, trying to make fun of their circumstances. Worse, they may identify with the
majority group, leading to self-hate and acting out against members of their own group. Of course, there are
those who will also ght back aggressively, such as Huey Newton and the members of the Black Panthers.
How might we begin to combat prejudice?

Allport discussed an interesting study that addressed the

sociological theory of contact between groups.

During the Detroit riots of 1943, both Black and White

students at Wayne University (which later became Wayne State University) attended class peacefully during
what became known as Bloody Monday.

It has been suggested that when groups of humans meet they

go through a four-stage process: contact itself, followed by competition, then accommodation, and nally
assimilation. Thus, the initial contact naturally leads to a peaceful progression of the inter-group relationship.
While this is not always the case, there are many examples where it has been. But, it cannot occur without
the initial contact. Thus, encouraging contact between groups is an important step in combating prejudice.
Allport notes, however, that it is important for the contact to be of equal status and to be in the pursuit of
common goals.
Allport also addressed the issue of using legislation to ght prejudice. Unfortunately, as he points out,
laws can only have an indirect eect on personal prejudice. They cannot aect one's thoughts and feelings,
they can only inuence behavior.

However, it is also known that behavior can inuence one's thoughts,

opinions, and attitudes. Thus, Allport encourages the continued use of legislation as a signicant method
for reducing public discrimination and personal prejudice.

More important, however, is the need to take

positive action toward reducing prejudice, including the use of intercultural education.

The Nature of Prejudice, Gillespie & Allport presented
Youth's Outlook on the Future (Gillespie & Allport, 1955). What made the

In a fascinating study published one year after
the results of a study entitled

study remarkable was that it included students from the United States, New Zealand, South Africa (both
Black and White students), Egypt, Mexico, France, Italy, Germany, Japan, and Israel.

Included among

the questions was the issue of racial equality, whether students desired greater racial equality and whether
they expected greater racial equality. A large majority of college students reported that they desired greater
racial equality, ranging from 83 to 99 percent.

The notable exceptions were Germany (65 percent), and

English speaking South Africans (75 percent) and Afrikaners in South Africa (14 percent - this was during
Apartheid).

As for the expectation that there would be greater racial equality in the future, students in

most of the countries studied said yes between 67 to 73 percent of the time, with notable exceptions being
Black South Africans (57 percent), Japanese (53 percent), and Mexicans (87 percent). Thus, most college
students around the world (in 1955) desired racial equality, but a signicant portion of them did not expect
to see it in the future. Considering the state of the world today, we are far from learning the nal outcome
of this crucial social issue.
If it were possible to achieve a world in which people were not prejudice, what attitude should replace
it?

This question was recently addressed by Whitley and Kite (2006), and they identify the two most

commonly raised options: color-blindness and multiculturalism.

The

color-blind perspective suggests
multicultural

that people should ignore race and ethnicity, acting as if they simply don't exist, whereas the

perspective considers ethnic/racial identity as cognitively inescapable and fundamental to self-concept.
Color-blind proponents argue that as long as race is an issue, there will be some forms of discrimination.
Multicultural proponents argue in favor or retaining one's cultural heritage, thus preserving integrity, while
also encouraging group interaction and harmonious coexistence.

Does one approach appear to be more

eective at reducing prejudice? To date, the evidence favors the multicultural approach. Whitley and Kite
suggest that reducing prejudice is most likely to occur as a result of individuals both changing their own
attitudes and working to help others change their attitudes as well. It is important to reect on one's own
thoughts and behaviors, and to help others become aware of their attitudes and behaviors. In addition, it
is important to learn more about other groups, and to actively participate in inter-group contact (Whitley
& Kite, 2006). In other words, multiculturalism works best when it actually exists; people need to associate
with people of other races, religions, and cultures. Only then can ignorance, as in simply not knowing about
other people and their cultural dierences, be replaced by knowledge and acceptance.
When Allport published his study on prejudice, it was important that the topic was even being addressed.
Today, it is more common to examine the nature of cultural dierences and to pursue positive aspects of the
value of multicultural settings. A number of recent studies have emphasized various aspects of the dierences
between people from various cultures, the importance of not feeling so dierent, and how interaction between
groups can prove valuable. For example, the Chinese tend to anticipate change more readily than Americans,
they predict greater levels of change when it begins, and they consider those who predict change to be wise
(Ji, Nisbett, & Su, 2001). Asian Americans, South Koreans, and Russians are more likely than Americans
to adopt avoidance goals, but the adoption of those goals is not a negative predictor of subjective well-being
in those collectivist cultures, as it is in individualistic cultures (Elliot et al., 2001). The Japanese appear to
be subject to cognitive dissonance eects in a free choice paradigm, but only in the presence of important
others.

Americans, in contrast, are less aected by social-cue manipulations in a free choice situation

(Kitayama et al., 2004).

Although social stereotyping typically results in an over-generalized tendency

to include people in groups, under certain circumstance it can also lead to excluding certain individuals
from their apparent in-group (Biernat, 2003).

Particularly for young people, in-group connection is very

important. Low-income, high risk African American and Latino teens who do not look like other members
of their in-group are at a much higher risk for dropping out of school, but the ability to t in has a protective
eect (Oyserman et al., 2006). Even when signicant contact between groups does occur, it may only reduce
certain aspects of prejudice, and may do so only for the minority group (as opposed to any change in the
majority group; Henry & Hardin, 2006).

So how can contact between dierent cultural groups begin to

reduce prejudice and discrimination in such a complex issue? It has been shown that when college students
are placed in racially diverse groups, they actually engage in more complex thinking, and they credited
minority members with adding to the novelty of their discussions (Antonio et al., 2004).

Perhaps most

importantly, multiculturalism can also foster the development of a character strength described by Fowers
and Davidov (2006) as

openness to the other.

However, multiculturalism is not without its challenges.

Working in diverse teams can lead to social

divisions, increasing the likelihood of negative performance teams. Accordingly, it is essential to examine the
types of diversity that come into play, since some favor and exploit a wider variety of perspectives and skills,
whereas others more readily lead to conict and division (Kravitz, 2005; Mannix & Neale, 2005). Within
the eld of psychology, a discipline actively encouraging the growth of minority group membership, there
has been a lag in successfully moving students beyond the bachelor's degree to the doctoral level (Maton et
al., 2006). The challenges faced by minority graduate students and faculty are, not surprisingly, as diverse
as the individuals themselves (see Vasquez et al., 2006). Thus, we have a long way to go in understanding
and overcoming prejudice and discrimination.

However, within a framework rst established in detail by

Allport, our examination and understanding of the major issues is rapidly growing.

Brief Biography of Raymond Cattell
Raymond Bernard Cattell was born on March 20, 1905, in the seaside town of Staordshire, England.
Cattell developed a great love for the sea, and his rst book was actually about sailing. His father was a
mechanical engineer who worked on projects such as innovations for WWI military equipment, the steam
engine, and the new internal combustion engine. Cattell was an excellent student, and he earned a scholarship
to attend London University. He majored in chemistry, and he received his bachelor's degree in 1924, with
rst class honors.
The years following World War I were a time of great change in Europe, and Cattell decided that studying
psychology would provide him with the opportunity to address the political and economic issues facing
society. He entered University College in London, where he worked on his Ph.D. with Charles Spearman,
the renowned statistician and expert on intelligence testing (a student of Wilhelm Wundt, and advisor to
David Wechsler as well). During his studies, he was involved in the development of factor analysis, a new
statistical method that was to have a profound eect on the development of psychological tests (including
the MMPI). He completed his Ph.D. in 1929, after which he both worked and continued his education. He
spent six years as the director of the City Psychological Clinic, a child guidance center in Leicester, earned
a master's degree in education, and a doctorate of science degree.
In 1937, he came to America to work with E. L. Thorndike at Columbia University, where he continued
his work on theories of intelligence.

In 1939, he moved to Clark University, where his research interests

turned to developing objective measures of personality.

In part, this work led to his theory on uid vs.

crystallized intelligence. Then, in 1941, at the invitation of Allport, Cattell joined the faculty at Harvard
University. While at Harvard, he was inuenced by Allport and Henry Murray, and Cattell became even
more strongly interested in the study of personality. It was in this stimulating environment that be began
to consider applying factor analysis to the study of personality.
In 1945, Cattell accepted a research professorship at the University of Illinois, where he remained for
nearly 30 years. The University of Illinois soon became the site of the rst electronic computer, providing
Cattell with the technology necessary to conduct large-scale factor-analytic studies on personality (factor
analysis is a math intensive statistical technique, even relative to other statistical techniques). He established
the Laboratory of Personality Assessment and Group Behavior, where he and his colleagues were highly

Personality: A Systemic Theoretical and Factual Study (Cattell, 1950b), Factor Analysis (Cattell, 1952),
and Personality and Motivation Structure and Measurement (Cattell, 1957). In these books, Cattell gathered
productive and produced a number of inuential books advancing psychological science, including

together extensive data from a methodologically sophisticated program of research on the development and
organization of personality. In 1960, he called for an international meeting of researchers in the scientic study
of personality, which resulted in the foundation of the Society of Multivariate Experimental Psychology, and
in 1966 he co-wrote and edited the inuential

Handbook of Multivariate Experimental Psychology

(Cattell,

1966).
After retiring in 1973, Cattell continued his research in Colorado. In 1978, he moved to Hawaii, where
he taught at the University of Hawaii and the Hawaii School of Professional Psychology (which later became
the American School of Professional Psychology). During his career, Cattell received many honors, including
the

Prize from the New York Academy of Sciences, and in 1972 the Society of Multivariate

had used his psychological theories to support eugenics. Essentially, he was accused of using his research to
support racism, and, therefore, he was a racist. In an open letter to the American Psychological Association,
Cattell claimed that his views had been misinterpreted, and that he was being held accountable for statements
made as a young man in the 1930s. However, he continued to publish these controversial ideas in the 1970s
and 1980s. Regardless, Cattell asked that his name be withdrawn from consideration. Less than two months
after writing the letter, Cattell died at his home in Honolulu on February 2, 1998 (Cattell & Horn, 2007;

Placing Cattell in Context: Statistical Analysis of Trait Dimensions
Raymond Cattell stands alongside Allport as one the two principal founders of the trait approach to
understanding personality. As his unique contribution, Cattell brought a level of precision to the scientic
and statistical analysis of personality factors that was not available beforehand. Indeed, Cattell helped to
develop the factor analysis method that revolutionized objective psychological testing. His 16-PF test was
the forerunner of the research that led to today's highly regarded conception of the Big Five personality
traits.
In addition, although he is not generally known for it, Cattell was one of the few early personality theorists
who considered the continuation of personality development throughout the lifespan. His publication of these
ideas coincides with Erik Erikson's publication of his rst major book, so Cattell was not simply echoing the
work of someone who came before him, but rather had developed this interest on his own.
Unfortunately, Cattell also provided the basis for one of the most controversial topics in psychology
today. Specically, he advocated directing the eorts and support of society toward those already advantaged
within it. In contrast, the discipline of psychology, as a social science, is held by the vast majority of its
members to expectations of ethics and morality that emphasize improving the good of

all

people.

Thus,

most psychologists would agree that our discipline, as well as our society, should focus most of its support
on those who need it most, even if that approach does not stand up well to a cost-benet analysis. After all,
how does one apply the concept of costs and benets to the value of a human being?

Basic Concepts of Cattell's Theory
Cattell studied a variety of personality types and personality traits. Of particular interest to Cattell was
how to assess personality, and his work is heavily inuenced by the systematic collection of scientic data.
This is quite dierent than many of the psychodynamic and humanistic theorists, who based their theories
on clinical observation, but it is similar to the learning theorists, who also value careful, objective observation
and the collection of scientic data. Neither approach is inherently better, since they each serve a dierent
purpose. Cattell's approach, however, has had a dramatic eect on psychological testing.

Types and Traits
A psychological type refers to a broader description of personality than a psychological trait, and is
often associated with abnormal psychology. According to Cattell, a type can only be understood in terms of
personality traits. For example, a villain is a type based on a pattern of associated traits such as immorality,
cruelty, and disregard for the law and the rights of others.

Cattell considered types to fall into one of

ve principal categories: temperamental characteristics, interests and character, abilities, disposition, and
disintegration and disease processes. As further examples, and in accordance with Cattell's type categories,
we can include the ancient personality types of Hippocrates (sanguine, choleric, melancholic, phlegmatic),
the oral-erotic and anal-erotic types of Sigmund Freud, musical vs. mathematical geniuses, unrestrained vs.
restrained personalities, and various neurotic and psychotic syndromes (Cattell, 1946, 1950a,b, 1965).
Cattell believed that clinical psychologists always took personality traits for granted, but focused their
attention on the patterns of traits that dened clinical syndromes (or types). However, if one wishes to conduct a thorough description and measurement of personality, traits must be the target of that investigation.
Thus, Cattell focused his attention on the details of understanding and describing traits. He agreed with
Allport's description of individual vs. common traits, though he preferred the use of the term

unique traits

to describe the former. Cattell described a trait as a collection of reactions or responses bound by some sort
of unity, thus allowing the responses to be covered by one term and treated similarly in most situations. The
challenge lies in identifying the nature of the unity, which has been done in dierent ways throughout the
history of studying personality. For Cattell:

. . .the

unity of a set of parts is established by their moving - i.e., appearing, changing, disappearing -

together, by their exercising an eect together, and by an inuence on one being an inuence on all. (pg.
71; Cattell, 1946)
Thus, a trait guides behavior in a specic direction, by connecting all aspects of that trait into a unit
(whether the process is directed outward, a response, or the result of external stimuli, a reaction). Since an
understanding of an individual's traits would allow us to predict the nature of such responses or reactions,

Cattell oered a rather simple denition of personality:
Personality is that which permits a prediction of what a person will do in a given situation.

(pg.

2;

Cattell, 1950b)
According to Cattell, traits and types are not fundamentally dierent, but rather opposite extremes of
the same statistical measures. The fundamental, underlying traits are known as

source traits. Source traits

often combine and/or interact in ways that appear, on the surface, to indicate a single trait. For example,
in the area of abilities, a unitary intelligence shows itself in good academic performance, such a child who
does well in school. Of course, children who do well in school typically do well in most areas, such as math,
English, social studies, etc. What may now appear to be a type, a good student, can also be described
as a

surface trait (Cattell, 1950b). As useful as surface traits, or types, may be descriptively, in order to

truly understand personality, one must address the source traits. First, however, they must be identied.

Source Traits and Factor Analysis
Cattell used the factor-analytic technique to identify sixteen source traits. He often uses the terms source
trait and

factor interchangeably. Factor analysis is a statistical technique that determines a number of

factors, or clusters, based on the intercorrelation between a number of individual elements. Cattell considered
factor analysis to be a radical departure from the personality research that preceded his, because it is
based on an arbitrary choice as to which variables are the most important.

not

Instead, the factor-analytic

technique determines the relevant variables, based on the available data:

. . .the

trouble with measuring traits is that there are too many of them!...The tendency in the past has

been for a psychologist to fancy some particular trait, such as `authoritarianism', `extraversion', `exibility-vs rigidity', `intolerance of ambiguity', etc., and to concentrate on its relations to all kinds of things. . .individual
psychologists lead to a system which tries to handle at least as many traits as there are psychologists! (pg.
55; Cattell, 1965)
When Cattell applied factor analysis to the list of words identied by Allport and Odbert, he identied
16 personality factors, more or less. The reason for saying more or less is that any statistical technique is
subject to known probabilities of error. Thus, Cattell considered his sixteen factors to be only an estimate
of the number of source traits (Cattell, 1952). As potential source traits were identied that Cattell found
dicult to put into words, he assigned them a Universal Index (U.I.) number, so that they could be kept for
consideration until they could be studied and explained. Cattell identied as many as forty-two personality
factors (see Cattell, 1957).

By 1965, when Cattell wrote

The Scientic Analysis of Personality,

he had

included three additional factors to his primary list, giving him nineteen personality factors, and kept
thirteen of the remaining factors on his list as yet to be conrmed (though each one had a tentative name).
In the late 1940s, Cattell and his colleagues developed the

Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire

(commonly known as the 16-PF), based on the 15 factors they considered best established by their data, plus
general intelligence as the sixteenth factor (see Cattell, 1956). The sixteen factors are described in Table
13.1. In a very interesting chapter written by Heather Cattell (Cattell's third wife), the 16-PF proles are
presented, and compared, for a married couple in which the husband was undergoing therapy with Heather
Cattell (see H. Cattell, 1986). She described how the proles oer insight into the problems occurring for
Mr. A (as the husband is identied in the chapter), both in his personal life and in his marriage. Although
the marriage ended in divorce, a subsequent follow-up found both Mr. A and Mrs. A seemingly doing well
in their separate lives.

The Types of Data Used in the Assessment of Personality
In a rather obvious statement, Cattell noted that in order for a psychologist to study correlations there
must be two measures available to be correlated. The systematic measure of various aspects of the mind,
including personality, has led to the development of a specic branch of psychology known as

psychometry.

In order for a psychometrist to get a complete and unbiased measure of personality, they must have a concept
of the individual's total behavior, what Cattell called the

personality sphere. Cattell believed this could

best be accomplished by taking a sample 24-hour period in the person's life and collecting three types of data:
measures of the individual's life-record, or

L-data; information provided by questionnaires, or Q-data;
T-data (Cattell, 1965).

and data on their personality structure provided by objective tests, or

L-data deals with the individual's actual everyday situations. Ideally, L-data can be collected without
the need for the judgment of a trained psychometrist. Examples of specic behaviors include things such as
their grades in school, the number of automobile accidents a person has had, the number of times they have
been arrested by the police, how many organizations they belong to, etc. Sometimes these data are not so
easy to obtain, and must be gathered from someone who knows the person well. For example, we may ask
friends or family members to rate the person in terms of how sociable they are in school, how emotionally
stable they are when playing sports, or how responsible they are (Cattell, 1965).
Q-data is obtained by having the person ll out a questionnaire, such as the information sheet you ll
out when waiting to see a doctor for a medical exam. Unfortunately, these data are subject to a number of
problems, such as distortions due to poor self-knowledge, delusions about the self, or the deliberate intention
to fake the outcome of the questionnaire. Therefore, it is very important that a psychologist choose the right
words when developing a questionnaire:

Although a questionnaire looks like a simple series of questions to which a person underlines a brief
answer, such as `yes', `no', `generally', [sic] etc., actually a great deal of art enters into the psychologist's
choice of words, the direction of the question, the use of adjectives to ensure that all alternatives are well
used, and so on. (pg. 61; Cattell, 1965)
As noted above, T-data is obtained from objective tests. According to Cattell, questionnaire may seem
objective, since their scoring is objective, but the process involves having the individual evaluate themselves.
In truly objective tests the individual's specic behaviors or thoughts are directly and precisely measured.

closed-ended questions are used, such as multiple choice or Yes-No options. If
open-ended questions are used, such as How do you feel when you wake up in the morning? it is

It is essential that only

possible that two psychologists will interpret the answer quite dierently. If there is a possibility of dierent
interpretations, obviously the test cannot be objective.
In comparing the three types of data, Cattell made some interesting observations regarding L-data.
Although it occurs naturally, measuring it is articial and somewhat arbitrary. Although it is objective in
the sense that it is real behavior, it is neither created nor controlled, it is simply observed. It is also subject
to cultural dierences much more so than Q-data and T-data. Of particular concern to Cattell, however,
was the commonplace nature of L-data:
Much of the irresponsible theorizing on personality criticized in Chapter 1 happens to have grown up in the
realm of L-data, for this has been the traditional eld of observation of the philosopher, the armchair observer,
and the clinician, whereas Q- and T-data have been developed by the psychometrist concerned with the more
disciplined methods. L-data is, indeed, the eld of behavior that is the common property of everyone. . .there
arises at this point the need for a proper development of measurement techniques particularly as they apply
to L-data. . . (pp. 54-55; Cattell, 1957)

Discussion Question: Cattell believed that personality assessment worked best when the psychologist
understood a person's entire personality sphere. To accomplish this, one needs to measure L-data, Q-data,
and T-data. Do these data provide a complete picture of the person? What data do you think might be the
most dicult to obtain, and how might that aect the overall personality picture?

Stages of Development
infancy, childhood, adolescence, maturity, middle age,
old age. Infancy, from birth to 6 years old, is the great formative period for personality (pg. 211;

Cattell described six principal life stages:
and

Cattell, 1950a).

In relation to its family members, the infant develops its basic social attitudes, sense of

security or insecurity, the strength of various defense mechanisms (which determine whether the individual
will be prone to neuroses), and the general strength of the ego and super-ego. Childhood, the period from age
six to fourteen years old, is, according to Cattell, a relatively easy period of consolidation. The child grows
toward independence, moving from its family to relationships with peers. Children are primarily realists,
but they may have an active day dream life as they long for the status and privilege of adult life (Cattell,
1950a,b).
Adolescence is, of course, a period of psychological storm and stress, requiring many adjustments and
readjustments in one's life. Covering the ages of approximately 14 to 23 years old, Cattell believed that the
stress experienced by normal individuals could best be illustrated by its consequences in extreme personalities.
Adolescence is the time when some individuals become delinquents, whereas others show the initial signs of
mental illness and neurotic behavior. While many of the changes occurring during adolescence are due to the
physiological changes associated with puberty, external factors are also critical. All cultures appear to have
some ritual associated with the break between childhood and adulthood, and many arrange for an initiation
or formal ritual to take place. Of course, there are also positive changes associated with adolescence, such
as increased interest in the arts of emotionality and love: poetry, religion, and drama (Cattell, 1950a,b).
Indeed adolescence is the time when even the dullest clod knows that he possesses a soul; and it has been
said of the genius that he lives in a perpetual adolescence. (pg. 215; Cattell, 1950a)
Adulthood brings with it maturity, and the pursuit of a career, a mate, a family, and a home. From age
23 to 46 years old, personality becomes set, and the chosen habits of adolescence become settled. Cattell
considered it a busy and happy time for most people, but not for those few who failed to resolve their
adolescence.

They become, in Cattell's words, shipwrecked in physical disease, mental illness, and the

242

persistent inability to solve the questions of work and wife (or husband, as the case may be; Cattell, 1950a).
Middle age is characterized by the beginning of certain physical and mental changes that begin the inevitable
decline toward old age and death. Thus, middle age demands a reevaluation of one's life values, and often
leads to the search for some philosophy to make sense of life. Positive changes include an increase in leisure.
First, the responsibilities for raising children lessen as the children move out on their own, and later, one
approaches the age of retirement.
Old age requires further adjustment, as one begins to question one's place and value in society.

This

can cause the frustration of ego needs and a sense of insecurity, which can lead to a restricted range of
interests, crabbiness, and constant worry about one's nancial state and physical health. However, many
people retain their general intellectual capacity and positive attitude toward life unimpaired until death.
Even in 1950, Cattell took note of the growing number of people who were living longer and doing so in
better health, thus making our understanding of the psychology of old age an increasingly important issue
(Cattell, 1950a,b). That trend not only continues today, but may actually be increasing as our knowledge
of medicine and interests in health psychology continue to grow.

National Character and Intelligence
Cattell was interested in measuring intelligence throughout his career. Just before coming to the United
States, he published

A Guide to Mental Testing

(Cattell, 1936), which covered topics as diverse as the

measurement of intelligence, aptitudes (mechanical, musical, artistic, etc.), scholastic attainment, temperament, interests, and character. Much later in his career, Cattell conrmed his controversial interest in the
relationship between intelligence and national achievement (see Cattell, 1983).

What made this research

controversial was the apparent racist overtones of the research. As noted above, Cattell claimed that his
views were taken out of context, and that the most controversial claims were made in the 1930s, before he
even came to the United States. However, consider some of the following statements written by Cattell in
1983!
In the state of Hawaii, where I happen to be writing, there are at least a dozen ethnic groups of good
sample size and diering in racial composition and life style. The lack of seriousness about education, and
lack of concern with conversations on things of the mind, can be well brought into relief by comparing some
low groups (which shall be nameless) with say, high groups such as the Japanese, the Chinese, and the Jews,
whose literacy, school achievement, and employment rates are high. (pg. 12; Cattell, 1983)

. . .a

15 point dierence in average tells us nothing immediately about an

individual,

White or Black. It

does tell us that there will be considerable overlap of the two groups. . .It also tells us, however, that if we
look for persons with I.Q.s of above, say, 130. . .the chances of nding a Black among 1,000 or of a White
among 1,000 to exceed 130 is far higher in the second group. (pg. 41; Cattell, 1983)

. . .regarding

special educational expenditure. Should it be on the top, say, 10% of highly gifted children

or on the lagging 10% of dull and backward children?...A eugenist is compelled to argue that the social
conscience should, in terms of family planning have shifted the higher birth rate in the rst place from the
I.Q. 70-80 range to the I.Q. 120-130 range. (pg. 59; Cattell, 1983)
Incidentally one would expect most eect on both productivity and potency of national defense to derive
from the magnitude of the supply

in the topmost ranges

of intelligence, from which, given appropriately

more advanced education, resourceful management and benecial invention result.

The numbers in that

range depend both on their birth rates and the assortiveness of mating, and a rise in the latter could
admittedly

temporarily

oset a decline in the former. Surely

everyone

will agree that the schools should

turn to giving appropriate education to these much brighter individuals, but it will take

public

a more far-sighted

to encourage measures for their greater production. (pp. 14-15; Cattell, 1983)

Taken together, these suggestions lead to very clear impression of Cattell's opinions and goals: there are
low groups and high groups of people, Blacks in America are a low group, special education spending
should not be wasted on people of low intelligence, the families who produced those children should not
have any more children, and resourceful management should be used to ensure that high groups have
more children and low groups do not!

What makes these views most disturbing is not that one person

has them, but rather, that Cattell has colleagues who agree with him. Most notorious, in recent times, was
the publication of

The Bell Curve

by Herrnstein & Murray (1994; for a discussion of some of the problems

Available for free at Connexions <http://cnx.org/content/col11901/1.1>

243

associated with

The Bell Curve

see Belgrave & Allison, 2006).

The suggestion of people like Cattell, Herrnstein, & Murray, that society should discard whole groups
of people is unconscionable to many people, and should have no place in a psychology that emphasizes the
improvement of the human condition. Another somewhat controversial gure, Arthur Jensen, also argues
that general intelligence, or

g

as it was rst described by Spearman, is largely inherited, but at the same

time he acknowledges that there is an environmental component to even this most basic aspect of intelligence
(Jensen, 1998). Considering any role for environmental factors in intelligence, we must then take into serious
consideration the discriminatory practices that denied adequate education to minorities throughout history,
both in America and elsewhere. When provided with good education, Blacks have demonstrated an equal
ability to learn as compared to Whites (see Belgrave & Allison, 2006; Miller & Garran, 2008). Thus, rather
than seeking to exclude people from opportunities to advance within our society, we should be encouraging,
as much as possible, equal access to educational support systems.
In a somewhat related article, Robert McCrae (whose research on the Big Five personality traits will be
examined below) and Antonio Terracciano examined whether or not there is a valid basis for determining
national character based on personality traits. People in all cultures have shared perceptions of what people
are like in both their own culture and in other cultures, perceptions which form the basis of stereotypes.
After examining data from nearly fty dierent countries, McCrae & Terracciano concluded that national
character stereotypes are unfounded, even when examining people's impressions of their own country (McCrae
& Terracciano, 2006)! Clearly, if stereotypes based on personality are not accurate reections of personality,
how can stereotypes based on measures of intelligence have a meaningful bearing on our decisions regarding
social programs?

Discussion Question: Cattell created a great deal of controversy with his views on nationality, race,
intelligence, and achievement. What eect, if any, do you think it has on the eld of psychology when one
of its leading scientists makes an issue of such controversy? How much worse, if at all, did it make it when
he claimed he was being persecuted for comments made in the 1930s as a young man, when in fact, he had
continued to publish these ideas as late as 1983!

Hans Eysenck's Dimensions of Personality
Hans Eysenck oered a theory of personality that was much more concise than that of Cattell, suggesting
that there were only three major factors. He also emphasized the importance a hereditary basis for personality
and intelligence, and he applied his research to some important everyday life circumstances. Accordingly, he
was a very popular and widely acknowledged researcher. In 1997, he was identied as the most widely cited
living person, second only to Sigmund Freud and Karl Marx amongst the most cited individuals of all time
(Jensen, 1997). In addition, he was honored with not one, but two

Festschriften,

the rst on his sixty-fth

birthday (Lynn, 1981), and the second in honor of his eightieth birthday (Nyborg, 1997).
Eysenck was born in Berlin, Germany, in 1916. His parents divorced when he was 2, and he was raised
by his grandmother, seeing his parents only once or twice a year. He was a star athlete, including being a
nationally ranked tennis player. He left Germany to escape the Nazis in 1934, and spent a brief period of time
studying literature and history in France and England. His grandmother, however, died in a concentration
camp around 1941 or 1942. He eventually began studying psychology at University College in London, under
the renowned Cyril Burt. He earned his Ph.D. in 1940, and during World War II he worked as a research
psychologist using factor analysis to study personality. After the war he became a psychologist at Maudsley
Hospital, where he became friends with Philip Vernon (who completed his Ph.D. with Allport; see, e.g.,
Allport & Vernon, 1933), then helped to form a psychiatry institute at the hospital and aliated with the
University of London. He spent the rest of his career there, though he spent some time as a visiting professor
in the United States (Eysenck, 1982, 1997). Eysenck received numerous awards during his career, including
a

Distinguished Scientist Award from
The Structure of Personality

the American Psychological Association. He died in 1997.

According to Eysenck, the sixteen primary personality factors identied by Cattell in the 16-PF test
were unreliable and could not be replicated. Eysenck chose instead to focus on higher order factor analysis,
and he identied three  superfactors:

extraversion, neuroticism, and psychoticism (Eysenck, 1982).

According to Eysenck, higher order factors are similar to types, and they represent combinations of primary

CHAPTER 10. TRAIT THEORIES OF PERSONALITY

244

personality traits.

Thus, he considered the sixteen factors that Cattell included in the 16-PF as primary

factors, whereas extraversion, neuroticism, and psychoticism were second-order factors (or types). Actually,
even the primary factors are comprised of lower level responses that result in a hierarchical model of personality: specic responses, habitual responses, traits (or factors), and nally, types (or superfactors). Similarly,

g,

or general intelligence, is a higher order factor than its component intelligences (e.g., verbal, numerical,

memory, visuo-spatial, and reasoning).

Thus, Eysenck's theory does not contradict that of Cattell, but

rather looks at a higher level of personality structure (Eysenck, 1952, 1967, 1970).
An extravert is commonly described as an outgoing, expressive person, but the technical denition described by Eysenck is more complex. Extraversion is a combination of sociability, impulsiveness, frivolity,
general activity, and overt sexuality. The complex nature of each higher order factor may lead to some of the
dierences in personality theory. According to Eysenck, the impulsiveness associated with extraversion is
most likely hereditary (a temperamental trait), whereas the sociability aspect of extraversion is more likely
to be inuenced by one's environment. Thus, perhaps, it is not surprising that Eysenck nds support for
hereditary inuences on personality whereas others, like Cattell, nd support for environmental inuences.
Depending on how one designs their questions and experiments, the component traits within a higher order
factor can support dierent perspectives (Eysenck, 1982).
Neuroticism refers to one's emotional stability, or lack thereof. It incorporates mood swings, poor emotional adjustment, feelings of inferiority, a lack of social responsibility, a lack of persistence, issues of trust
vs. suspiciousness, social shyness, hypochondria, and the lack of relaxed composure. Neuroticism raises the
intensity of emotional reactions. Since it is a function of the reactivity of the autonomic nervous system,
it is an inherited characteristic. Individuals who measure high in neuroticism are more likely to suer from
neuroses, but high neuroticism is not necessarily less desirable than low levels of neuroticism. For example,
aesthetic appreciation and creativity can benet from an individual being highly emotional. On the clearly
negative side, high levels of neuroticism have routinely been found in criminals, perhaps because whenever
an individual has antisocial tendencies, a high level of neuroticism enhances their fear/anxiety responses
and functions as a powerful, albeit dysfunctional, drive (Eysenck, 1977, 1982; Kendrick, 1981). Cattell also
studied neuroticism, and his ndings were very similar to those of Eysenck (Cattell & Scheier, 1961).
Psychoticism was added to Eysenck's theory well after identifying extraversion and neuroticism, and it is
the least clearly dened or heritable of the three superfactors. It incorporates traits of dominance-leadership,
dominance-submission, sensation seeking, and the lack of a superego. Children who score high on a measure
of psychoticism tend to have behavior problems and learning diculties, they become loners, skip school,
commit crimes, and are generally disliked by teachers and peers.

Whether as children or as adults, they

do not typically benet from traditional psychotherapies or counseling, as there tends to be a paranoid,
suspicious barrier.

There is some evidence, however, for successful treatment with intensive behavioral

techniques. Interestingly, whether or not these children become criminals as adults seems to depend on how
they score on the other two superfactors.

High neuroticism seems to be the factor which makes juvenile

delinquency a habit that persists into a life of crime (S. Eysenck, 1997).

Discussion Question: In contrast to Cattell's sixteen primary factors, Eysenck proposed just three
superfactors. Can a reasonable evaluation of personality be conducted along just three dimensions? If not,
do you think these are still the three most essential dimensions?

The Role of Heredity in Personality
Eysenck believed strongly in the inheritance of personality and intelligence.

If it is true that genetics

plays a major role in personality, then evolution should provide us with an interesting test: do other primate
species demonstrate the same superfactors that we see in humans?

Eysenck examined this question in

conjunction with Harry Harlow. After conducting factor analysis on the social behavior of rhesus monkeys,
they found three clear behavior factors:

aectionate, fearful, and hostile social behavior.

These factors

match well with the human factors of extraversion, neuroticism, and psychoticism, respectively. Of course,
there were marked dierences between animals, but those dierences were characteristic and reliable for each
monkey. Thus, it would appear that the biological basis for personality superfactors can be conrmed in
comparative psychological studies (Chamove, Eysenck, & Harlow, 1972).

Figure 10.1

Whether heredity or learning is more important in personality development remains unclear.
Reviews of Eysenck's overall contribution to the eld of behavior genetics have, however, been the subject
of debate. Whereas some praise Eysenck for identifying the signicant role that genetic determinants play
in personality factors (see Martin & Jardine, 1986), others argue that Eysenck's own data provide evidence
that he overstated the signicance of genetics (see Loehlin, 1986). Indeed, Loehlin suggests that the data in
Eysenck's own publications can be interpreted to suggest that genetics account for about half of the variance
in personality factors, which leaves the other half subject to the environment. Still, Loehlin acknowledges
Eysenck's primary role in bringing these issues into the realm of science, and he commends Eysenck for
providing his data openly, so that others, like Loehlin, might be able to evaluate and debate those results
(Loehlin, 1986). Eysenck, for his part, acknowledged the points made by Loehlin, and expressed hope that
continued research in the future would help to better clarify the role of genetics in determining behavior,
intelligence, and personality (Eysenck, 1986).

Personality and Real Life Issues
Although Eysenck's approach to personality focused on group dierences and genetics, he was not without
concern for the individual and her or his daily life. He also challenged the way in which psychologists are
pursuing their discipline, and the eect it has on the public's view of psychology.

Psychology is About People,

In 1972, he published

which included jokes about psychology and psychiatry, as well as topics as

diverse as sex, socialism, education, pornography, and behaviorism (Eysenck, 1972). In

of Psychology

Uses and Abuses

he challenged the stereotypes associated with views on national character, and urged the

learning of facts about other cultures (numerous other topics are covered as well; Eysenck, 1953). In

and Nonsense in Psychology

Sense

he examined such things as hypnosis, lie detectors, telepathy, interpreting

dreams, and politics:
If it be true that there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamed of in our philosophy, it
is surely equally true that things are dreamed of in our philosophy which do not appear in heaven or on

earth. Among these gments of the imagination appear such varied objects as the philosopher's stone, which
was supposed to transmute base metals into gold, the Oedipus complex, which was supposed to transmute
a normal person into a gibbering neurotic. . .and the Jungian archetypes, which are supposed to haunt our
modern minds with mystical reminders of the inherited wisdom, or otherwise, of our race. (pg. 71; Eysenck,
1957)
Eysenck wrote extensively about sex and personality, and the role that violence and the media may play
in distorting sexuality (e.g., Eysenck, 1976; Eysenck & Nias, 1978). He also wrote about the relationship
between personality and criminal behavior (e.g., Eysenck, 1964; Eysenck & Gudjonsson, 1989), and the role
that personality and stress play in the lives of people who smoke cigarettes (Eysenck, 1991). Like Cattell,
Jensen, and others, Eysenck was very much caught up in the controversy over racial dierences in intelligence
testing (see, e.g., Eysenck, 1973a,b, 1995; Eysenck & Kamin, 1981; Pearson, 1991). Eysenck, however, oered
something for the average person, two books on how to measure your own I.Q. (Eysenck, 1962, 1966). Late
in his career, Eysenck oered an interesting reection on his decision to focus most of his career on dierences
between people, as opposed to the uniqueness of each person:
Gordon Allport and I did not always see eye to eye on theoretical matters. I remember very well him
telling me that he thought every psychologist should write his autobiography at the end of his life, to see the
unities that emerged in his conduct over a lengthy period of time. This idiographic point of view contrasted
very much with my own nomothetic one, and at the time I paid little attention to it. Now, half a life-time
later, I can see what he was driving at, and can also see the possible importance of such consistencies of
behaviour in one's own life. (pg. 375; Eysenck, 1986)

Discussion Question: Eysenck wrote two books that challenged the eld of psychology:

Abuses of Psychology

and

Sense and Nonsense

Uses and

in Psychology. What advantages do you think it has for the

eld when someone of Eysenck's stature questions the scientic validity of certain areas of study or certain
procedures?

Paul Costa and Robert McCrae and the Five-Factor Model of Personality
Costa and McCrae followed in the footsteps of Eysenck, but they expanded slightly upon the number
of second order factors. The result of their eorts became one the most widely respected perspectives on
personality structure today: the

Five-Factor Model of personality. Indeed, the Five-Factor Model has

been so well researched, research that has supported and expanded the original conception, that Costa and
McCrae believe it now deserves to be referred to as the

Five-Factor Theory (see McCrae & Costa, 2003).

Paul Costa earned a Ph.D. in human development from the University of Chicago in 1970. He taught for
2 years at Harvard University, and then joined the faculty of the University of Massachusetts at Boston. In
1978 he joined the National Institute on Aging, a branch of the National Institutes of Health. Since 1985,
he has been the Chief of the Laboratory of Personality and Cognition, Gerontology Research Center. He
also holds appointments at the University of Maryland, Duke University Medical Center, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, and the Georgetown University School of Medicine. Among numerous
awards, he has been elected as a Fellow of the Gerontological Society of America, the American Psychological Association, and the Society of Behavioral Medicine. He has published hundreds of research articles,
many of them in collaboration with Robert McCrae. McCrae earned his Ph.D. in personality psychology
at Boston University in 1976. After teaching and conducting research at Boston University, the Veteran's
Administration Outpatient Clinic in Boston, and the University of Massachusetts at Boston, in 1978 he
joined the Gerontology Research Center at the National Institute on Aging, where he continues to conduct
research today. He is also a Fellow of the Gerontological Society of America, as well as a Fellow of the American Psychological Society and Division 20 (Adult Development and Aging) of the American Psychological
Association (for more information visit the National Institute on Aging website at www.grc.nia.nih.gov).

The Five-Factor Theory of Personality
Costa and McCrae acknowledged the important role that Eysenck played when he identied extraversion
and neuroticism as second-order personality factors, and for developing the Maudsley Personality Inventory,
the Eysenck Personality Inventory, and the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (the latter test, developed
with his wife Sybil, was the rst to include psychoticism; see S. Eysenck, 1997) as tools for measuring these
factors. However, they disagreed with Eysenck regarding psychoticism. They initially proposed a dierent

247

factor called

openness.

When they discussed this issue with Eysenck, he felt that openness might be

the opposite pole of psychoticism, but McCrae and Costa believed the factors were signicantly dierent
(see Costa & McCrae, 1986). Since that time, Costa and McCrae have moved beyond the third factor of
openness, and added two more second-order factors:

agreeableness and conscientiousness (see Costa

& McCrae, 1989; Costa & Widiger, 1994; McCrae & Allik, 2002; McCrae & Costa, 2003).

Together,

NEO Personality Inventory (or NEO-PI) to measure neuroticism,
extraversion, and openness, and later they developed the Revised NEO-PI, or NEO-PI-R, which also
Costa and McCrae developed the

measures agreeableness and conscientiousness (see McCrae & Costa, 2003).

The general descriptions of extraversion, neuroticism, openness, agreeableness, and conscientious are
listed in Table 13.2. It is important to note that these ve factors are distinct, and neither low nor high
scores are necessarily better or `good' or `bad:'

. . .all

traits have passed the evolutionary test of survival, and from society's point of view all kinds of

people are necessary: those who work well with others and those who can nish a task on their own; those
who come up with creative new ways of doing things and those who maintain the best solutions of the past.
There are probably even advantages to found [sic] in Neuroticism, since a society of extremely easygoing
individuals might not compete well with other societies of suspicious and hostile individuals. Cultures need
members t for war as well as peace, work as well as play. . . (pp. 51-52; McCrae & Costa, 2003)
As a basis for studying personality, the Five-Factor Model has proven quite comprehensive.

The ve

factors stand up well when measured with a variety of other tests and within other theoretical perspectives,
including a thorough comparison with the list of human needs proposed by Henry Murray.

Particularly

important in psychology today, the Five-Factor Model has also stood up very well when examined across
cultures, a topic we will examine in more detail in

Connections Across Cultures.

Intracultural analyses look at the specic expression of traits within a culture. And nally, intercultural
analyses compare trait characteristics between cultures (see Allik & McCrae, 2002). In 2002, McCrae and
Allik published

The Five-Factor Model of Personality Across Cultures,

a collection of research in which a

variety of investigators examined the applicability of the Five-Factor Model (FFM) in a wide variety of
cultures. The various studies contained in this book examine personality structure, as well as the validity
and generalizability of using the NEO-PI-R to measure personality, in some forty cultures spread across ve
continents. McCrae and Allik acknowledge that there is much more to personality than just traits, but the
traits identied in the FFM appear to oer a robust cross-cultural foundation for understanding personality
worldwide.
The potential validity of translating the NEO-PI-R and studying the FFM in dierent cultures is based
on the idea that the most important factors in human interaction would be encoded in the languages of most,
if not all, cultures (see Pervin, 1999). Given concerns regarding this lexical hypothesis and the challenges of
translation, Peabody (1999) used trait descriptions with contrasting terms to help clarify matters in a study
on the judgment of national character. He had judges from 12 dierent European countries, plus America,
the Philippines, Japan, and China rate one another. Upon examining the data from a FFM perspective,
Peabody found strong support for the utility of this model in cross-cultural studies. Other investigators have
had signicant success using the NEO-PI-R in direct translation. Rolland (2002) collected data from studies
in which the NEO-PI-R was administered to people in cultures speaking 16 dierent languages (including
Sino-Tibetan, Indo-European, Uralic, Hamito-Semitic, and Austronesian languages, and one unclassied
language [Korean]).

Overall, he conrmed the generalizability of the personality structure identied by

the FFM in these varied cultures. Similar favorable results pertaining to personality structure have been
identied with both adults and adolescents in Czeck, Polish, and Slovak groups (Hrebickova, et al., 2002) and
amongst the Shona in Zimbabwe (Piedmont, et al., 2002), as well as for the relationship between personality
and emotion amongst Canadian, Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean subjects (Yik, et al., 2002) and the
relationship between personality and cultural goals in Americans and Vietnamese (Leininger, 2002). These
studies, as well as numerous others that are not mentioned, provide substantial support for the consistency
of the FFM across a wide variety of cultures, at least as far as personality structure is concerned. However, it
remains unclear whether the scores obtained from two dierent cultural groups are equivalent (see Poortinga,
Van de Vijver, & Van Hemert, 2002). In other words, if Culture A scored higher than Culture B on, say,
agreeableness, it may be that the translation used for Culture A is more responsible for the result than an
actual dierence between Cultures A and B. Further research will be necessary in order to address issues
such as this.
Despite the numerous studies that support the cross-cultural application of the FFM, there are psychologists, generally favorable to the FFM, who nonetheless emphasize caution. The fundamental question
is whether or not trait descriptions are how people in other cultures describe another person. While it is
true that using abstract trait names is common practice in American culture, in other cultures, such as
India and China, it is more common to describe people in terms of context dependent actions. To t such
data into a FFM requires some manipulation, which leaves the validity of the work open to some debate
(see Pervin, 1999). However, when comparing Chinese and American students, the FFM does provide an
adequate measure of each group's stereotypes regarding one another (Zhang, et al., 1999). What is clear is
the need for continued research on cross-cultural perspectives, as well as a need for cross-cultural training
programs. In that regard, Brislin (1999) has oered ways in which the FFM can be used as one basis for
developing such programs, in part by telling us something about each person in a cross-cultural training
program and, therefore, which type of program might work best for them (see also McCauley, Draguns, &
Lee, 1999). Whether one favors the FFM or some other model of personality structure, the importance of
cross-cultural studies is clear:
Human nature cannot be independent of culture. Neither can human personality. Human beings do share
certain social norms or rules within their cultural groups. More than 2000 years ago, Aristotle held that
man is by nature a social animal. Similarly, Xun Kuang (298-238 B.C.), a Chinese philosopher, pointed out
that humans in social groups cannot function without shared guidance or rules. Therefore, each culture or
cultural group establishes its own norms. Constantly, these norms and rules are connected with the behavior

and personality of members within a culture and society. (pg. vii; Lee, McCauley, & Draguns, 1999)
In proposing a Five-Factor

Theory

of personality, McCrae and Costa addressed the nature of personality

theories themselves:
A theory of personality is a way of accounting for what people are like and how they act; a good theory explains a wide range of observations and points researchers in the right direction for future research.
Freudian theory pointed researchers toward the study of dreams, but decades of research have yielded very
little by way of supportive evidence. . .Trait theory pointed researchers toward general styles of thinking,
feeling, and acting, and has resulted in thousands of interesting and useful ndings. That is why most personality psychologists today prefer trait theory to psychoanalysis. . .But. . .there is more to human personality
than traits. (pp 184-185; McCrae & Costa, 2003)

basic tendencies (which are the
characteristic adaptations, and self-concept (a highly adapted and extensively

They propose that there are three central components to personality:
ve personality factors),

studied form of characteristic adaptation). The basic tendencies interact with three peripheral components
that mark the interface with systems outside personality.

There are the biological inputs to the basic

objective biography (all that a person does and experiences).
Connecting all of these components are dynamic processes, such as perception, coping, role playing,
tendencies, the external environment, and

reasoning, etc. Although this theory is newer, it does account for one of the most important issues challenging
trait theories in general: how does one account for the general consistency of traits, yet the potential for,
and occasional observation of, change in personality? Simply, the basic tendencies are consistent, whereas
the characteristic adaptations are subject to change, both as a result of dramatic environmental inuences
and due to changes associated with aging (McCrae & Costa, 2003).

Consistency Across the Lifespan
In over 25 years of teaching, it has been my experience that most college students

want

to believe

that adult personality can readily change. Likewise, most psychologists, particularly clinical psychologists
helping people to change their dysfunctional lives,

want

to believe that personality can change. However,

trait theorists have repeatedly shown that traits are highly resistant to change once adulthood has been
reached (see, e.g., Costa & McCrae, 1989; McCrae & Costa, 2003). This is particularly true for Neuroticism,
Extraversion, and Openness, for both men and women, and for Blacks and Whites. While Costa and McCrae
acknowledge that individuals sometimes change dramatically, as a general rule, consistency is clearly more
important. They also suggest that this should be an opportunity for optimism. As individuals age, they
should not fear becoming a dierent person, such as someone isolated or depressed. If, however, an individual
of younger age is isolated, depressed, or suers from some other psychological malady, they should also realize
that time or aging alone is not likely to change them, but rather, psychotherapy may be a desirable and
eective course of action.

Once again, Costa & McCrae emphasize the newness of these theories, and

suggest the need for systematic prospective studies of the Five-Factor Theory over the entire adult lifespan.
Fortunately, the NEO-PI-R provides the tool necessary to evaluate the Five-Factor Theory throughout life
and in dierent cultures. Given the steady increase in life expectancy in Western societies, and the growing
percentage of elderly people within our society, this research is likely to become a priority in the eld of
personality.

Marvin Zuckerman and the Sensation Seeking Personality Trait
Marvin Zuckerman represents the current approach taken by many psychologists who study traits. He
developed an interest in one particular trait, and he has studied that trait in great detail.

He called it

sensation seeking, and in order to study it carefully he also developed the Sensation Seeking Scale.
The study of this trait has enjoyed a certain popular appeal, exemplied by the success of the

X Games

and,

more recently, the popularity of televised mixed martial arts competitions.
Zuckerman was the son of a mechanical engineer who came to America from Russia. His mother's father
had also come from Russia, and both sides of the family had a tradition of their sons becoming rabbis. As
a boy, Zuckerman enjoyed playing football, but most of his sensation seeking centered on reading adventure
books. He rst became interested in psychology when he encountered a book about graphology. When he
entered the University of Kentucky, he experienced the disinhibitory joys of drinking, sex, and hitchhiking
around the country (pg. 46; Zuckerman, 1993). He then suered a period of depression, during which he

discovered the work of Sigmund Freud. He decided to become a psychoanalyst, so, after serving his duty in
the army (following World War II), attended New York University. Unfortunately, a bad grade in chemistry
made it impossible to get into the medical school of his choice, so he chose to begin the graduate program
in clinical psychology at NYU.
Zuckerman found it dicult to nd an area of psychology that appealed to him, except for a vague
interest in experimental studies that suggested an exploratory drive, something we might also call curiosity,
in a variety of animal species. Zuckerman also found clinical work unfullling, so he began to focus more
on conducting research.

He spent a few years at a hospital and then a psychiatric research institute in

Indiana, where he began studying sensory deprivation (see, e.g., Zuckerman et al., 1962).

In contrast to

sensory deprivation, he also began to study sensation seeking, its apparent counterpart. After several moves,
including the threat of being red from Adelphi University due to newspaper photos of the college professor
arrested and lying in the local jail (following his involvement in a protest against racism), in 1968 he joined
the faculty of the University of Delaware. Since he found it dicult to nd continued funding for sensory
deprivation research, he began to focus on sensation seeking itself. In 1975, Zuckerman took a sabbatical
to work with Hans Eysenck, leading to the publication of some joint papers, and Zuckerman's eventual
contribution to Eysenck's second

festschrift

(see Zuckerman, 1997). His work on sensation seeking, and his

relationship with Eysenck, have led Zuckerman to become one of today's leading proponents of the biological
basis of personality.

He retired in 2002, but has remained busy enjoying life, giving talks, writing, and

conducting research (Zuckerman, 1983, 1991, 2006).

The Sensation Seeking Trait
Sensation seeking is a trait dened by the need for varied, novel, and complex sensations and experiences
and the willingness to take physical and social risks for the sake of such experience. . .The high-sensation
seeker is sensitive to his or her internal sensations and chooses external stimuli that maximize them. (pg.
10; Zuckerman, 1979)
All people seem to seek an optimal level of stimulation and/or arousal. For some, that level of arousal
is quite high, for others, it is rather low.

The concept was not new when Zuckerman began to study

sensory deprivation and sensation seeking.

Indeed, the examination of

optimal levels of arousal

dates back to the very beginning of psychology: the experimentalist Wilhelm Wundt was studying it as
early as 1893 (see Zuckerman, 1979), as were Sigmund Freud and Josef Breuer in 1895 (Freud and Breuer,
1895/2004). Following the

brainwashing techniques used by the Chinese during the Korean War, the

Canadian government pursued research on sensory deprivation, work led by D. O. Hebb.

Following this

early research, Zuckerman began his own investigations. Generally, sensory deprivation leads to increased
anxiety, somatic discomfort, and thinking and concentration diculties. In addition, many of the subjects
experienced both auditory and visual hallucinations. None of the eects of sensory deprivation seemed to
correlate with any personality variables (Zuckerman et al., 1962). It was because of these profound eects of
sensory deprivation that Zuckerman began to pursue the underlying variable that leads individuals to their
optimal level of arousal.
The Sensation Seeking Scale has been revised a number of times.

The fth version was developed in

collaboration with Hans and Sybil Eysenck, and included comparisons of males to females and American
students to English students (see Zuckerman, 1979, 1994). Using factor analysis, Zuckerman and his colleagues have identied four subscales within the sensation seeking trait:

Thrill and Adventure Seeking: Many people enjoy engaging in risky sports and other potentially
dangerous experiences that produce unique sensations related to speed or defying gravity, such as rock
climbing, BASE jumping, or drag racing. This factor is exemplied by the sports included in the X Games.

Experience Seeking: This factor encompasses novel sensations and experiences, such as arousing music,
art, and travel. It also incorporates social nonconformity, particularly associated with belonging to groups
on the fringes of conventional society.

Disinhibition: This factor covers sensation seeking that focuses on social activities, such as parties,
drinking, illegal drugs, and sex.

Boredom Susceptibility: Individuals who score high on this factor cannot tolerate any kind of repetitive experience, including routine work and boring people.

Sensation seeking comes in many forms. Here, the author is hanging from two ice screws about 800 or
900 feet up the alpine route Pinnacle Gulley on Mt. Washington in New Hampshire. The temperature was
an invigorating -15 o F.
Sensation seeking should not be confused with being reckless.

For example, individuals who are high

sensation seekers are more likely to have varied sexual experiences, but they are not more likely to avoid
using condoms. They may be more inclined to drive fast, but they are not less likely to use their seatbelts.
And rock and ice climbers take full advantage of safety gear, they study self-rescue techniques, and they
check their gear carefully before each trip. However, adolescence may be a particularly risky time, since there
is a temporal gap between the onset of puberty, during which adolescents are highly thrill seeking, and the
slow maturation of the cognitive-control systems that govern such behavior in adulthood (Steinberg, 2007).
It is also important to note that it is neither good nor bad to score high or low on this scale:
In this sociobiological sense, the high sensation seeker is a hunter and the low sensation seeker is a
farmer. Hunters are positively excited by change, danger, and the variety and unpredictability of the hunt.
They need a strong capacity to focus attention on the prey while remaining alert to other factors like the
direction of the wind and the movements of other hunters.

Farmers, in contrast, depend on stability of

the environment (rainfall, sun, and other seasonal regularities of climate). Plants grow slowly and require
patience and tedious kinds of labor to insure their survival. (pp. 384-385; Zuckerman, 1994)
During the course of his research, Zuckerman found a close relationship between sensation seeking and

impulsivity. If he limited his factor analysis to ve factors, as Costa and McCrae had, impulsivity and
sensation seeking always combined to form a factor that he called impulsive sensation seeking. This
proved to be rather curious, since impulsivity was a substrate of neuroticism, whereas excitement seeking
was a substrate of extraversion. Another problem that Zuckerman expressed with regard to the Five-Factor
Model was his belief that words like conscientiousness have no meaning in species other than humans. Since
Zuckerman favors a biological/genetic basis for personality, there should be evolutionary correlates of any
personality structure in other animals, particularly the closely related apes. Thus, Zuckerman examined his
data, conducted a factor analysis, and oered an alternative to the Five-Factor Model. His ve factors are
sociability, neuroticism-anxiety, impulsive sensation seeking, aggression-hostility, and activity (Zuckerman,
2006). While Zuckerman did not intend for his ve factors to match those of Costa and McCrae exactly, it is
easy to see a relationship between sociability and agreeableness, activity and extraversion, sensation seeking
and openness, and neuroticism and neuroticism.

Aggression-hostility, however, seems to relate more to

Eysenck's factor psychoticism. Thus, there remains a need for continued research into this eld, particularly
as it pertains to the evolutionary basis for personality factors, but Eysenck, Costa, McCrae, and Zuckerman
have provided an excellent and coherent basis for further research.

who have an opposite score on those same scales?

Grit - Getting Things Done!
Another specic trait that has become somewhat popular recently in higher education has been called

grit

by Angela Duckworth and her colleagues (see Duckworth et al., 2007). Grit is dened as the perseverance
and passion necessary to accomplish long-term goals. In particular, it refers to the ability to continue striving
toward those goals despite temporary failure, adversity, and plateaus in one's progress. Although much of
the research on grit has focused on academic goals, grit does not correlate well with intelligence. Rather, it
correlates highly with the Big-Five trait of conscientiousness.
We used to believe that individuals who become experts in a particular area (whether it's math, playing
a musical instrument, playing chess, or competing in athletic events, etc.) had some innate ability or talent
for their skill. However, Anders Ericsson proposed and studied a dierent theoretical framework. Although
an individual may show some early talent in a particular domain, what resulted in their becoming an expert,
or a star athlete, was the intensive

deliberate practice that followed, often taking many years before the

individual truly excelled (Ericsson, 2004; Ericsson et al., 1993). Working together, Duckworth, Ericsson, and
a few of their colleagues showed that deliberate practice is the key to success in an academic competition
that tends to fascinate many people because of just how dicult it is: the National Spelling Bee (Duckworth
et al., 2010).
Whether it's grit, consciousness, or the associated behavior of deliberate practice, those who continue to
strive toward their goals tend to succeed not only in school, but also in most aspects of life, including life
satisfaction and earning a good income (Duckworth & Carlson, 2013; Duckworth et al., 2012). But what can,
perhaps, interfere with one's ability and/or motivation to continue striving toward one's goals? It appears
that life stress in early adolescence can signicantly impair one's ability to strive toward a positive and
fruitful future (Duckworth et al., 2013). It's quite possible that since adolescence is the time of developing
one's identity, according to Erik Erikson, and identity associated with negative life events and stress is
incompatible with maintaining grit.
As I mentioned above, this is an area only recently becoming well-known (i.e., popular) in the eld of
higher education. It is likely to become an increasingly signicant factor in how we work toward helping
students achieve their goals, whether academic or in other aspects of their lives.

Final Note: Moving Toward a New Big Five?
In 2006, Dan McAdams and Jennifer Pals argued that personality psychology has failed to provide a
comprehensive framework in which we can understand the whole person. Since this was a guiding principle
of many of the founders of this eld, an eort to combine recent research with early principles would help the
eld of personality psychology move toward maturity. In a manner similar to Costa and McCrae's Five-Factor
Theory, McAdams and Pals suggest that those who study personality should be guided by ve fundamental
principles: evolutionary design, dispositional traits, characteristic adaptations, integrative life narrative, and
culture. Their examination of these principles led them to the following denition of personality:
Personality is an individual's unique variation on the general evolutionary design for human nature,
expressed as a developing pattern of dispositional traits, characteristic adaptations, and integrative life
stories complexly and dierentially situated in culture. (pg. 212; McAdams & Pals, 2006)
If personality psychologists use these principles in their ongoing eorts to understand each individual,
they should be able to achieve an understanding of an old paradox oered to explain personality: every
person is like every other person, like some other persons, and like no other person (see McAdams & Pals,
2006).

Personality Theory in Real Life: Reconceptualizing Personality Disorders
within the Context of the Five-Factor Model

Available for free at Connexions <http://cnx.org/content/col11901/1.1>

257

There remains debate as to exactly how personality disorders should be classied (see the Appendix). This
issue is more than just a matter of curiosity, since our entire conception of personality disorders is an essential
factor in how we approach their treatment. As perhaps the most widely accepted and scientically validated
trait perspective on normal personality, it stands to reason that the Five-Factor Model (FFM) ought to also
provide a basis for classifying abnormal personality and, in particular, the personality disorders. Thus, Costa
and Widiger (1994) brought together a group of experts, including Theodore Millon, to address personality
disorders within the context of the FFM.
The

DSM-III

and

DSM-IV

use diagnostic categories for the personality disorders, whereas the FFM

suggests a dimensional approach. The categorical approach has several advantages. It is relatively easier
to conceptualize disorders as either having them or not, clinicians are familiar with the current categories,
and when clinical decisions are categorical they tend to be consistent. However, the dimensional approach
oers the advantages of not being arbitrary in dening specic symptom cut-o points for a diagnosis, they
allow for retaining information on those patients who just miss the cut-o point for a diagnosis (and could,
therefore, simply be classied as

not

having the disorder), and the dimensions are more exible than a

categorical diagnosis. More importantly than just speculating on advantages and disadvantages, however,
is that the majority of empirical data seems to support the dimensional approach (Widiger & Frances,
1994). For example, borderline personality disorder patients do not show a specic prole on the MMPI, but
rather a nonspecic elevation across most scales. Diagnosis is typically made following a clinical evaluation
including an interview. A similar challenge faces clinicians using the NEO-PI (the assessment tool specically
designed for the FFM), but useful and relevant data are available from looking at the specic trait scores
within factors, particularly within the factor neuroticism (Trull & McCrae, 1994). In addition, factor analysis
on the dimensions of personality disorder yielded results that t very well with the FFM, with several aspects
of personality disorder (but not all) again being linked to neuroticism (Schroeder, Wormworth, & Livesley,
1994). It is important to remember, however, that the very idea of using a dimensional approach is based,
in part, on an assumption:

. . .If

one assumes that disordered personality is qualitatively dierent from normal personality, then the

inclusion of a dimensional model of personality may be insucient or inappropriate for investigation.

If

one assumes that disordered personality reects quantitative dierences in the manifestation or severity of
normal personality traits (i.e., a dimensional approach), then the adoption of a personality taxonomy for use
as a structural referent becomes a necessary or even fundamental conceptual task. (pp. 73-74; Wiggins &
Pincus, 1994)
What, then, might personality disorders look like in terms of a dimensional description? Clark, Vorhies,
and McEwen (1994) take an integrated approach based on two basic propositions pertaining to traits: rst,
that they are continuously distributed and exhibit wide individual variation; and second, that they are
not xed, but rather they are adaptations to the environment that are consistent within one's individual
range.

These two points lead to the notions that a single trait structure can represent both normal and

abnormal personality, that within the normal range there is great individual dierence in each person's
characteristic and adaptive styles of thinking, feeling, and behaving, and that personality disorders are
characterized by extreme and inexible expressions of the normal personality structure. When examining
data from individuals diagnosed with personality disorder, they have identied symptom clusters that form
dimensions, or factors, which once again t well with the FFM (Clark, et al., 1994). Widiger and several
colleagues have actually oered ve-factor translations of the standard categories of DSM-III and DSM-IV
personality disorders (see Widiger, et al., 1994). The purpose of these translations is to take the personality
disorder categories that psychologists are familiar with and put them in terms of the FFM. Consider two
examples:

Paranoid Personality Disorder: Paranoid personality disorder (PAR) involves interpreting the actions of others as threatening or deliberately demeaning. These individuals tend to be suspicious, mistrustful,
hypervigilant, and argumentative. According to the FFM, PAR is characterized primarily by excessively low
agreeableness, particularly on the suspiciousness facet (a facet is one of the traits that makes up a factor).
They are also characterized by the low agreeableness facets of very low straightforwardness and compliance,
which represent the PAR tendencies to be secretive and oppositional. PAR is also characterized by the angry

CHAPTER 10. TRAIT THEORIES OF PERSONALITY

258

hostility facet of neuroticism, low extraversion, and low openness.

Antisocial Personality Disorder: Antisocial personality disorder (ATS) is characterized by irresponsible and antisocial behavior, and often involves criminal activity and a lack of regard for the rights of others.
Within the FFM, they score excessively low on conscientiousness and agreeableness (particularly low on the
facets of straightforwardness, altruism, compliance, and tendermindedness).

They score high on the neu-

roticism facets of hostility, anxiety, depression, and impulsivity. However, so-called successful psychopaths
may be characterized by very low levels of anxiety and self-consciousness.
(see Widiger, et al., 1994)
So, given the possibility of reconceptualizing personality disorders within the FFM, is it something
we should do?

Millon suggests that we view personality as the psychological equivalent of the body's

biological systems. Personality is, in this conception, a psychic system of structures and functions that lead
to characteristic patterns of thought, feeling, and behavior. These characteristics cannot be viewed as simply
normal or abnormal, since any specic element of the personality might be adaptive in one situation but
maladaptive in another. Thus, the dimensional approach to describing personality provides a comprehensive
picture in which little information of potential signicance is lost (Millon, 1994). McCrae questions the very
validity of Axis II of the

DSM

system, which appears to have little empirical support.

He suggests that

clinicians include in their diagnosis of patients a global assessment of the ve personality factors.

Thus,

the diagnostic report would provide the necessary information on personality pertaining to the common
symptoms and problems associated with either high or low scores on each factor (McCrae, 1994; Widiger,
1994). For example:

High Neuroticism: chronic negative aects, diculty in inhibiting impulses, irrational beliefs
Low Neuroticism: lack of appropriate concern for potential problems in health or social adjustment,
emotional blandness

High Agreeableness: gullibility, excessive candor and generosity, inability to stand up to others, easily
taken advantage of

Low Agreeableness: cynicism and paranoid thinking, inability to trust, quarrelsomeness, too ready
to pick ghts, exploitative and manipulative, lying, rude and inconsiderate
(see McCrae, 1994)
Perhaps the most valuable aspect of any model used for classifying the personality disorders is its ability
to provide guidelines for conceptualizing a treatment strategy. Sanderson and Clarkin (1994) have indeed
found the NEO-PI useful in dierential treatment planning. For example, the NEO-PI, in conjunction with
a clinical interview, helps describe the typical interpersonal patterns of the patient, suggesting areas of difculty needing treatment regardless of whether the therapy format is individual, family, or a group setting.
In addition, the NEO-PI can help to identify which therapy format might be best suited to each particular
patient. Although Sanderson and Clarkin (1994) caution that such conceptions still await empirical conrmation, they do oer some examples from their own supportive clinical experience. Likewise, MacKenzie (1994)
oers numerous specic examples from cases in which factor scores provided clear target areas for focusing
therapy. For example, a women who scored high in agreeableness acknowledged that she repeatedly got into
relationships in which she felt used, a teacher who scored very high on openness was overly stimulated in
new situations and felt overwhelmed with creative ideas, and a man who scored low on conscientiousness
felt stuck in life, having worked only itinerant construction jobs despite having earned a graduate degree
in college. In each case, the NEO-PI data matched the clinical presentation quite well, suggesting that the
FFM would indeed be an eective conceptualization of treatment strategies for personality disorder issues
(as well as, presumably, for other psychological and adjustment disorders).
The diagnosis of personality disorders, whether categorical or dimensional, remains a controversial topic.
Of even greater concern, is the resistance of these disorders to treatment. However, the FFM appears to
oer an advantageous way of describing personality disorder as an extreme extension of normal personality
dimensions, and the NEO-PI scales oer practical direction with regard to treatment strategies. Change,
however, may not come easily:

10.1 Review of Key Points
•
•

Allport's approach to the study of personality emphasized the individual above all else.
In dening personality, Allport proposed a dynamic interaction between traits and how they aect the
individual's adjustment to his or her environment.

•

Allport dened traits as neuropsychic systems that had the eect of rendering dierent aspects of the
environment as the same, thus guiding behavior in consistent ways (in keeping with the traits, not the
environment per se).

•

Individual traits provide the basis for an idiographic approach to personality, whereas common traits
relate more to the nomothetic approach.

•

Each person's unique personality is inuenced by their dispositions. An individual can be inuenced
by cardinal, central, or secondary dispositions.

•

As the various stages of development inuence one's personality, the unique sense of me or I that
develops should be referred to as the proprium, according to Allport.

•

An adult's motives are independent of their development, something Allport referred to as functional
autonomy.

•

Allport proposed six aspects of a mature personality:

an extended sense of self, personal warmth,

emotional security, realistic perceptions, insight and humor, and a unifying philosophy of life.

•

In addition to personality tests, Allport valued the observation of expressive behavior and the review
of personal documents (when available).

•

Allport was a deeply spiritual man, emphasizing the positive role that religion can play in peoples'
lives.

•

Allport's personal faith, and his lifelong commitment to social ethics, led him to write one of the most
signicant works on prejudice ever published.

•

Cattell distinguished between traits and types, the latter being a broader term. Similarly, he distinguished between source traits and surface traits, respectively.

•

Using factor analysis, Cattell settled on sixteen factors, or source traits.

He developed the 16-PF

Questionnaire to measure these factors in individuals.

•

Cattell helped to establish the eld of psychometry, emphasizing the need for L-data, Q-data, and
T-data.

•

About the same time as Erikson, Cattell oered a lifespan theory of personality development.

He

proposed six stages: infancy, childhood, adolescence, maturity, middle age, and old age.

•

Eysenck used a second-order factor analysis to identify three superfactors: extraversion, neuroticism,
and psychoticism.

•

In support of his belief in the biological/evolutionary basis for personality, Eysenck joined Harry Harlow
in demonstrating that monkeys appear to have three similar factors underlying their personalities.

•

Some authors have suggested that Eysenck overstated the role of genetics, even based on his own data.
Eysenck acknowledged such concerns, and hopefully anticipated future research that might help clarify
the issue.

•

Eysenck, like Allport, was interested in practical applications of personality research. He also addressed
a wide variety of controversial topics that have, at best, highly questionable evidence supporting them.

•

Costa and McCrae expanded on Eysenck's theory, and proposed ve superfactors: extraversion, neuroticism, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness.

•

They also developed the NEO-PI-R to measure these factors. The NEO-PI-R has proven robust across
cultures, and research using the NEO-PI-R has supported the universality of the Five-Factor Model.

•

Despite arguments to the contrary, the majority of research shows that personality, as measured by

trait theories, is highly consistent throughout adulthood.

•

Zuckerman identied a sensation seeking trait, comprised of four aspects: thrill and adventure seeking,
experience seeking, disinhibition, and boredom susceptibility.

•

Zuckerman oered an alternative to the Five-Factor Model, which is quite similar, but more applicable
to a wider variety of species.

Once again, this supports a genetic/evolutionary perspective on the

development of personality.

Biology and Personality

During the evolution of the human species, we appear to have lost the ability to rely on instinctive behavior
as we developed extraordinary abilities to learn and adapt to the conditions facing us in our environment. In
addition, we can pass on that learning to other members of our social group. This is the basis for culture, and
the success of the human species is a testament to the advantages of this approach to survival. However, this
transition from instinct to learning and culture has not resulted in the elimination of biological inuences on
our behavior. Certain groups of people, usually a minority of the population, retain biological predispositions
to behave and react in certain distinct ways. To a lesser extent, all of us have some degree of these biological
predispositions.
The purpose of the rst half of this chapter is to examine those biological predispositions that are directly
reected in aspects of individual personality. In the second half of the chapter, we will examine the connection
between the mind and the body, and some of the ways in which individuals train the mind/body connection
in order to achieve a more balanced and healthy lifestyle.
Over 2,500 years ago, Gotama Buddha came to a fascinating understanding of the human mind. The
Buddha taught a series of

mindfulness exercises to train the mind, and these mindfulness exercises form

the basis for many styles of meditations. Today, cutting-edge neurobiologists are using functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) and other brain imaging techniques to examine brain activity during deep meditation. The goal of these studies is to understand the nature of the human mind, and to examine whether
the Buddha (as well as the Rishis and Yogis of ancient India) had discovered a way to actually alter the
state of the mind. However, too much time spent in meditation can lead to a weak body. So, the founder
of Zen Buddhism, Bodhidharma, when he arrived at the Shao-Lin temple, developed techniques of physical
training to strengthen the monks and to help them both defend themselves from bandits and prepare for
extended periods of meditation. This was the legendary beginning of the martial arts, formal techniques to
train the body and mind.

Since the martial arts were developed with noble goals, they have throughout

their history had a reputation for developing strong, admirable character traits. In other words, those who
practice martial arts with proper discipline also train themselves to conform to a personality style marked
by a calm, humble, yet condent demeanor.

Placing Biological and Mind/Body Theories of Personality in Context:
Testing Personality Theories Across the Full Range of Human History
This chapter has the broadest context of any chapter in this book. Some 2,500 years ago, Gotama Buddha
presented what can be considered the rst psychological theory, a theory on the nature of the human mind
and how one can work to control it in a mindful way. Doing so can help to lead one toward a more peaceful life,
both individually and in relation to others. Today, neurobiologists using cutting edge technology are trying to
determine what actually happens to the state of the human mind during the techniques of meditation taught
by the Buddha. In addition, the usefulness of meditation and mindfulness in psychotherapy is a popular
area of clinical practice and research, as well as a means toward enhancing the cross-cultural perspectives of

psychology in general.
Wilhelm Reich, a student and highly respected colleague of Sigmund Freud, was one of the rst Western
psychologists to consider the connection between body and mind as essential for psychology health. According
to Reich, we can be psychologically healthy only if we are able to fully express and satisfy our biological,
sexual needs. Reich devoted his career to helping individuals do just that, and in recognizing the role of the
body, he anticipated the eld of sociobiology. Sociobiology addresses the ways in which our behavior might
have been shaped by evolution. In other words, behaviors are naturally selected if they provide an advantage
for our genetic reproduction (having children, grandchildren, etc.).
Whereas Reich and the sociobiologists focus on the expression and pursuit of our biological desires,
Eastern tradition taught ways to train the body and mind to control these desires.

Indeed, the Buddha

taught that through mindfulness training we could detach ourselves from these needs, and live a life in which
we acknowledge desires, but feel no attachment to them. Such mental discipline, however, requires practice.
As monks became physically weak from spending all their time meditating, the founder of Zen Buddhism,
Bodhidharma, developed the rst formal techniques of Kung Fu.

Since the martial arts arose out of the

desire to remain healthy during meditation practice, they have always been associated with a spirituality
devoted to nonviolence and mental discipline.
The popularity of martial arts, meditation, Yoga, and a variety of Eastern philosophies and practices in
the United States today tells us that there is a strong interest in combing the traditions of East and West.
The interest of cognitive neuroscientists in the brain's changes during meditation shows us that Eastern
philosophy need not stand in opposition to our tradition of formal scientic inquiry in the West. And so,
Buddhist mindfulness, somatic psychology, behavior genetics, sociobiology, evolutionary psychology, and the
martial arts all seem to t together as a grand theory of the nature of body and mind and their inherent
connection.

11.1 Biology and Personality
When talking about the role of biology in behavior, the natural starting point is the genetic makeup of
each person. Our specic genetic blueprint is what distinguishes each of us as a unique individual, except
for identical twins. However, since humans no longer rely on instinctive behavior, there are no aspects of
personality that are specically determined by genetics.

Instead, it is more appropriate to say that our

genetic makeup determines ranges within which we might develop, and our environment then determines
where we fall within that range.

The topics of greatest interest in the biology of personality are those

topics that appear to be under a relatively greater inuence of genetics than environment. But how do we
determine the relative contributions of genetics and environment? Psychologists have relied mostly on twin
and adoption studies.

Twin Studies, Adoption Studies, Family Studies
Twin studies have a long and interesting history in the eld of psychology. Sir Francis Galton (18221911) studied mental abilities and is recognized as being the rst to utilize twin studies. His use of identical
twins, in the mid to late 1800s, is generally recognized as the rst use of an experimental control group
(Diamond, 1977/1997; Jensen, 1998), and the use of identical vs. fraternal twins continues to be recognized
as a natural control condition by psychologists and sociobiologists (Kagan, Kearsley, & Zelazo, 1978; Wilson,
1978). Twin studies were also of interest to psychologists in the former Soviet Union (Cole & Maltzman,
1969). While Anna Freud and Melanie Klein were applying psychoanalysis to the study and treatment of
children, the American physician and psychologist Arnold Gesell was comparing the achievement of fundamental developmental milestones between twins (Lomax, Kagan, & Rosencrantz, 1978), and Wayne Dennis
was conducting an astonishing experiment on a pair of twins. Dennis and his wife raised the twins under
conditions of minimal social and sensory stimulation. This research had a noble goal: to understand the basis
for the detrimental eects of institutionalized care that was being recognized in overcrowded orphanages.
However, one of the twins ended up showing signs of mental retardation (though this was attributed to an
early head injury; Lomax, Kagan, & Rosencrantz, 1978).

Obviously such an experiment would never be

approved today, due to the ethical guidelines and oversight that have become a common part of psycho-

263

logical research, but twin studies done in reasonable and ethical ways continue to be an important part of
psychological research.
What makes identical twins important is that they share 100 percent of their genetic material, whereas
fraternal twins (like any other siblings) share an average of 50 percent of their genetic material. By extending
this to families, and nally to people who have no biological relationship, we have a continuum of genetic
relatedness from complete to none.

This allows us to address the issue of

heritability, or the degree of

individual variance on some measure of behavior or personality that can be attributed to genetics.

It is

important to remember, however, that heritability is measured in populations (see Kagan, 1994; Sternberg,
Grigorenko, & Kidd, 2005).

It makes no sense to suggest, for example, that a 5-foot tall person is 54

inches tall due to genetics and then grew another 6 inches thanks to good nutrition.

Adoption studies

add an interesting twist to this research, since adopted children take the genetic contributions of their
parents into dierent environmental situations, making adoption studies a useful tool for comparing the
environmental contributions to the genetic contributions. However, these studies remain challenging. For
example, intelligence is perhaps the most widely studied trait in terms of whether and how much it is
genetic. Some of this research has been very controversial. Sir Francis Galton, who was mentioned above,
believed that his research conrmed that certain races were superior to others, and that superior races had
an obligation to selectively breed their best individuals for the good of future generations, as had been done
(and continues to be done today) with certain breeds of dogs and horses (Galton, 1869/1997). Despite this
controversial beginning to the study of genetics and intelligence, the topic has remained widely studied, but
elusive nonetheless. Estimates on the heritability of intelligence range from approximately 65 to 85 percent
(Gould, 1982; Jensen, 1998). However, at very early ages the genetic and environmental inuences are closer
to 50-50, decrease with age, and by adulthood the genetic component is almost entirely responsible for the
correlation of intelligence between related individuals (Gould, 1982; Jensen, 1998). Further complicating the
situation for studying children, when a wider range of extended family members are considered and cultural
factors are separated from non-transmissible environmental factors, it appears that genetics, culture, and
environment all play roughly equal roles (Boyd & Richerson, 1985).

Indeed, culture can have profound

eects on intelligence, including our denition of intelligence itself (Sternberg, 2004). Finally, returning to
the controversial perspective of Galton and other proponents of the

eugenics movement (the belief that

superior races and classes should not mix with inferior groups), research today has demonstrated that no
legitimate connection can be made between race and intelligence (Sternberg, Grigorenko, & Kidd, 2005; also
see Loehlin, 1997; Williams & Ceci, 1997), and when it comes to education, IQ isn't even the best predictor
of academic performance (Duckworth & Seligman, 2005).
Another important point is the issue of

family studies. Usually, we think of the family as providing

genetic similarity, since children inherit their genes from their parents. Second, we tend to think that families
provide a common environmental situation for each of their children, particularly in small families. However,
this is not always true. In the Russian literature there was a well-known case in which the rst-born girl was
always treated as the elder sister, even though her younger identical twin was only minutes younger. The
result of the dierential treatment was that the older girl reached most developmental milestones before
her sister (Bozhovich, 1969). In a case described by the renowned Russian neuropsychologist A. R. Luria,
identical twins with retarded speech had begun to develop their own autonomous language. Once separated
into dierent classes in nursery school, however, the autonomous language disappeared (Luria, 1969). Thus,
the family can have a very dramatic environmental inuence, whether intentional or not, that goes against
the genetic similarity due to biological relationships or even identical twinship. What then, can we conclude
regarding the heritability of personality traits in humans? Certainly genetic factors play an important role,
but the complexity of the human organism and its sociocultural environment makes it dicult to draw
denite conclusions about exactly how much of an inuence our unique genetic prole has on our individual
personality. Nonetheless, psychologists have continued to pursue this important question.

Genetically Determined Dispositions
Behavior genetics is the term most commonly used to refer to studies on the inuence of genetics on
behavior. Most of these studies have relied on comparing identical twins to fraternal twins, other siblings,
and unrelated individuals, including when possible twins who have been reared apart. These studies are often

conducted in European countries that have thorough records of family histories, but one major, longitudinal
study ongoing here in the United States has been the Minnesota Twin Family Study conducted at the
University of Minnesota since 1983. These various sources of data, in addition to other research procedures,
have helped psychologists come to some understanding of the role played by genetics in determining behavior
and personality.
Psychologist Jerome Kagan is well known for his early studies on the nature of

temperament. Temper-

ament is perhaps the most salient characteristic of personality. It has been loosely described as the emotional
component of our personality, as stable behavioral and emotional reactions that appear early in life and are
inuenced by genetic factors (Kagan, 1994). Kagan further describes temperamental categories as qualities
that (1) vary among individuals, (2) are moderately stable over time and in dierent situations, (3) are partly
determined by genetics, and (4) appear early in life. In part because they were easy to observe, the most
popular temperamental qualities that have been studied are activity, irritability, and fearfulness, or as Kagan
describes them: watchful inhibition vs. fearless exploration. About 10 percent of children exhibit extreme
inhibition to nonthreatening, but unfamiliar, events (Kagan, 1984). Although this behavior can seemingly
be altered by parental inuence, subtle signs of the behavioral inhibition can be seen as the child grows, and
they tend to continue into adulthood. Similarly, with uninhibited children, it is extremely unlikely that they
will ever become inhibited children. Further studies on twins have helped to conrm that being inhibited or
outgoing is inuenced by genetics (Kagan, Kearsley, & Zelazo, 1978). Similar results have also been found
with Guatemalan and Chinese children (Kagan, Kearsley, & Zelazo, 1978). As important as our emotional
reactions are (see, e.g., the work of Daniel Goleman, 1995, 1998), they still do not necessarily dominate our
personality:

Figure 11.1

265

An even temperament leads to stable behavioral and emotional reactions.
. . .it is wise to state explicitly that many dierences among children may have little to
temperament. . .Our current knowledge indicates that the motivation to perform well in school,

do with
the will-

ingness to help a friend, loyalty to family, tolerance toward others, and a host of other motives and beliefs
are minimally inuenced by temperament. (pg. 77; Kagan, 1994)
Recently, Thomas Bouchard, Jr.
traits.

(2004) oered a concise review of the heritability of psychological

With regard to the Big Five personality traits, they all exhibit heritability in the range of 42

to 57 percent.

If one considers the alternative known as the Big Three, the range is 44 to 52 percent

(Bouchard, 2004). Thus, genetics make a signicant contribution to the nature of basic personality, but at
the same time there is at least as much of an environmental contribution (though that certainly includes
a variety of factors). There is also signicant heritability of psychological interests (such as being realistic,
artistic, social, etc.), social attitudes, and psychiatric illness (especially schizophrenia; Bouchard, 2004; see
also Bouchard, 1994; Bouchard & McGue, 1990; Bouchard et al., 1990; Kety, 1975; Mendlewicz, Fleiss, &
Fieve, 1975; Shields, Heston, & Gottesman, 1975). Even such complex personality variables as well-being,
traditionalism, religiosity, and criminality have been found to be highly inuenced by our genetic makeup (Crowe, 1975; Kagan, 1994; Kessler, 1975; Tellegen et al., 1988; Waller et al., 1990). To put it simply,
virtually all psychological factors are signicantly inuenced by our genetic makeup, but none are specically
determined by genetics. This led Danielle Dick and Richard Rose (2002) to question whether the eld of
behavior genetics has completed what it can reasonably hope to accomplish. They argue that there is much
more to be studied, particularly in the area of

gene-environment interactions. In such interactions,

individuals experience the same environment in dierent ways due to their genetic predispositions.
In

Galen's Prophecy,

Kagan (1994) describes the role that he believes the

amygdala plays in mediating

responses to anxiety-producing stimuli. Eight percent of children demonstrate highly reactive responses to
such stimuli, which animal research has shown is associated with increased activity in the amygdala and,
consequently, a

behavioral inhibition system. As a result, these children either freeze or withdraw from

unfamiliar people and situations. In other words, they seem shy and withdrawn. Approximately 18 percent
of children demonstrate low reactivity, their amygdala and the behavioral inhibition system are not activated,
and they are likely to approach unfamiliar people and situations with curiosity. These simple patterns of
behavior can have profound eects on personality. Kagan (1994) has found that

high reactive infants,

those who become anxious as a result of unfamiliarity, tend to become dour, serious, and fearful as they
grow. In contrast, the

low reactive infants, those who may respond to unfamiliarity with curiosity and

interest, become more joyful and fearless as they grow up.

However, these tendencies are by no means

guarantees, because the environment plays a signicant role. If mothers are rm and set strict limits on the
child's behavior, if they are supportive but do not always hold the child when it is upset (i.e., they hold the
child when it

needs

help, but not when the child does

not need

help), then a high reactive child has a much

better chance of overcoming its tendency to become an anxious and withdrawn person. One explanation,
according to Kagan, is that these mothers require their children to meet her socialization demands; they
must learn to deal with the uncertainty of unfamiliar situations. As for overprotective parents:

. . .It

appears that mothers who protect their high reactive infants from frustration and anxiety in the

hope of eecting a benevolent outcome seem to exacerbate the infant's uncertainty and produce the opposite
eect.

This result is in greater accord with the old-fashioned behavioristic view than with the modern

emphasis on the infant's need for a sensitive parent. (pg. 205; Kagan, 1994)
In support of Kagan's studies, Fox and his colleagues have demonstrated a specic gene-environment
interaction that predicts behavioral inhibition in children aged 14 and 84 months (young 1 year-olds and
7 year-olds; Fox et al., 2005). Although it is dicult to describe such studies in simple terms, suce it to
say that children with a combination of the short 5-HTT allele (a gene for the molecule that transports the
neurotransmitter serotonin) and low social support are at an increased risk for behavioral inhibition. When
the children were 1 year old, behavioral inhibition was measured in terms of the latency to approach novel
objects and unfamiliar adults, and when the children were 7 years old it was measured in terms of their
disconnection from a group of children at play. The short allele of the 5-HTT gene has been associated with
increased anxiety, negative emotionality, and relatively strong coupling with the amygdala. Therefore, in the

absence of social support, children with the short allele are more likely to experience stress in the presence
of novelty and strangers (Fox et al., 2005). Mott, Caspi, and Rutter have written an excellent review of
how psychologists and other scientists approach this important new eld of gene-environment interactions,
and in that review they suggest that it is most likely that such interactions are common in psychopathology
(Mott et al., 2006).

Discussion Question: Jerome Kagan studied temperament, and found that approximately 10% of
children are shy and inhibited and approximately 20 percent of children are curious and adventurous, and
these temperaments are most likely to continue into adulthood. Consider the people you know. Have their
basic temperaments remained constant throughout their lives? What about you?

Sociobiology and Evolutionary Inuences on Behavior
Sociobiology is a relatively new eld of study that applies evolutionary biology to social behavior
(Barash, 1977; Wilson, 1975). Although much of the research underlying sociobiology has been conducted
with non-human animals, the value of this research and its applications to understanding human behavior
and personality should not be underestimated. Samuel Gosling and his colleagues have demonstrated that
a wide variety of other animal species have personality traits similar to those of humans (Gosling, 2001;
Gosling & John, 1999; Gosling, Kwan, & John, 2003; Gosling & Vazire, 2002; Jones & Gosling, 2005; Mehta
& Gosling, 2006). When the

ethologists Nikolaas Tinbergen, Konrad Lorenz, and Karl von Frisch shared

the Nobel Prize in 1973 it was the rst Nobel Prize awarded for the study of behavior. Sociobiology, a eld
similar to ethology, has oered valuable new perspectives on human behavior, perspectives on behaviors that
do not always seem logical at rst. As an aside, sociobiology also allows us to address an exciting variety of
human behaviors, including the apparent evolutionary and neurobiological bases for laughter (see Panksepp,
2005).
The fundamental concept underlying sociobiology is that of

inclusive tness. Inclusive tness refers

to the advantages of behaviors that increase the likelihood of an individual's genetic survival through the
survival of genetically related

kin (Barash, 1977; Wilson, 1975). Therefore, in looking at the evolution

of human social behavior, we must not consider only the ways in which behaviors contribute to individual
survival (which is a traditional Darwinian perspective on survival of the ttest), but rather on how behaviors
contribute to the survival of our children, family, and perhaps even our community.
Sociobiologists have looked at several major topics regarding the evolution of human behavior, but we will
only take a brief look at three behaviors: mate selection, parenting, and religion. In Chapter 2 we discussed
male/female dierences as a matter of fact.

This has become commonly accepted in the popular media,

and evidence suggests that men and women are inclined to essentialize their dierences (Prentice & Miller,
2006). In contrast, Janet Shibley Hyde has provided compelling evidence that men and women are actually
much more alike than they are dierent (Hyde, 1996, 2005; also see Spelke, 2005; Stewart & McDermott,
2004). So which is it? When it comes to mate selection, sociobiology suggests that men and women should
be dierent, because the roles they will need to play in eventual child rearing require them to be dierent.
It is a biological fact that men need to contribute very little to the birth of a child, whereas women become
pregnant for nine months and, from an evolutionary perspective, must then breast-feed the child for one or
two years. Thus, a man can improve his inclusive tness by seeking multiple relationships with women in
their prime child-bearing years and exhibiting physical characteristics indicative of good reproductive health.
Unfortunately, other men are looking for the same women, so competition can become erce. Women, on the
other hand, should be inclined to seek men who have already won those competitions, demonstrating that
they can provide and protect resources for their ospring, usually by commanding a territory or a privileged
place in society (Barash, 1977; Wilson, 1975, 1978). So it is not uncommon for women to be inclined to
marry older men, particularly men who are above them on the socioeconomic scale (Barash, 1977). Women
would also be inclined to select men who make some commitment in terms of child rearing (Barash, 1979).
So, men who were inclined to make only the minimum commitment necessary to the sexual act did not
improve their inclusive tness, since they were not selected by discriminating females.
When parenting is discussed in introductory psychology courses, the most common topic is parenting
styles and their inuence on personality development. In sociobiology, however, the most relevant issues are
the survival of the ospring and how taxing it is on the parents to help their ospring survive. We are just

267

beginning to understand some aspects of the biological basis for attachment from the ospring's perspective
(Hofer, 2006), but understanding the attachment of the parent to the ospring remains elusive. Obviously,
raising a child requires a considerable amount of eort on the parent's part, but typically more on the part
of the mother. Thus, close social bonding is important, and this may form the basis of love as an added
emotional component to sex, as well as the growing love that parents feel for their children (Barash, 1977;
Wilson, 1978).

Older women are particularly more sensitive to the needs of rst-born children, since the

child may well represent the only opportunity for the mother to reproduce.

Nature is full of well-known

examples of female animals vigorously defending their young, even if their own life is endangered (Barash,
1977, 1979).

Of peculiar interest is the behavior of grandparents, since a parent is really only successful

in reproducing if they eventually become grandparents. Barash (1977) discusses two interesting situations.
When a child is born, it is most likely that the mother's parents come to help. But if a young couple chooses
to live with parents, it is most likely the father's parents. These may simply seem to be cultural artifacts, but
they have a basis in biological tness. Only a mother can be sure that she has made a genetic contribution
to a child (at least in the past, when our behaviors were evolving). So, when a woman has a baby, only her
parents are sure that they have become grandparents. The man's parents serve their own interests best if
they can watch over the woman, to make sure that she does not stray from her relationship with their son
(Barash, 1977). All of this may sound cold and calculating, but it is logical nonetheless, and if we believe in
an unconscious mind, then people don't need to be aware of exactly what they are doing.
Religion has been a profound inuence throughout the history of the human species. It has been suggested
that children naturally seek a divine explanation for the existence of a world they cannot comprehend
(Kelemen, 2004). According to sociobiologist E. O. Wilson:
The predisposition to religious belief is the most complex and powerful force in the human mind and in
all probability an ineradicable part of human nature. . .It is one of the universals of social behavior, taking
recognizable form in every society from hunter-gatherer band to socialist republics. . .At Shanidar, Iraq, sixty
thousand years ago, Neanderthal people decorated a grave with seven species of owers having medicinal
and economic value, perhaps to honor a shaman. Since that time, according to the anthropologist Anthony
F. C. Wallace, mankind has produced on the order of 100 thousand religions. (pg. 169; Wilson, 1978).
But what evolutionary advantage might religion serve? This question is dicult to answer, in part because
religion appears to be unique to the human species. Many of the principles of sociobiology were determined
by working with lower animals, especially the social insects. Without other species to use for comparison,
it is not easy to understand our own species. According to Wilson, the best avenue for understanding the
advantage conferred by religion to inclusive tness is the ability to conform to the expectations of society.
Humans seem to seek indoctrination.

As we became more intelligent, more capable of making individual

choices, perhaps we evolved the behavioral predispositions necessary to continue remaining within our tribe.
As a result, the rules and rituals that developed to codify this behavior enhance the survival of our group,
and it is this group-selection that sociobiologists recognize as the evolutionary advantage resulting from
religion (Boyd & Richerson, 1985; Wilson, 1975, 1978). This is not unlike the role ascribed to religion by
Sigmund Freud, except that sociobiologists propose an underlying genetic basis, whereas Freud proposed an
underlying psychodynamic basis.
One of the most common negative reactions to sociobiology is resistance to the idea that we are still
animals being driven by our genes and evolution. The simple logic provided by sociobiologists, and the clear
parallels between human behavior and the behavior of other animals is not enough to sway the minds of
some people. Culture denitely plays a signicant role in our lives, gene-culture co-evolution may underlie
human cooperation and altruism (Henrich, et al., 2006), and separating genetics from culture on a topic such
as mate selection is dicult (Buss, 2003; Miller, Putcha-Bhagavatula, & Pedersen, 2002).
something dierent than evolution? Richard Dawkins, in his profound book

But is culture

The Selsh Gene

(1976), has

proposed that the human mind has evolved to a point where it can create self-replicating units of culture,
which he called

memes. Memes can be transmitted from person to person, and they can evolve faster than

genes. Thus, human culture has been able to outpace genetic evolution, creating many of the challenges we
face today when we try to separate culture from genetics in order to understand complex human behaviors.
As examples, let us consider two potential memes: belief in God, and belief in life after death. As mentioned

above, children appear to be inclined to believe in a supernatural creator of the world that they, as children,
simply cannot understand. And religion is a cultural universal. Not every religion, however, believes in life
after death, and even fewer believe in heaven or hell.

So religion appears to be a very successful meme,

whereas belief in life after death is somewhat less successful, but successful enough to still be prevalent. One
of the most fascinating aspects of memes is that they may actually increase the likelihood that you can have
a very long lasting eect on the world. As Dawkins points out, Queen Elizabeth II of England is a direct
descendant of William the Conqueror, but the odds are very low that she has even a single gene descended
from him. So, immortality cannot really be achieved through reproduction:
But if you contribute to the world's culture, if you have a good idea, compose a tune, invent a sparking
plug, write a poem, it may live on, intact, long after your genes have dissolved in the common pool. Socrates
may or may not have a gene or two alive in the world today. . .but who cares?

The meme-complexes of

Socrates, Leonardo, Copernicus, and Marconi are still going strong. (pg. 214; Dawkins, 1976)

Discussion Question: According to Richard Dawkins, the true path to immortality is found through
cultural contributions to society, by virtue of cultural units he called memes. What memes do you think are
important in your life and in your community? Has that changed during your life and, if so, why?

Evolutionary Psychology
The eld of

evolutionary psychology is a direct application of sociobiology to psychology, and appears

to have begun with the publication of

The Adapted Mind

(Barkow et al., 1992). In this landmark book, a

collection of authors were brought together with the purpose of addressing three major premises: (1) that
there is a universal human nature, but that it is based on evolved psychological mechanisms as opposed to
culture, (2) that these psychological mechanisms were adaptations constructed by natural selection, and (3)
that these adaptations t the way of life of our ancient ancestors, and may not t our modern circumstances.
Similar to the sociobiologists, evolutionary psychologists examine how evolution shaped human behavior and
cognition in ways that helped individuals to pass on their genes to future generations, covering topics such
as cooperation, mate preference, parental care, the development of language and perceptual abilities, the
individual need to belong, helping and altruism, and the universality of emotions (Barkow et al., 1992; Buss,
1999; Larsen & Buss, 2005).
One of the best known psychologists studying evolutionary phenomena is David Buss, and he has paid
particular attention to how we choose and attempt to keep our mates. In

The Evolution of Desire,

Buss

(2003) describes how biological dierences between males and females leads to dierent mating strategies,
and that this should lead to inevitable conict. Thus, according to Buss, conict in a marriage is the norm,
not the result of choosing the wrong person. As a result of this conict, and for a variety of reasons underlying
it, the possibility always exists that a man or woman in a marriage (or other committed relationship) will
engage in other sexual relationships outside of the marriage. In order to defend against this potential loss
of a committed mate, it was an advantage for people to evolve the emotion of jealousy. In

Passion,

The Dangerous

Buss (2000b) argues that jealousy is just as important as love and sex. Passion is necessary for us

to have motivation (consider Jung's description of the shadow archetype). But with jealousy:

. . .Jealousy

can keep a couple committed or drive a man to savagely beat his wife. An attraction to a

neighbor's spouse can generate intoxicating sexual euphoria while destroying two marriages. (pg. 2; Buss,
2000b)
Indeed, the competition that accompanied the desire to obtain and hold onto a mate in our distant past
was so intense that we also evolved the psychological mechanisms necessary to kill people. Although this
psychological mechanism may be maladaptive in our society today, its eectiveness in the prehistoric past
remains hidden just below the surface of our minds. As a result, it can come out suddenly, explaining why
the majority of murderers seem to be normal individuals until the day they kill someone (often someone they
know and care about; Buss, 2005).
We have a tendency to think of things such as marital conict, marital indelity, jealousy, and murder as
abnormal situations. Evolutionary psychologists suggest instead that such behaviors are the result of natural
adaptations. However, as noted above, these adaptations were appropriate for our ancient ancestors, and
may not t within our society today (murder is illegal). Yet, these behaviors and emotions are common,
suggesting that we can't simply dismiss them. Since evolution typically takes a very long time, it is hard

to say whether dierent adaptations will occur in the future of our species, given the cultural changes that
have occurred through history. Perhaps the best we can hope for now is a continued development of our
understanding of personality, through a variety of theoretical perspectives.

Connections Across Cultures: The Somatic Psychology of Wilhelm Reich
Wilhelm Reich (1897-1957) was a respected student and colleague of Sigmund Freud, a political activist,
and eventually a convicted criminal in the United States whose books and journals were burned by the
American government. But he left behind a legacy of focusing on the body and mind as deeply interrelated.
In Germany in the 1930s, Reich devoted extraordinary eort to programs addressing sex education, sex
hygiene, access to birth control, etc. He gave up his psychoanalytic practice, because he felt that sex education
programs had the potential to be more helpful to more people by preventing sexual and psychological
diculties.

Despite the so-called sexual revolution of the 1960s, many of these issues still plague society

today. Reich's description of the phases involved in the experience of an organism (rst studied in the 1920s
and 1930s) anticipated the famous research of Masters and Johnson (1966), and incorporated a psychoanalytic
view of mindsets occurring during sexual activity (Reich, 1973). His work on

somatic psychology relates

to physical approaches to psychotherapy that continue today. These contributions and controversies earned
Reich a place in the marvelous history of the study of mental illness entitled

Masters of the Mind

(Millon,

2004).
Raised on a farm, Reich was interested in animal husbandry, and conducted extensive studies of animal
sexual behavior.

As a young child, he witnessed one of the family's maids having intercourse with her

boyfriend. When he asked the maid if he could play the lover, she obliged. When he was 12 years old, he
caught his mother having an aair with one of his tutors. In a classic example of the Oedipus complex, he
considered using the information to blackmail his mother into allowing him to have sexual intercourse with
her! Instead, he turned again to one of the family maids. He then told his father, whom Reich had witnessed
beating his mother in the past, and shortly thereafter his mother committed suicide. For the rest of his life,
Reich was tormented by the thought that he may have been responsible for his mother's death. His father
died when Reich was 17 years old, and Reich took over the family farm until it was destroyed in World War
I.
While attending medical school at the University of Vienna, Reich joined the Vienna Psychoanalytic
Society, where he began studying with Sigmund Freud. Reich and Freud were deeply impressed with one
another. Reich eventually held several important positions in Freud's training clinic, including Director of
the Seminar for Psychoanalytic Therapy, and his work on character analysis was widely respected. Indeed,
Reich was so involved with the society, Freud, and the clinic that many people thought of him as Freud's
pet (Higgins, 1973; Sharaf, 1983).
However, Reich fell out of favor with the psychoanalytic society. In 1930, he moved to Germany, joined
the communist party, and became active in a variety of sex education and sex hygiene programs. But the
communists opposed progressive sex education, because they hoped to gain the favor of the Catholic Church,
in opposition to the growing threat of the Nazis. Reich stepped right into this dangerous controversy, often
relating one particular story of how moved he was when a young pregnant girl sought his help, help she had
not received from the Hitler Youth (Sharaf, 1983). In 1933, he published

The Mass Psychology of Fascism,

a book subsequently banned by the Nazis (Reich, 1933/1970). Eventually, Reich was excluded from both
the Communist Party and the psychoanalytic society.
Reich left Germany for Denmark, and then moved to Norway, where his life and work began to take a
strange turn. He became convinced that he had discovered a primordial cosmic energy,

orgone energy,

which provided the underlying energy for all life. He believed that orgone energy streams created hurricanes
and galaxies.

He built orgone energy accumulators, and began studying how it might be used for such

diverse goals as treating cancer and controlling the weather. He was compelled to leave Norway, and in 1939
moved to the United States. Eventually, however, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) sought
an injunction in federal court to put an end to Reich's work on orgone energy. Reich refused to appear in
court, and the injunction was issued in default (see Greeneld, 1974). Reich was accused and found guilty
of criminal contempt, and sentenced to two years in federal prison.

The FDA destroyed much of Reich's

equipment, and burned tons of his papers and books. In 1957, Reich suered a heart attack and died in the

Federal Penitentiary at Lewisburg, Pennsylvania.

Somatic Psychology
Reich's psychoanalytic work emphasized three important topics: the intimate relationship between body
and mind, the character of the individual, and the value of precise diagnosis. By the 1920s, Freud and his
colleagues had stopped paying much attention to the concept of libido.

In contrast, Reich became more

and more interested in this sexual energy, which he associated directly with sexual activity. While working
with his patients, Reich was impressed by their descriptions of feeling an emptiness in their genitals. This
was an especially interesting point regarding women, since Reich himself considered the sexual inhibition
experienced by many women as something appropriate to their development. However, as Reich pursued
these ideas, he began to question the completeness and accuracy of Freud's theories. Reich developed what
became known as the

orgasm theory, and he proposed the concept of orgastic potency:

Orgastic potency is the capacity to surrender to the streaming of biological energy, free of any inhibitions;
the capacity to discharge completely the dammed-up sexual excitation through involuntary, pleasurable
convulsions of the body. . . (pg. 29; Reich, 1973)
Reich considered the ability to enjoy sexual release as a critical aspect of normal and healthy personal
development. This perspective demands a direct link between the body and the mind, since only through
physical satisfaction can psychological and emotional satisfaction be achieved.

When discussing neurotic

symptoms, he described orgastic impotence as the somatic core of the neurosis. . . (Reich, 1933/1972). To
further emphasize the point, Reich did not merely consider the

ability

to have meaningful sexual relations

as important, he believed that they needed regular satisfaction:

. . .I

maintain that every person who has succeeded in preserving a certain amount of naturalness knows

that those who are psychically ill need but one thing - complete and repeated sexual gratication. . . (pp. 23;
Reich, 1973)
Reich's most widely respected work within the psychoanalytic community centered on character analysis,
in which he emphasized

character armoring and character resistance. Both of these constructs can be

viewed as defense mechanisms, but they are deep and secondary fragmentations of the ego. Thus, they dene
the very character of the patient, and must be removed before traditional psychoanalysis can be eective. In
keeping with the term somatic psychology, Reich addressed the physical manifestation of character armoring
as

muscular armor. Individuals who are actively character armoring demonstrate what Reich described

as a chronic, frozen, muscular-like bearing. He believed that the visible muscular rigidity was the natural
consequence of inhibiting aggression, and that it could be understood on the basis of only one principle:
the armoring of the periphery of the biopsychic system (Reich, 1933/1972).

In other words, the body

physically responds to what the mind is doing; if the mind is defending itself, the body prepares to defend
itself. This muscular tension is by no means easy to remove. If the analyst tries to get the patient to relax,
the muscular tension is replaced by restlessness. Based on his theories, Reich described two basic types of
character: the

genital character and the neurotic character. The genital character refers to individuals

who are relatively healthy in terms of their psychological development, and their capacity to enjoy life is
uninhibited. The neurotic character is governed by rigid armor of both body and mind.
Many psychologists and a variety of practitioners in other areas have made the connection between
body and mind an important part of their studies and their lifestyle.

For example, we often talk with

our hands (Goldin-Meadow, 2006), forced stereotypic movement leads to stereotypic thoughts about others
(Mussweiler, 2006), young infants integrate their body movement and their attention (Robertson, Bacher,
& Huntington, 2001), physical movement is more important than visual information for eective navigation
(Ruddle & Lessels, 2006), and members of dierent cultures actually perceive the physical environment
in dierent ways (Miyamoto, Nisbett, & Masuda, 2006).

Yoga has become very popular in the United

States, particularly the physical aspect of Hatha Yoga, and Yoga practitioners talk about understanding and
respecting the body (e.g., Scaravelli, 1991; Stewart, 1994). This is particularly true as we age, since we all
die sooner or later, but what we must do is not allow the body to degenerate while living (Scaravelli, 1991).
Reich referred to a genetic dierentiation of character types and the genetic-dynamic theory of the character long before other psychologists were talking about the heritability of personality or gene-environment
interactions. Reich went on to say that the social and economic/political factors that play such an important

cultural role in personality development would not be as inuential as they are if not for the likelihood that
they must rst have impinged upon and changed human needs before these transformed drives and needs
could begin to have an eect as historical factors (Reich, 1932/1972). This sounds very much like sociobiology: the selection of behaviors, behaviors that are determined genetically, as adaptable to the relevant
human condition. If indeed this idea does reect the same basic premise as sociobiology, then Reich was
thinking about a new eld of research into human behavior that was still over 40 years in the future. In
his discussion of muscular armor, Reich referred to three primary emotions that inuence human behavior:
sexuality, anxiety, and anger or hate (Reich, 1932/1972). Gotama Buddha (who most people think of as

the

Buddha) described three root causes of human suering: desire, delusion, and hatred. What is sexuality but
the greatest desire in human life? According to sociobiologists, particularly Dawkins (1976), life is about
ensuring the propagation of individual genes, and in our case that means sexual reproduction. In addition,
both Reich and the Buddha acknowledged hatred as key, and Buddhists typically see hatred as the antithesis of desire. Thus, Wilhelm Reich, once regarded as Freud's pet, had incorporated both ancient Eastern
philosophies and the as-yet unknown eld of sociobiology into a cohesive theory of human character, while
still in his mid-thirties. One can only imagine what he might have accomplished had he not pursued the
odd theory of orgone energy, which led to his being ostracized and, ultimately, to the federal prison where
he died.

Discussion Question: Wilhelm Reich believed that an active and uninhibited sexual life was essential
for healthy development.

He also believed that one's ability to experience that healthy sexuality, their

orgastic potency, was in important measure of psychological health. Do you agree with this perspective, and
do you think society agrees with this perspective?

11.2 Ancient and Modern Approaches to Training the Mind/Body
Connection
Wilhelm Reichwas by no means the rst person to consider the connection between the body and the mind
as something of essential importance to understanding the nature of the human experience. Gotama Buddha
had developed just such a system approximately 500 years B.C. (see Chapter 17 for a more detailed discussion
of Buddhism). The Buddha did more, however, than simply describe the nature of the human mind. He
oered a few ways to begin quieting the mind, so that one could become a more peaceful, aware, and content
individual. In the following section, we will consider his four techniques of

Buddhism and Mindfulness

mindfulness meditation.

Andrew Olendzki (2003, 2005), a scholar of early Buddhist tradition and executive director of the Barre
Center for Buddhist Studies in Massachusetts, has done a marvelous job of trying to put the teachings of
the Buddha into a perspective understandable to Western psychologists. In

very

simple terms covering only

a small part of what the Buddha taught, when a sense object that we are capable of detecting is, indeed,
detected by one of our sensory systems, we become aware of the experience. For example, when a sound
is detected by our ear, we become aware of hearing a sound.
of each of these individual moments of

Consciousness is an emergent phenomenon

contact, i.e., the moment of contact between the sense object, the

sensory organ, and the awareness of the object. Since we are constantly encountering dierent moments of
contact that arise and then fall out of consciousness, from all of our various senses, the Buddhist concept
of consciousness is not a continuous one (this is in contrast to the stream of consciousness perspective of
America's preeminent psychologist William James).

Since consciousness is not continuous, neither is the

self. Our sense of self as continuous and real is an illusion, and it is because we cling to that illusion that we
inevitably suer (the rst noble truth in Buddhism). In order to alleviate our suering, and to understand
the true nature of our self, the Buddha taught a series of mindfulness meditations to help us see ourselves
as we really are.
There are four mindfulness trainings: mindfulness of body, mindfulness of feeling, mindfulness of mind, and mindfulness of mental objects (Olendzki, 2005; Thanissaro Bhikkhu, 1996). When
meditating mindfully on the body, it is common to focus on the breath.

This can be done in a variety

of positions: sitting, standing, lying down, or walking. One can also become very mindful of the body by
performing certain

martial arts as moving meditation, particularly Tai Chi Chuan or Qigong (Khor,

When meditating mindfully on feelings, one considers the pleasant or unpleasant quality of each

experience. For example, after sitting for a while, pain or discomfort may arise in a knee or hip. There is
nothing wrong with this pain, and with practice one can experience it as a sensation without the negative or
unpleasant feeling that we describe as pain. This is, of course, not easy. All forms of meditation require time
and practice. Still, it is important to remember that if there is a real problem, such sitting on a sharp rock,
you may want to move in a slow and mindful manner until comfortable again. When meditating mindfully
on the mind itself, one takes notice of the thoughts arising during meditation. One should pay particular
attention to whether the thoughts are related to one of the three root causes of suering: greed, hatred, or
delusion.

. . .In

any given moment, the mind is either caught up by one or more of these or it is not, and this is

something of which one can learn to be aware. Greed and hatred are the two polarities of desire, the intense
wanting or not wanting of an object, while delusion is a strong form of the basic misunderstanding that gives
desire its power over us. (pg. 255; Olendzki, 2005)
One does not pass judgment on these thoughts, mindfulness teaches us only to become aware of our
thoughts and to recognize their presence and reality.

Finally, there is mindfulness of mental objects (or

mental qualities), a deep understanding of the content of mental experience that arises as one masters
mindfulness meditation (Olendzki, 2005; Thanissaro Bhikkhu, 1996). Mindfulness of mental objects involves
focusing on the nature of desires as they arise in relation to the ve hindrances: desire, aversion, indolence,
restlessness and doubt.
This conservative and traditional understanding of mindfulness may seem rather esoteric, but it is proving
to be very inuential in psychology today. To be sure, meditation has been described as now one of the
most enduring, widespread, and researched of all psychotherapeutic methods (Walsh & Shapiro, 2006). A

mindfulness-based stress reduction program has been developed and popularized by Jon Kabat-Zinn
(1990, 1994, 2005), and a similar therapeutic technique, called Focusing, had previously been developed in
the late 1970s (Gendlin, 1990). Mindfulness has also been incorporated into psychotherapeutic approaches
to dealing with anxiety, depression, and feelings of unworthiness and insecurity (Brach, 2003; Brantley, 2003;
McQuaid & Carmona, 2004), and it has provided new perspectives on the treatment of addiction and anger
issues (Aronson, 2004; Dudley-Grant, 2003). Of particular interest to students, mindfulness has proven to
be helpful in alleviating the stress associated with studying psychology in graduate school (Borynski, 2003)!
In addition, Janet Surrey, one of the founding members of the Stone Center group, has studied comparisons
between mindfulness and relational therapy (Surrey, 2005). Likewise, Trudy Goodman, who studied with
Jean Piaget and now also teaches insight meditation, has utilized mindfulness in therapy with children
(Goodman, 2005).
This traditional approach to mindfulness is usually associated with Southeast Asia, particularly the Thai
forest monks. Jack Korneld, a former Buddhist monk and currently a clinical psychologist, practiced with
the renowned Ajahn Chah. Ajahn Chah's teachings have been translated into English (Ajahn Chah, 2001),
and another of his students has written two books in English (Ajahn Sumedho, 1987; 1995).

Thanissaro

Bhikku is another interesting individual dedicated to oering the teachings of the Buddha, known as the
Dhamma.

In conjunction with Dhamma Dana Publications, he has written his own book (Thanissaro

Bhikkhu, 1993), translated the works of Buddhist monks and nuns (Ajaan Fuang Jotiko, 2005; Upasika Kee
Nanayon, 1995), and translated with commentary some of the Pali Canon, the rst written record of the
teachings of the Buddha (Thanissaro Bhikkhu, 1996). Dhamma Dana Publications is committed to the free
dissemination of these teachings and their books, sending many copies to people in prison who wish to better
their lives. This is, of course, an active application of the Buddha's teachings, and a way to help improve
our society.

Discussion Question: The Buddha proposed a method for alleviating the suering associated with our
desires and distresses: the four mindfulness trainings. Have you ever tried meditating, particularly the form
of mindfulness meditation taught in the Theravadan tradition? Has it been helpful, or if you haven't tried
it, do you think it might be helpful?

The Neurobiology of Mindfulness
We began this chapter by looking at genetics and biology. We then transitioned into Buddhist mindfulness techniques that are thousands of years old. Today, these two disciplines have come together in some
fascinating research. Neurobiologists and psychologists are working together with advanced meditators and
respected Buddhist monks (including His Holiness the Dalai Lama) to study the activity of the brain, in
real time, during meditation. These studies may also help to advance our understanding of the nature of the
mind, but that may still be somewhat beyond our technical abilities. The interest of the eld of psychology,
and academia in general, is clearly evidenced by articles that have been written about these studies in venues

Science (Barinaga, 2003), the popular The Chronicle of Higher Education
Monitor on Psychology published by the American Psychological Association

such as the prestigious journal
(Monastersky, 2006), and the
(Winerman, 2006).

Cognitive neuroscience has taken advantage of many technical advances in brain imaging, such as
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), single photon emission computed tomography
(SPECT), and positron emission tomography (PET) to study the activity of the brain during mental tasks. Initially, these studies focused on identifying brain regions involved in very specic tasks. More
recently, however, some investigators have become interested in using these techniques to study broad questions, such as the nature of the mind. Since we don't know what the nature of the mind is, we don't exactly
know what to look for in these brain imaging studies.

So, the investigators pursuing this research must

creatively examine the brain during meditation (as well as under other conditions). It has been shown that
meditation activates neural structures involved in attention and arousal (Lazar et al., 2000, 2005a; Newberg,
2001), alterations in sensory processing and the sense of space (Lazar, 2005a; Newberg, 2001), and a dramatic increase in synchronization of neural activity (Lutz et al., 2004). In perhaps the most striking of these
studies, Lazar and her colleagues have demonstrated that long-term meditation practice is associated with
increased cortical thickness in brain regions associated with attention and sensory processing (Lazar, 2005a).
These eects were most pronounced in the older subjects, suggesting that meditation may have benecial
eects in terms of osetting age-related declines in cortical thickness. Given these dramatic changes in brain
function as a result of meditation, perhaps it should come as no surprise that meditation and mindfulness
have proven to be useful adjuncts to therapy for a wide variety of psychological and medical disorders (for
reviews see Lazar, 2005b and Newberg & Lee, 2005; see also Cozolino, 2002; Germer et al., 2005; Siegel,
2007).

PET scan images of the author's brain on the anti-Parkinson's Disease drug l-DOPA (for research).
The use of these brain imaging techniques to study the mind during meditation raises the possibility that
they may be useful in studying other altered states of consciousness. Indeed, Amir Raz and his colleagues
(2005) have utilized fMRI and electrical scalp recording of event-related potentials to demonstrate that
hypnotic suggestion reduces the activity of cortical regions in the brain that have been associated with
conict monitoring. In other words, when hypnosis is used to alter the behavior and cognition of individuals,
there are recognizable changes in brain function. When the study of hypnosis is combined with the data
obtained on alterations in brain function during meditation and under the inuence of mind-altering drugs
(see Mathew, 2001), it seems clear that the mind, either in its normal state or in various altered states, is
reected in unique states of neural activity.

We may be a long way from fully understanding the details

of the relationship between the mind and neural activity, and there may indeed be more to the mind than
simply the neural activity itself, but this is certainly a fascinating eld of study on the nature of who we are
as individuals.

Discussion Question: Cognitive neuroscientists have begun to identify changes in brain activity associated with meditation, and similar changes occur during hypnosis. What do you think this says about the
mind?

The dierent forms are typically

Japan today, its martial arts history has been inuenced more by Chinese settlers than by the Japanese
(Chesterman, 2003; Hornsey, 2002; Johnson, 2003a; Lewis, 1993; Ribner & Chin, 1978). Today, however,
the martial arts are popular worldwide. There are many forms in addition to those listed above, including

Capoeira, a martial art developed in Brazil by African slaves (Atwood, 1999). Capoeira is a particularly
complex martial art, involving play, dance, and music.

As some slaves escaped, they banded together to

ght Portuguese soldiers and help other slaves to escape. More recently, Capoeira was one of the inspirations
for break dancing, an African American dance style that developed in the 1970s and 1980s (Atwood, 1999).
Although the Western world certainly has its equivalent forms of armed and unarmed combat, such as
wrestling, boxing, and fencing (e.g., see Styers, 1974), they are not typically thought of as belonging to the
Asian forms of ghting known as the martial arts.
It is estimated that as many as 18 million people in America alone practice some form of the martial
arts (Nathan, 2005), and martial arts lms have proven very popular.
and more recently Chow Yun Fat (star of

From Bruce Lee to Jackie Chan,

Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,

which won four Academy

Awards [Lee, Ling, Schamus, & Jung, 2000]), we have seen examples of the classic good-guy, an honorable
individual defending those who are abused by others. The famous American martial artist and movie star
Chuck Norris, in cooperation with former President George H. W. Bush, has established a national program
called KICKSTART to introduce martial arts to at risk middle school students to raise their self-esteem
(Nathan, 2005).

Although the martial arts are often seen as an opportunity for athletic young men to

engage in disciplined and/or ritualized combat, there are also programs for children of all ages, general
physical conditioning, and people with disabilities (Chaline, 2003; Johnson, 2003b; McNab, 2003). There is
also a rich history of women practicing the martial arts (Atkinson, 1983; Chaline, 2003b). Indeed, Bruce
Lee rst studied the Wing Chun style of Kung Fu, a style developed some 400 years ago by a Buddhist nun
named Ng Mui and her student Yim Wing Chun, who was also a nun. It was later that Lee developed his
own technique, known as Jeet Kune Do or the way of the intercepting st (Lee, 1975; see also Johnson,
2003a; Lewis, 1993; Little, 1998; Ribner & Chin, 1978).
What sets the martial arts apart is the balanced approach to both physical exercise and spiritual/mental
discipline. Although the martial arts certainly existed farther back in ancient times, it is accepted by many
that they were rst formalized in the

Shao-Lin temple by the founder of Zen Buddhism, Bodhidharma.

When Bodhidharma rst arrived at the Shao-Lin temple in China, after leaving his home in India, he found
the monks in very poor physical condition. He developed a series of eighteen exercises that helped the monks
to achieve a good level of physical tness, something necessary for their self-defense as well as for extended

periods of sitting in meditation (Johnson, 2003a; Lewis, 1993; Red Pine, 1987; Ribner & Chin, 1978). These
exercises established the rst formal practice of Kung Fu. It is important to note the role of Bodhidharma,
a highly spiritual monk who had left his home to help spread the teachings of the Buddha. Since one of the
basic tenets of Buddhism is to not harm any other living being, the martial arts have always emphasized
mental discipline and the intention that the ghting skills should only be used in self-defense or in the defense
of others who cannot defend themselves. Non-combative forms of the martial arts have developed around
the concept of mindfulness of the body, which can be used as forms of moving meditation. Examples of such
forms are Tai Chi Chuan and Qigong (Johnson, 2003a,c; Lewis, 1993; Khor, 1981; Ribner & Chin, 1978).
There are also more traditional forms of martial arts, such as

Aikido and Hapkido (Hapkido being the

way of harmony; Chesterman, 2003), which emphasize the soft style of defending oneself that is advocated
in the

Tao Te Ching

(Lao Tsu, c600 B.C./1989). As with the regular martial arts, these soft, meditative,

defensive martial arts originated in the countries with the strongest histories in the more aggressive forms:
Tai Chi Chuan and Qigong originated in China, Aikido in Japan, and Hapkido in Korea.

When the martial arts are approached properly, as a means to health, strength, and a calm state of mind,
we can refer to the practice as the

martial Way, a means to living one's life in a virtuous manner (Chu,

2003). Because martial arts training can prepare one to injure others it must be approached with the right

attitude:
This concept of power as the cornerstone of personal freedom lies at the bottom of all martial arts
philosophy.

The recognition that power emanates from physical force and martial capability cuts both

ways; it can be channeled toward constructive uses or abused as a means of destruction. This is the reason
why martial arts training must always be directed toward the cultivation of the higher ideals of discipline,
humility, benevolence and responsibility. (pg. 29; Chu, 2003)
Continuing to emphasize the role that the martial arts can play in helping people to live a more satisfying
life, Chu goes on to say:
The demands of work, family, nances, as well as fatigue, neglect and health all distract the martial artist
from his best intentions. Even the devoted student may be disappointed if he expects martial arts training
to neatly bring his physical and spiritual condition into working order. Nevertheless, regular training can
serve as a constant, to discipline him to develop his best self even as the daily routine pulls him in dierent
directions. The strategies underlying training can be eectively applied not just in life threatening situations
but to daily life. (pgs. 44-45; Chu, 2003)
In order to help martial artists pursue and maintain this virtuous Way, various codes and tenets have

ve tenets of Taekwondo: courtesy, integrity, perseverance, self-control, and indomitable spirit. These principles were set
been devised. My family practices Taekwondo, so we have been taught to follow the

forth by General Choi Hong Hi, who re-established the modern forms of Taekwondo when Korea regained
its independence after World War II. He believed that if Taekwondo students lived their lives according to
these principles they would become better people and help to make the world a better place (Chesterman,

Bushido code of the Japanese
Samurai. It can sometimes be dicult to translate Asian languages into English, but generally the Bushido
2003; Lewis, 1993). Perhaps the most famous of the martial arts codes is the

code contains seven essential principles: making right decisions, bravery, compassion, taking right actions,
honesty, honor, and loyalty. Although these principles seem to include states of mind, or conscious intentions,
it is through the physical practice, through the body and the unconscious mind, that Bushido becomes a way
of life (Deshimaru, 1982). Only after many years of practice does this become a natural way of life, without
the need for continued attention to one's practice. Then many more years of practice are necessary before
one nally becomes a true master. The consciousness, or mindfulness, necessary for this combined practice
of body and mind can be found in Zen Buddhism, which is closely intertwined with

Budo, the Japanese

way of the warrior (Deshimaru, 1982). As with the tenets of Taekwondo, the principles of the Bushido code
helped warriors to restrain themselves from violent aggression in their daily lives (Chu, 2003). According
to Chu (2003), it is the higher ideals of spirituality in codes like Bushido and the tenets of Taekwondo that
separates the warrior from the predator.
Despite having emphasized the balance between physical and spiritual aspects of the martial arts, we
must still consider that they can play a most important role in self-defense. It is an unfortunate reality that
there are many people in this world who don't follow virtuous principles such as the tenets of Taekwondo
or the Bushido code. I am fortunate to know a martial artist and special education teacher named David
Schied, who wrote a most interesting book combining martial arts, Eastern philosophy, and basic techniques
of self-defense in all aspects of one's life (Schied, 1986). Many people live timid lives, some live in outright
fear. It has been suggested that as many as 160,000 children miss school every day out of fear that they will
be bullied by other students (Nathan, 2005). This fear can seriously disrupt our ability to function in our
daily world:
Most of us don't see ourselves as unied human beings (people who can call forth all our resources and
use our total capabilities at will). We tend not to give our all to the situation at hand (even when nothing
less will do). Instead of giving our best we give enough which rarely is enough. Left to our own means most
of us respond to life's demands in a fragmented fashion. Instead of reacting to the challenges of everyday
life by focusing and directing our energies to the task at hand, we respond haphazardly and incompletely.
(pg. iv; Schied, 1986)
By studying the martial arts and other techniques of self-defense and security, and by learning strategies
to become aware of and deal with our emotional responses to danger, we can not only resolve our fears in
those dangerous situations, but we can also remain calm and in control of other aspects or our lives (Schied,

277

1986). In addition to simply preparing for danger by learning how to avoid it or how to ght when one can't
avoid it, the age-old Eastern techniques of meditation and mindfulness can help to calm one's nerves before,
during, and after facing a crisis. As peace of mind becomes your usual emotional state, you become more
open to living your own life and enjoying your relationships with others in a loving and compassionate way.
Then, when faced with danger from another:
The opening of yourself to life with love will enable you not only to take proper measures for the extension
of your life (surviving) in an attack, but also to greet your attacker as everyone else you meet - with an open
hand and an open mind. You will begin to see an innite number of ways to share love with those who mean
you bodily harm. By giving to another that love which is so plentiful within you, you will help instead of
hurt him.

This is the ultimate self-defense.

(pg. 208; Schied, 1986)

Discussion Question: The martial Way refers to integrating the physical, spiritual, and mental aspects
of the martial arts into your daily life. Have you ever practiced a martial art? If yes, how seriously did you
take the spiritual philosophy of your particular martial art or the martial arts in general?

Final Note
This chapter may seem to have an odd assortment of topics, but if we look closely we can better understand
the meaningful connections. We have covered: 2,500 year-old Buddhist teachings on mindfulness, 1,500 yearold techniques in the martial arts, 100-year-old Victorian era theories on somatic psychology, recent theories
in sociobiology and evolutionary psychology, and cutting-edge brain imaging of real-time changes in mental
states! How can all of this possibly t together? The answer is actually quite simple. For as long as people
have been able to wonder, they have wondered about the two things in our lives that cannot be denied: the
fact that we have a body, and the fact that we are aware of it. Conscious awareness of our own existence,
and the body that is the physical manifestation of that existence, is something that all people, all races and
all nationalities, have shared throughout time. These topics are the most thoroughly cross-cultural topics in
psychology.
Finally, when Bruce Lee's famous movie

Enter the Dragon

was rst released in the United States, they

cut one of the opening scenes in which he is tested by his master on his understanding of fundamental
Buddhist/Daoist philosophy as it pertains to the martial arts. In the twenty-fth anniversary special edition,
Warner Brothers studios apparently decided that American audiences would now appreciate this dialogue,
so they put the scene back into the movie (Clouse & Allin, 1998).

Personality Theory in Real Life: An Evolutionary Perspective on the
Development of Pathological Personality Patterns
In the Appendix, there is a brief presentation of Theodore Millon's alternative classication scheme
for personality disorders, as compared to the DSM-IV (Millon, 1996; Millon & Grossman, 2005).

This

perspective is based on Millon's belief that personality disorders represent patterns of thought and behavior
that are adaptive, albeit under abnormal conditions, and therefore have been selected for through the process
of evolution. Millon believes that it is necessary for psychology to draw upon related elds of science in order
to strengthen the entire discipline:
Much of psychology as a whole remains adrift, divorced from broader spheres of scientic knowledge,
isolated from deeper and more fundamental, if not universal, principles. . .we have failed to draw on the rich
possibilities that may be found in both historic and adjacent realms of scholarly pursuit. (pg. 333; Millon
& Grossman, 2005)
Millon and Grossman acknowledge the contributions of sociobiology to our understanding of human behavior, and they oer a sociobiological perspective on personality. Personality, they argue, can be thought of
as the distinctive style of adaptive functioning that an individual exhibits as they relate to their typical range
of environments. Personality development is healthy when the individual encounters average or relatively
normal environments and is eective in adapting to them. Personality disorders arise when the individual
relies on maladaptive functioning that can be traced to psychic deciencies, trait imbalances, or internal
conicts that occur when relating to their environment. In other words, when individuals adapt to abnormal
environments (e.g., an abusive home), their personality style may then prove to be maladaptive in situations
outside of their typical environment.
Millon proposes that every person, indeed every organism, must accomplish four basic goals, each of

CHAPTER 11. BIOLOGY AND PERSONALITY

278

which has two polarities: they must exist (seek pleasure and avoid pain), they must adapt (respond actively
or remain passive), they must reproduce (focus on self or focus on others), and they must deal with unexpected or abstract situations (rely on thinking or react to feelings). These four demands correspond to four
neurodevelopmental stages: sensory attachment associated with life enhancement (seeking pleasure) or life
preservation (avoiding pain), sensorimotor autonomy associated with modifying the environment (active) or
accommodating to the environment (passive), pubertal genital identity associated with propagating oneself
(self-oriented) or nurturing children (other-oriented), and nally intracortical integration associated with
intellect (thinking-oriented) or emotion (feeling-oriented).

It should be clear that these stages cover the

range of development from birth to young adulthood. In contrast to theories that focus on critical points in
development as key times when psychological problems occur:

. . .the quality

or

kind of stimulation the youngster experiences is often of greater importance.

The impact

of parental harshness or inconsistency, of sibling rivalry or social failure, is more than a matter of stimulus
volume and timing.

Dierent dimensions of experience take precedence as the meaning conveyed by the

source of stimulation becomes clear to the growing child. (pg. 361; Millon & Grossman, 2005)
While it is dicult to clearly dene what constitutes normal vs. abnormal personalities, in simple terms
individuals who are relatively normal are able to shift between and balance the demands of each of these
polarities as appropriate to the situations they encounter. When examining individuals with pathological
personality patterns (a term preferred by Millon & Grossman, since personality

disorder

implies a medical

condition that might be cured), their behavioral constraints arise primarily from within themselves, due to
the abnormal conditions in which they developed.

The traits associated with these abnormal personality

patterns take on an inner momentum and autonomy, so they are expressed regardless of the external situation.
In other words, individuals with pathological personality patterns are not able to appropriately adapt their
behaviors to dierent situations in which they nd themselves.
The following is a description of one abnormal personality type, the self-defeating (masochistic) personality:
This disorder stems largely from a reversal of the pain-pleasure polarity. These persons interpret events
and engage in relationships in a manner that is not only at variance with this deeply rooted polarity but
is contrary to the associations these life-promoting emotions usually acquire through learning. To the selfdefeating personality, pain may be a preferred experience, tolerantly accepted if not encouraged in intimate
relationships. It is often intensied by purposeful self-denial, and blame acceptance may be aggravated by
acts that engender diculties as well as by thoughts that exaggerate past misfortunes and anticipate future
ones. (pp. 376-377; Millon & Grossman, 2005)
As strange as this condition seems, how might it arise? How does a person develop an adaptive strategy
that seeks pain, and how can such a strategy actually be adaptive? Imagine an abused child, whose only
source of love is the parents who abuse them! In such a terrible situation, the best strategy for the child
to adapt might be to reverse the pleasure-pain polarity. This is clearly an extreme response, but one that
might make the child's world easier to endure and less likely to create further abuse. However, when the
child grows up and moves on to other relationships, the deeply embedded characteristics of this pathological
personality pattern make healthy relationships all but impossible.

An important point to make here is

that the term adaptive is not always synonymous with our ideas of good psychological health. Adaptation
can only be considered within its particular context.

And that is exactly the consideration that Millon

proposes in his evolutionary perspective on personality development. Each person develops adaptively to
their own environment, and as a result they establish persistent characteristics (personality patterns) along
the polarities of pain-pleasure, active-passive, self-other, and thinking-feeling. Whether these adaptations
are healthy or unhealthy is a matter to be determined after the fact.

However, by recognizing how they

develop, as psychologists we can attempt to educate others on how to avoid causing these conditions.

11.3 Review of Key Points
•

Twin studies, adoption studies, and family studies allow us to examine the heritability of personality
traits. Identical twins share 100 percent of the genetic material, and siblings raised in dierent families

following adoption allow for an ideal comparison between genetic and environmental factors.

•

As important as genetics are, the environment also plays a signicant role in development. Studies on
intelligence have shown a strong degree of heritability, but culture also makes a signicant contribution.

•

Behavior genetics is the term used for the study of the inuence of genetics on behavior. Kagan has
demonstrated that temperament, the emotional component of personality, appears to be the most
salient of inborn characteristics. According to Kagan, approximately 10 percent of children are naturally inhibited, whereas approximately 20 percent of children are naturally more outgoing and adventurous.

•

Studies on the heritability of personality traits consistently show that genetics is responsible for approximately 50 percent of the nature of our personality.

Genetic factors also play a role in a wide

variety of other psychological factors, such as attitudes, interests, and psychological disorders.

•

Current studies on the role of genetics in personality tend to focus on gene-environment interactions.
Kagan's research has identied the amygdala, and its role in emotional reactivity to novel situations,
as an important neurological structure in the development of a behavioral inhibition system in some
people.

•

Sociobiology examines the role of evolution in the behavior of humans. Sociobiologists focus on inclusive
tness, the advantage that a given behavior confers on the likelihood of specic genes being passed on
to an individual's ospring or the ospring of their close kin.

•

Sociobiology allows for new perspectives on behavior that might otherwise seem illogical or, at least,
dicult to explain.

Patterns of mate selection, parenting and grandparenting, and religion all oer

biological advantages when viewed from this perspective.

•
•

Evolutionary psychology is the eld of study in which sociobiology is specically applied to psychology.
Richard Dawkins has suggested that cultural units, which he calls memes, are subject to the same
rules of evolution as are genes. The transmission of these cultural units may play a critical role in the
development of individuals and the human species as a whole.

•
•

Evolutionary psychology is the specic application of sociobiology to the eld of psychology.
Reich's somatic psychology is focused on the intimate interrelationship between the body and the mind.
He believed that psychological health required the fulllment and release of biological energy through
the orgasm.

Reich also described the physical presentation of individuals demonstrating muscular

armoring, which he considered to be the natural consequence of inhibiting aggression.

•

The Buddha described consciousness as arising from moments of contact, the contact between a sense
object (stimulus), a sense organ, and awareness of the object.

•

Being mindful of these moments of contact involves practicing the four mindfulness trainings: mindfulness of body, mindfulness of feeling, mindfulness of mind, and mindfulness of mental objects.

•

Mindfulness training has had a signicant impact on Western psychology. Examples include the inuential mindfulness-based stress reduction program developed by Jon Kabat-Zinn and Focusing. Mindfulness training has also been extended to working with children and to relational-cultural therapy.

•

Cognitive neuroscientists are beginning to demonstrate changes in brain function as a result of deep
meditation. Similar changes occur during hypnosis, suggesting the possibility of some inherent function
for altered states of consciousness.

•

The martial arts provide methods for training the body and mind together. The rst formal martial
arts program appears to have been developed by the founder of Zen Buddhism, Bodhidharma.

He

intended to help the monks at the Shao-Lin temple keep their bodies t as they devoted their lives
to meditation. These concepts of keeping body and mind t together leads to a lifestyle that can be
called the martial Way.

•

The martial arts include guidelines for balancing physical discipline with spiritual/mental discipline.
Examples of these guidelines include the ve tenets of Taekwondo and the Bushido code of the Samurai
warriors.

Erik Erikson

Erik Erikson is one of the few personality theorists from a Western perspective who addressed the entire
lifespan.

He shifted from Freud's emphasis on psychosexual conicts to one of psychosocial crises, which

have unique manifestations through adulthood and old age. Erikson's theory has always been popular, but
as our society has become increasingly older the need has grown to understand the aged individual, making
Erikson's perspective even more valuable and relevant today than it was when he rst proposed it. If, indeed,
Erikson's perspective on the personality changes occurring in adulthood and old age do become more relevant
with time, it may result in an interesting change in Erikson's place in psychology. Although most personality
textbooks devote a chapter to Erikson, and he is typically covered in lifespan developmental texts as well, he
is not mentioned in most history of psychology textbooks, and those that do mention him do so only briey.
As popular as he is with students of psychology, and most psychology faculty as well, becoming a common
topic in the history of his eld would be a distinct honor.
It is also important to note that Erikson was rst, and foremost, a psychoanalyst, and a child psychoanalyst at that. He did not neglect the importance of childhood as he pursued the psychosocial changes that
accompany aging:
One may scan work after work on history, society, and morality and nd little reference to the fact that
all people start as children and that all peoples begin in their nurseries. It is human to have a long childhood;
it is civilized to have an ever longer childhood. Long childhood makes a technical and mental virtuoso out
of man, but it also leaves a lifelong residue of emotional immaturity in him. (pg. 12; Erikson, 1950)

Brief Biography of Erik Erikson
The most curious aspect of Erik Erikson's life is certainly that his name was not Erikson. No one alive
today knows the name of his real father, and he never learned it either. He implored his mother to tell him
who his father was, as did his wife Joan, but Erikson's mother had promised her second husband, Theodor
Homburger, the man who raised Erikson and whose name Erikson had been given, that she would never
reveal the truth. And she kept that promise. When Erikson and his family moved to the United States,
their son Kai was taunted by schoolmates, who called him hamburger, hamburger.

So, Erikson and his

wife turned to the Scandinavian tradition of naming a son after his father, and they called their son Kai
Erik's son, or Kai Erikson. They then adopted the surname themselves, becoming Erik and Joan Erikson.
It is also surprising to note that Joan Erikson's name was not Joan. Her rst name was Sarah, and as a
child she was called Sally. According to her daughter Sue, she hated both names, and eventually chose to be
called Joan (Sue Erikson Bloland, 2005).
Erik Homburger Erikson was born Erik Salomonsen on June 15, 1902, near Frankfurt, Germany.

His

mother, Karla Abrahamsen, was from a wealthy Jewish family in Copenhagen, Denmark. She had married a
man named Valdemar Salomonsen, but her husband left Europe within a day of their marriage and went to
North America; she never saw him again and he seems to have had no further relationship with her. A few
years later she became pregnant, and in order to avoid scandal, she either left or was sent away from Denmark

to Germany, where she would be near relatives. She settled near Frankfurt, and raised Erikson alone. Shortly
after Erikson was born, they received word that Valdemar Salomonsen had died, making Erikson's mother
a widow. When, at about the age of 3, Erikson became ill, his mother took him to the local pediatrician,
Theodor Homburger. Karla Abrahamsen and Theodor Homburger fell in love, got married, and Homburger
helped to raise Erikson as his own son. Erikson was 8 years old when he learned the truth that Homburger
was not his father, but he still grew up as Erik Homburger, since his mother never revealed the truth about
his actual father's name (Bloland, 2005; Coles, 1970; Friedman, 1999).
As a child, Erikson was never secure in his relationship with his mother. They were close, and his mother
delighted in his intelligence and sensitivity. She shared her passion for philosophy and art with her son, but
she had to pay special attention to her new and very proper husband Dr. Homburger. Erikson himself was,
by all accounts, deeply traumatized by his mother shifting her attention to this new husband, and by the
deception he eventually learned about regarding the fact that Homburger was not his father. Although he
was eventually adopted by Homburger, it was more about proper appearances than any close relationship
between step-father and step-son. Later in life, Erikson rarely ever mentioned him (Bloland, 2005; Coles,
1970; Friedman, 1999).
Erikson attended a primary school for 4 years, and then went to a very traditional
studied Latin and Greek, German literature, ancient history, and art.

Gymnasium.

He

He was not a particularly good

student, but he excelled at history and art. Since the Homburger family was rather prestigious, and given
his mother's interest in art, their home was often entertained by many regional artists. Erikson sought formal
training as an artist, and was considered quite talented. So, rather than attending college, he spent a year
wandering through Europe living a Bohemian lifestyle. However, he was still deeply troubled by his sense
of having no identity, no heritage, and by his own account was marginally functional at best. He was able
to make ends meet only because his mother secretly sent him money, something his step-father would have
been very angry about, because Homburger was becoming openly intolerant of Erikson's avoidance of social
and nancial responsibility. After a year, Erikson returned home and entered an art school, and then went to
Munich to study at another art school. After 2 years in Munich he moved to Florence, Italy, where he spent
most of his time wandering around and studying people. He also made friends with other wandering artists,
including a writer named Peter Blos, who had actually been in his graduating class at the

Gymnasium

and

who later became a well-known child psychoanalyst. Eventually, however, Erikson realized he would not be
successful as an artist, and he returned home, caught in the grip of a deep depression (Bloland, 2005; Coles,
1970; Friedman, 1999).
Then, in 1927, something most important happened in Erikson's life.

His friend Peter Blos had been

privately tutoring the children of Dorothy Burlingham, a wealthy American who had come to Vienna for
psychoanalysis and to meet Sigmund Freud. Blos had been living with the Burlinghams, and he also came
to know the Freud family well, but he had decided that the time had come to move on.

However, Mrs.

Burlingham and her close, personal friend Anna Freud did not want to lose a teacher they were so fond of.
So, they oered Blos the opportunity to establish a school of his own, and he invited Erikson to help him
develop the curriculum and to teach art and history. Blos and Erikson were given a free hand to develop a
progressive curriculum, and the two men ourished. The results were astounding. The children had great
freedom, and with Erikson they studied art, music, poetry, German history, ancient history, geography, they
read about Eskimos and American Indians, and they made tools, toys, and exhibits. The environment in
what came to be known as the Hietzing School also provided much food for thought for Anna Freud, as she
was just developing her ideas on the psychoanalysis of children (Bloland, 2005; Coles, 1970; Friedman, 1999).
Through his relationship with the Burlingham family and Anna Freud, Erikson became well acquainted
with the entire Freud family. He greatly impressed Anna Freud with how quickly he bonded with the children
in the Hietzing School. So, he was accepted into psychoanalysis, both as a patient and a psychoanalyst in
training. Since his interests in the school had shifted from teaching to studying and observing the children
as they lived their lives, Erikson, like Anna Freud, was already interested in becoming a child psychoanalyst.
As he pursued his psychoanalytic training, he also pursued training in the Montessori approach to education.
He actually became one of only two men in the Vienna Montessori Women's Teacher Association. As if all
this wasn't enough, in 1929 Erikson met Joan Serson. Born in a small town in Ontario, Canada, she had

283

moved to Vienna to pursue her own studies (she had a Master's degree in Sociology, and had been working
on a Ph.D.). The two met at a masked ball at a palace in Vienna, and before long were living together, and
Serson was teaching at the Hietzing School with Erikson and Blos. In the spring of 1930, Serson went to
Philadelphia, where her mother was very ill. While there she learned that she was pregnant. She returned
to Vienna, only to nd that Erikson balked at marrying her. However, a number of his friends urged him
to avoid the mistakes of his own father, and that he should not abandon the woman who was carrying his
child, let alone the child itself. So, Joan and Erik Erikson were married in 1930. She joined the faculty of
the Hietzing School, and there were clearly some happy times:
After our marriage we lived on the Kueniglberg, above the school. When our son Kai was born (after
some time out for Joan) we daily carried him between us in a laundry basket to the tiny schoolyard or the
Rosenfelds' back porch. It became routine that the children would tell us during class when he was crying
(Kai weint), and in the intermission some watched him being nursed. It was enriching for us all to share
this experience. (pg. 5; Erikson & Erikson, 1980).
In 1932, however, the Hietzing School closed, in part because some of the children returned to America
with their families, and in part because of dierent opinions on how the school should be run between Mrs.
Burlingham and Anna Freud on one hand and Erikson and Blos on the other. Not only did it seem appropriate
that Erikson move on from the school in Vienna, the climate in Europe was becoming increasingly hostile as
the Nazis took over Germany and the surrounding areas (including Austria). Erikson was concerned about
his family (they had two sons by that point). So Erikson moved his young family to America, in order to
escape the dangerous conditions brewing in Europe (Bloland, 2005; Coles, 1970; Friedman, 1999).
Considering his illustrious credentials, having been an acquaintance of Sigmund Freud and trained by
Anna Freud, Erikson was welcomed into the American psychoanalytic community, despite never having
graduated from college (let alone medical school). The Eriksons never really settled anywhere, in many ways
his career was one of unending research and clinical experience.

In 1933, the Eriksons moved to Boston,

Massachusetts, and Erik received appointments at the Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts General Hospital, and the Judge Baker Guidance Center.

He was associated with the Harvard Psychological Clinic,

and came to know Henry Murray. In 1936, he accepted a position at Yale University's Institute of Human
Relations, where he met John Dollard. Dollard encouraged Erikson's interests in cross-cultural research and
in extending Freud's theories to the entire lifespan. Indeed, Dollard may have had a signicant inuence on
Erikson's eight-stage theory of development (Coles, 1970; Friedman, 1999).
In the summer of 1938, the year that his daughter was born, Erikson joined anthropologist Scudder
Mekeel on a trip to the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota to study the children of the Sioux Indians.
He was able to make extensive observations of mother-child interactions, and to talk with employees of the
Bureau of Indian Aairs. In 1939 the Eriksons moved to California. Erikson practiced psychoanalysis in San
Francisco, taught at the University of California, and continued his studies on Native Americans by visiting
the Yurok tribe in Northern California. During this time he consolidated his major interests into his most
signicant book,

Childhood and Society

(Erikson, 1950), which includes sections on the inuence of social

life, culture (based on his Native American studies), the use of toys and playing when studying children, the
evolution of identity, and the eight stages of development. Erikson also became an American citizen (Coles,
1970; Friedman, 1999).
In 1944, however, a disturbing and tragic event befell the Eriksons, one that they kept secret as much as
possible. They had a fourth child, named Neil. When she went to deliver the child, Joan Erikson had been
heavily sedated, because of a surgical procedure that had been planned ahead of time (as a result of an earlier
pregnancy). Erikson was summoned by the doctors, who told him that his newborn child was a Mongolian
Idiot (known today as a Down Syndrome child). The case was considered severe, and he was told it was
unlikely that the child would live more than a year or two.

The medical sta recommended having the

child institutionalized. Erikson was not used to making such decisions, it was Joan who ran the household
and supported him while he worked. He called a close friend, Margaret Mead. She assured him that the
medical sta was right. Another friend, Joseph Wheelwright (a respected Jungian analyst) agreed. Erikson
signed the necessary papers, and Neil Erikson was transferred before his mother ever woke up. The decision
tormented both of them. Joan felt that she had never been given a chance to participate in the decision, but

she also never made any eort to bring Neil home. They told their children that he had died, and many of
their friends never knew he had even existed (no mention is made in the 1970 biography by Robert Coles).
After a year or two they did tell their oldest son, Kai, but he was strictly forbidden to mention Neil. Making
the situation even more tragic was the fact that Neil lived to be 21 years old. Since much less was known
about mental retardation at the time, and this occurred well before the prevailing attitude had begun to
change, what else might the doctors have been wrong about (Bloland, 2005; Friedman, 1999)?
In 1949, Erikson was appointed as a professor at the University of California at Berkeley.

Within a

year, however, as McCarthyism gripped America, Erikson refused to sign a loyalty oath. Erikson protested
publicly, his statement was read at conferences and published in the journal

Psychiatry.

He was not a

communist, and had never had any interest in communism, but he felt that signing the oath would have
made him a hypocrite, as well as being a betrayal of junior colleagues who had refused to sign the oath and
were promptly dismissed. Although the tenure committee recommended that he be allowed to remain at the
University of California, due in large part to the dismissal of junior colleagues, Erikson resigned his position.
He was quickly oered a position at the Austen Riggs Center in Stockbridge, Massachusetts (Coles, 1970;
Friedman, 1999).
Erikson was something of a celebrity in Stockbridge. He spent 10 years in Stockbridge, during which he
published

Young Man Luther

(Erikson, 1958), an historical/psychoanalytic biography that brought together

two of Erikson's academic strengths, and that brought him a certain amount of acclaim. He also taught a
graduate seminar at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, using
course.

Young Man Luther

as a model for the

He was subsequently oered a professorship at Harvard, but not without some controversy.

One

of the faculty who protested Erikson's appointment, claiming that he came at too high a price (literally),
was David McClelland. Others supported Erikson, and he was eventually appointed as a professor with no
particular department. It proved to be a good decision. Erikson used his inuence and personal connections
to invite renowned guest speakers, ranging from pediatrician Benjamin Spock to anthropologist Margaret
Mead and Beat poet Allen Ginsberg. He inspired students such as Howard Gardner, Carol Gilligan, and
future congressman, senator, and Vice President of the United States Albert Gore, Jr.

(Gore wrote a

biography of his father for Erikson's class). Erikson also continued his interest in historical biography with
the publication of

Truth

Gandhi's Truth (Erikson, 1969), following a 3-month visit to India in 1962/1963. Gandhi's

won a Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award. Always afraid that he would not be recognized

for his accomplishments, Erikson hoped that he would also win the Nobel Prize for Literature, and he was
disappointed when it did not happen (Bloland, 2005; Coles, 1970; Friedman, 1999).
Erikson retired in 1970, and he and Joan returned to California. Erikson continued writing for a number
of years, focusing on issues related to personality changes that accompany old age.

Eventually, however,

time began to catch up with him. In 1987, as his health deteriorated, he and Joan returned to Cambridge,
Massachusetts to live with two young professors who could help Joan care for her husband. He died in 1994
(Bloland, 2005; Coles, 1970; Friedman, 1999).
Joan Erikson missed her husband terribly, but managed to spend some time on her own writing. She
wrote several chapters that were added as an addendum to

The Life Cycle Completed, in which she proposed

a ninth stage of development (Erikson & Erikson, 1997). She spoke to their daughter Sue regularly as Sue
followed her father's footsteps and became a psychoanalyst.

Sue Erikson Bloland was deeply concerned,

however, since Lawrence Friedman was about to publish his biography on Erikson, which included extensive
coverage of the Erikson's son Neil. Fortunately, perhaps, Joan Erikson died in 1997, and never had to face
the public reaction to Friedman's biography (Bloland, 2005).

Special Biographical Note: While preparing his biography on Erikson, Lawrence Friedman tried his
best to identify Erikson's father.

He went to Copenhagen to review historical documents and interview

relatives, particularly in the Abrahamsen family. There was a persistent rumor that Erik Erikson had been
named after his real father, who had been a court photographer.

According to historical records of the

appropriate time period, there were two court photographers in Copenhagen named Erik: Erik Strom and
Erik Bahnsen. However, little evidence supports that either of these men could have been Erikson's father.
Thus, Friedman concluded that this mystery will never be solved (Friedman, 1999).

on one side of his family). What do you know of your heritage? In what way, if any, has it inuenced your
personal development?

Placing Erikson in Context: Psychodynamic Challenges Across the Lifespan
Erik Erikson is well-known and popular, and he was highly respected by most of his colleagues. He knew
Sigmund Freud personally, and he was trained in psychoanalysis by Anna Freud.

And yet, it is dicult

to place Erikson in context. He believed that he had remained true to Freud's theories, but his shift from
psychosexual stages to psychosocial crises, and his extension of them throughout the lifespan, was something
that Anna Freud found objectionable, and she dismissed his work as not much. . . designed to make my
father's work palatable to Harvard freshman (cited in Bloland, 2005). Erikson was always bothered by this
rejection, even when the importance of his place in psychoanalytic theory was assured by others.
Erikson also stands apart from most other theorists with his emphasis on the continuation of psychodynamic processes throughout the lifespan. Although Jung had discussed the importance of middle age, his
theorizing was based on Eastern perspectives, not on psychodynamic theory. A number of other analysts
emphasized sociocultural factors in adulthood, including Adler and Horney, but only Erikson proposed a
continuous, single theory from birth to old age, a theory based on traditional psychodynamic perspectives.
Erikson was not unique in his emphasis on cross-cultural studies, but other theorists typically looked to
conrm their psychodynamic theory after the fact. Erikson's studies on the childhood of the Sioux and the
Yurok helped him form his psychosocial theory, since those studies were part of his experience during the
time his theory was forming in his mind.
And nally, Erikson was one of the few theorists who addressed personality changes in old age. As life
expectancy continues to rise in America, there are many more elderly people today than ever before. And
they are healthier at older ages as well. Thus, our understanding of the unique aspects of the elderly person
will become increasingly more relevant, not only to psychology, but to all of society as well.

Basic Concepts Underlying the Study of Development
Erikson is well known for his theory on the eight stages of development. He did not simply theorize these
stages, of course. He drew upon Sigmund Freud's basic theories, Anna Freud's explorations in the psychological development of children, and his own experience as a teacher and, later, as a child psychoanalyst. In
addition, he attempted to repeat many of his observations in dierent cultures, particularly in two Native
American tribes, the Sioux and the Yurok.

These basic principles and observations form the foundation

upon which Erikson built his stage theory of development.

The Epigenetic Principle and Psychosocial Crises
Epigenesis is a biological term referring to the development of an embryo, and ultimately an adult
organism, from an undierentiated egg. Similarly, Erikson viewed psychological development as a series of
predictable stages in each individual. We begin life without having faced or resolved any of these stages.
Only the experience of our life can result in moving us along. This aspect of Erikson's theory is identical to
Freud's. Where they dier, however, is on the matter of what are the critical factors that drive the process
of these stages. For Sigmund Freud, it was psychosexual development, and each stage is based on the region
of the body from which the child gains sexual satisfaction (rst the mouth, then the anus, then the genitals,
etc.). In contrast, Erikson proposed that the underlying framework for the developmental stages is a series
of

psychosocial crises. Erikson used the term psychosocial crises to refer to turning points, or crucial

moments, in a person's development, which contain within them the potential for abnormal development
and the failure to reach one's development.
In other words, we face predictable, yet critical, developmental tasks as we move through our lives. We
cannot experience one aspect of a crisis without also experiencing the opposite aspect. Our goal, or task, is
to achieve a greater degree of the favorable aspect of the crisis (such as being more trusting than distrusting;
see below), within the context of our social and cultural environments (Erikson, 1950, 1954, 1968a).

Observing Children at Play
Erikson borrowed Freud's famous line regarding dreams as the royal road to the unconscious mind,
saying instead that

play is the royal road to understanding the young child's ego and identity development

(Erikson, 1950). With very young children there is a unique challenge for both experimental psychologists
and therapists: the child's limited language development.

Not only does observing play allow for insight

CHAPTER 12. ERIK ERIKSON

286

into ego development, it can also show us the capacity for the ego to nd recreation and to cure itself, if
necessary. This makes play useful in the therapeutic setting, as we saw when examining the contributions
of Melanie Klein and Donald Winnicott.
Erikson studied childhood play extensively, publishing articles that included clinical notes on how and
why children build things or choose the toys they play with (Erikson, 1937), psychological factors behind and
eects of disruptions in play (Erikson, 1940), gender dierences in play (Erikson, 1955), and ethnic, racial,
nationality, and socioeconomic status dierences in play (Erikson, 1972). Ultimately, Erikson published

and Reasons

Toys

(Erikson, 1977), in which he argued that childhood play provides a basis for ritualizing our

life experiences, and that ritualization continues throughout the stages of life. Whether play serves to help
master and resolve traumatic experiences, or provides catharsis for pent-up emotion or surplus energy, or
whether it has a functional role in which a child can exercise new faculties and potentials in preparation for
the future, Erikson argued that play is an act of renewal and self-expression, one that can be an expression
of inventiveness and abandon. Play provides a means for connecting with others, in order to cope with the
challenges of life (Erikson, 1977).

Discussion Question: Have you ever watched children play? What has it told you about the individual
child, and is it always consistent with who you think that child is? What sort of games or sports do you like
to play, and do you like to play with children?

The Value of Cross-Cultural Studies
The value of studying other cultures was summarized rather succinctly by Erikson in an interview with
Richard Evans:
The interesting thing was that all the childhood problems which we had begun to take seriously on the
basis of pathological developments in our own culture, the Indians talked about spontaneously and most
seriously without any prodding. They referred to our stages as the decisive steps in the making of a good
Sioux Indian or a good Yurok Indian. . .And good meant whatever seemed virtuous in a strong man or
woman in that culture. I think this contributed eventually to my imagery of basic human strengths. (pg.
62; Erikson cited in Evans, 1964)
So, it was actually on the basis of cross-cultural comparisons that Erikson felt condent in proposing his
eight stage theory of psychosocial development.
Erikson was deeply indebted to two anthropologists, H. Scudder Mekeel and Alfred Kroeber, who introduced him to the Sioux and Yurok tribes they had been studying. Through their introductions, Erikson was
able to gain the condence of the individual Sioux and Yurok who provided Erikson with invaluable evidence
on their traditional ways of life and their child-rearing practices. But it is important to note that Native
Americans were not the only other cultural groups that Erikson studied. He studied the childhood myths of
Hitler and the Bolshevik myth of Maxim Gorky's youth, in an attempt to understand the terrible political
events that occurred in Nazi Germany and Communist Russia.

He also examined the factors inuencing

Black identity in America. He suggested that one of the greatest struggles for Blacks in this country, after
the Civil War had ended slavery, was the mostly false promise of a better life in the North. As they left
behind their successful identity as slaves (Note: successful only means that it was a clear identity, not that
it was moral or justied) for a fragmented identity of supposedly free people, though prejudice and discrimination were still rampant, even in the North. Erikson made some interesting comparisons between Blacks
and Native Americans in terms of their attempts to identify their place in American society:
I have mentioned the fact that mixed-blood Indians in areas where they hardly ever see Negroes refer
to their full-blood brothers as niggers, thus indicating the power of the national imagery which serves to
contrast the dominant ideal images and the dominant evil images in the inventory of available prototypes.
No individual can escape this opposition of images which, in a great variety of syndromes, is all-pervasive in
the men and in the women, in the majorities and in the minorities, and in all the classes of a given national
or cultural unit. (pg. 215; Erikson, 1950)
Individuals try to resolve their identity crises in as simple and straightforward a way as possible. Every
group within a society is somewhat familiar with the stereotypical identity attributed to other groups, and
these factors play an important role, even when they are expressed in negative ways, such as mixed-blood
Native Americans calling full-blooded Native Americans niggers.

Erikson later noted that full-blooded

287

Sioux on the Pine Ridge Reservation turn around and call their half-blooded brothers white trash (Erikson,
1980a). These factors also tell us something about the place dierent groups occupy in the minds of members
of other groups, and how that might inuence the individuals within those groups. We will return to the
concept of identity after examining Erikson's stages of development.

Discussion Question: Erikson believed that his theories had been conrmed in dierent cultures, such
as the Sioux and the Yurok. Do you think his theories apply to all cultures? If not, what problems do you
see with his work?

Erikson's Eight Stages of Development
Many people are familiar with Erikson's eight stages of life, but what is less well known is that each stage
is tied to specic, basic social institutions and is also associated with a particular strength, which Erikson
believed gave the individual a semblance of instinctive certainty in his social ecology (Erikson, 1968a; see
also Erikson, 1950).

Each stage can also be viewed as awakening a specic sense of estrangement, which

can become the basis for psychopathology. As we are about to see, the rst stage is basic trust vs. basic
mistrust. If a child develops basic trust, they will also develop the basic strength of hope. Then, as they
progress through life, they will likely encounter situations in which people cannot be trusted, but the person
can remain hopeful. In contrast, hopelessness is a term closely identied with depression, and it is easy to
see how a person who learns from the beginning of life that the people around them, indeed the whole world
(as they perceive it), is a threatening and untrustworthy place. As each of the eight stages is introduced,
the title will begin with the general age at which the stage occurs, the psychosocial crisis experienced during
that stage, and nally, the primary human strength that is associated with the successful resolution of the
crisis.

Infancy - Basic Trust vs. Basic Mistrust - Hope: The primary relationship (or social institution)
of this rst stage is the mother. The infant needs to be fed (and traditionally this was only breast-feeding),
comforted, and protected. As we have seen in earlier chapters, the child does not necessarily recognize that the
mother is a separate person, so the bond between them is extraordinarily intimate. It is inevitable, however,
that the child will experience discomfort and pain, and that the mother will not be able to immediately
attend to every need. In such times of distress, the child who mostly trusts in the care of their mother will
be able to hope that the care is coming.

primary social institution. As young children develop the ability to walk and talk they begin to do many
things for themselves. However, their actions often lead to restrictions, as they experience the categorical
rules of yes and no, right and wrong, or good and bad.

Shame is the consequence of being told that

one is bad or wrong. Doubt arises when the child is unsure. As they develop their will power, i.e., their
exercise of free will, they may not be sure what to do in a certain situation. A child who has been supported
in exercising their autonomy will develop the will power to restrain themselves without experiencing shame
or doubt. For example, they will learn not to run out into the busy street, and even feel good about their
ability to take care of and protect themselves. It is often fascinating to watch a young child demonstrate
this protectiveness when they interact with an even younger child.

One can easily see the satisfaction in

understanding rules and guidelines as, say, an eight-year old looks after a two-year old cousin.

Play Age - Initiative vs.

Guilt - Purpose: The entire family (e.g., siblings, grandparents, etc.)

provides the social context for this developmental stage. As the child of age three or four years old becomes
able to do much more, and to do so more vigorously, they begin to realize something of what is expected of
them as adults. So, they being to play with other children, older children, and to play games that mimic
things done by adults.

This helps them to develop a sense of purpose, and to pursue valued goals and

skills. Excessive initiative, especially when combined with autonomy, can lead to problems such as rivalry
and jealousy, especially with younger siblings.

It can also lead to aggressive manipulation or coercion.

Consequently, the child can begin to feel guilty about their actions, especially if they are punished.

Figure 12.2

As children grow a little older, they begin to mimic what they see being done by older children and
adults.
School Age - Industry vs. Inferiority - Competence: The social institutions relevant to this stage
now move outside the family, including the neighborhood, community, and schools. It is one thing to play
adult roles, such as in the previous stage, but in this stage the child actually begins the process of preparing
to be a caretaker and provider for others, such as their own children. In all cultures, according to Erikson,
at this age (beginning at 5 to 6 years old) children receive some form of systematic training, and they also
learn eagerly from older children. Unfortunately, some children are not as successful as others, particularly
in the restrictive learning environment of schools. Keep in mind that Erikson was trained in the Montessori
style of education, which emphasizes free exploration and active learning, at each child's own pace (Lillard &
Jessen, 2003; Spietz, 1991). If children are indeed successful, if they are given the freedom to learn, they will

develop a sense of competence, which will help them to persevere when faced with more challenging tasks.

Adolescence - Identity vs.

Role Diusion, Confusion - Fidelity: The family nally loses its

place of primacy as a social institution, as peer groups and outgroups become the most signicant social
institutions. According to Erikson, childhood comes to an end when a person has developed the skills and
tools to proceed into adulthood.
child to an adult:

First, however, there is the period in which one's body changes from a

puberty. Known psychologically as adolescence, it is a period in which each person must

determine how they will t their particular skills into the adult world of their culture. This requires forming
one's identity. The delity that Erikson speaks of refers to the ability to remain true to oneself, and to one's
signicant others. This period is easiest for children who are gifted and well trained in the pursuit of clear
goals, and also for children who receive a good deal of armation from their peers.
The pursuit of one's identity can be quite challenging, and we will examine identity in more detail in the
next section. But rst, one way to cope with the challenge of forming one's identity is to stop doing it for a
while, something Erikson called a psychosocial

moratorium (Erikson, 1959). A moratorium is a break that

one takes in life before committing oneself to a career. Some people serve in the military or the Peace Corps
before coming home and taking their place in the community. Some travel, and try to see the world, before
starting college. Erikson considered the moratorium to be a natural and, in many cases, quite productive
activity. To cite one of Erikson's examples, a young Charles Darwin, who had been training for the ministry,
left England on a 5-year voyage on a ship called the Beagle in order to participate in geological studies (he
was also studying geology).

It was during that trip that he made the initial observations of animals and

fossils that ultimately led to his theory of evolution.

Young Adulthood - Intimacy vs. Isolation - Love: With the onset of adulthood, the most signicant
social factors become partners in friendship, sex, competition, and cooperation.

Once an individual has

consolidated their own identity, they are capable of the self-abandonment necessary for intimate aliations,
passionate sexual unions, or inspiring encounters. According to Erikson, sexual encounters prior to fullling
this stage are of the identity-conrming kind, rather than the truly intimate sexual relationships based on
love.

Love is the mutual devotion of two people.

Individuals who are unsuccessful in making intimate

contacts are at risk for exaggerating their isolation, which brings with it the danger of not making any new
contacts that might lead to the very intimate relationship they are lacking.

Adulthood - Generativity vs.

Stagnation, Self-Absorption - Care: The family household,

including divided labor and shared household duties, becomes the primary social institution of adulthood.
Erikson also referred to adulthood as

maturity, and he considered this stage to be reciprocal. A mature

person needs to be needed, and it is their very maturity that guides them to care for the needs of others.
So, generativity is the concern with helping to establish and guide the next generation. It is psychosocial
because it includes productivity and creativity, not just procreation. When the potential enrichment to be
found in generativity fails, the consequences are often seen in the estrangements of the next generation.
In other words, the children of stagnant, self-absorbed parents may have great diculty forming their own
identities and achieving intimacy in their relationships.

Old Age - Integrity vs. Despair - Wisdom: The social concerns for those approaching the end of life
include Humanity and Family. Wisdom allows one to maintain and convey the integrity of one's lifetime
of experience, despite the gradual physical decline of the body. Wise people are able to pass on an integrated
heritage to the next generation. For those who have failed to integrate their life's experiences, despair arises
as the fear of death, death being the time limit on their opportunity to achieve integrity. Erikson described
wisdom as a detached and yet active concern with life in the face of death (Erikson, 1968a).
Is there a ninth stage? After Erikson died, Joan Erikson wrote a few short chapters that were added to

The Life Cycle Completed

(Erikson & Erikson, 1997). Erikson had suggested that his wife was an important

contributor to all of his theories, throughout his career, so it was not surprising that she oered these
additions after his death. Indeed, they are most likely the result of her observations regarding his death,
something he could then no longer write about.

Very Old Age - Despair vs. Gerotranscendence: Unlike the earlier stages, Joan Erikson felt that
the negative aspect of this stage should be placed rst. People who make it to 90 years old, and beyond, are
close to death. Their bodies are steadily deteriorating, most, if not all, of their friends have died, some of

CHAPTER 12. ERIK ERIKSON

290

their children may have died, their spouse has likely died, and the despair they face is quite real. The despair
experienced in the eighth stage involves looking back at one's life, but in the ninth stage it involves looking
squarely at one's present reality, and passing once again through life's stages. People who are very old can no
longer trust their own capabilities, and they may need to be cared for, thus losing some of their autonomy.
Their sense of purpose is dulled, and they lose the urgency and energy necessary to be industrious. Likewise,
their identity may become unclear once again, and they can become isolated and self-absorbed. However,
some very old people hold a special place in their families and/or communities, and may withdraw only by
choice, in order to contemplate and be at peace with their life. Joan Erikson refers to this choice as a dance
with life:
With great satisfaction I have found that transcendence become very much alive if it is activated into
transcendance, which speaks to soul and body and challenges it to rise above the dystonic, clinging aspects
of our worldly existence that burden and distract us from true growth and aspiration.
To reach for gerotranscendance is to rise above, exceed, outdo, go beyond, independent of the universe
and time. It involves surpassing all human knowledge and experience. How, for heaven's sake, is this to be
accomplished? I am persuaded that only by doing and making do we become. (pg. 127; Erikson & Erikson,
1997)

Discussion Question: Joan Erikson proposed a ninth stage, when death is imminent. Do you agree
with this stage; do you hope it is possible to achieve gerotranscendence? Have you known anyone who was
very old and facing death, and what was it like for them?

The Importance of Identity
The developmental crisis that Erikson focused much of his career on was that of developing one's identity.
From the beginning of publishing his theories, he emphasized that a lot of the psychological distress and
pathological symptoms seen in childhood can be interpreted as the child expressing their

right

to nd an

identity in the world, and neurosis typically results from the loss of one's identity (Erikson, 1950). Erikson

and confusion, is that only upon completion of the rst four stages of life is the ego fully mature, the point
at which a person is ready to be an adult. But the entire period, the entire psychosocial crisis, is a critical
time of transition:
Adolescents have always been especially open to conversion or to what is now called consciousnessexpansion in the direction of physical, spiritual, and social experience. Their cognitive capacities and social
interests are such that they want to go to the limit of experience before they t themselves into their culture
and t their culture to themselves. (pg. 37; Erikson cited in Evans, 1964)

A General Denition of Identity
Since Erikson labeled his fth stage of development identity vs.

role diusion and/or confusion, it is

common to think that identity formation is something that occurs during adolescence.

Actually, identity

formation begins at birth, and continues throughout the lifespan. It is only in adolescence that the individual
nally has the material around which to form an integrated identity that can remain somewhat stable, hence
the psychosocial crisis that arises during that process of integration and more stable identity formation.
Thus, a child will have some sense of self, but it is not until adolescence that it becomes a crisis. So what is
that sense of self that forms the identity? Erikson himself turned to two great men, whom he described as
bearded and patriarchal founding fathers of the psychologies on which our thinking on identity is based:
William James and Sigmund Freud (Erikson, 1968).
A man's character is discernible in the mental or moral attitude in which, when it came upon him, he
felt himself most deeply and intensely active and alive. At such moments there is a voice inside which speaks
and says:  This is the real me! (pg. 19; William James in a letter to his wife, cited in Erikson, 1968)
Moving beyond James' very personal description, Freud spoke of his Jewish identity as something that
provided a cultural context in which he lived his life, even though he was never religious, and openly
despised religion. He felt that he shared a Jewish cultural nature, which oered an explanation for, as well

as a justication for, aspects of his personality that deed any other obvious explanation.
Based on these perspectives by James and Freud, Erikson described identity as a process rooted in the
core of the individual, yet also rooted in the core of their communal culture.

This complicated process

involves both judging oneself in light of how others judge you, as well as judging the judgments others make
about you. Eventually, the interplay between psychological and social factors results in an identity based on

psychosocial relativity (Erikson, 1968). In other words, one's identity is very much inuenced by where
a person sees themselves tting into their world. Consequently, a person may develop a healthy identity, or
they can just as easily develop a negative identity (see below).
The term

identity crisis was rst used by Erikson during World War II, to describe a particular

psychological disorder.

They encountered patients, who had been ghting in the war, who had become

severely disturbed. However, they could not be described in the typical ways, such as being shell-shocked
or just faking mental illness to escape combat.

Instead, they had lost a sense of personal sameness and

historical continuity. Erikson proposed that they had lost the central control over that part of their self that
psychoanalysts could only describe as the ego. Thus, he described these patients as having lost their ego
identity. Since World War II, Erikson felt that he and his colleagues were observing the same fundamental
disorder in many severely conicted young patients. These disturbed individuals were, in a sense, waging
a war within themselves and against society.
individuals (Erikson, 1968).

An identity crisis of this sort can aect groups as well as

In an interesting, and somewhat amusing example of group identity crisis,

we can look at the reaction of the psychoanalytic community to the theories of Carl Jung.

In Erikson's

view, the psychoanalytic community reacted to Jung's proposal of the collective unconscious and archetypes
as a threat to scientic approach advocated by Freud.

Consequently, the majority of the psychoanalytic

community ignored Jung's reasonable observations as well as his somewhat less scientic interpretations
(Erikson, 1980a).

Obstacles to the Development of Identity
Erikson talked about two obstacles to the development of identity:

ratio and negative identity. Ratio

refers to the balance between the opposite poles of each psychosocial crisis: trust vs. mistrust, autonomy
vs. shame, etc. Although it may be best for the ratio to favor trust, autonomy, and so on, it is unreasonable
to expect a person to develop without any experience of trust being misplaced or without any feelings of
shame. This helps to ground the person in the real world, particularly as it is appropriate to the customs of
their culture (see Evans, 1964). Indeed, Erikson felt that identity could be viewed as being that subsystem
within the ego that is closest to social reality, based on the integrated self-representations formed during the
psychosocial crises of childhood. Thus, identity:

. . .could

be said to be characterized by the more or less

actually attained but forever-to-be-revised

sense

of the reality of the self within social reality; while the imagery of the ego ideal could be said to represent a
set of

to-be-strived-for but forever-not-quite-attainable ideal

goals for the self. (pg. 160; Erikson, 1980a)

Negative identity is often expressed as an angry and snobbish rejection of the roles expected by one's
family, community, or even society. It is a profound reaction to the loss of identity that typically arises when
identity development has lost the promise of wholeness that one expects to obtain from their identity. The
consequences can be severe, for both individuals and groups of young people. Erikson worked with young
people who were beginning to make choices in life that could easily lead them toward their vindictive fantasies
of becoming prostitutes or drug addicts (an extreme way of rebelling against their parents). As such disturbed
young people gather together, they can form gangs, drug rings, sex clubs, and the like (Erikson, 1968b, 1980a).
Society, according to Erikson, often makes the mistake of enhancing this maladaptive behavior:
If, for simplicity's sake or in order to accommodate ingrown habits of law or psychiatry, they diagnose
and treat as a criminal, as a constitutional mist, as a derelict doomed by his upbringing, or indeed as a
deranged patient a young person who, for reasons of personal or social marginality, is close to choosing a
negative identity, that young person may well put his energy into becoming exactly what the careless and
fearful community expects him to be - and make a total job of it. (pg. 196; Erikson, 1968b)
Erikson believed that women and minorities (indeed, oppressed people in any situation) face special
problems in the formation of their identity. Erikson considered men and women to be fundamentally dierent,
but more importantly, he believed that only women could ensure the future of humanity.

According to

CHAPTER 12. ERIK ERIKSON

292

Erikson, men try to solve problems with bigger and better wars.

And now, with the advent of nuclear

bombs, men have nearly reached the limit of their ability to destroy each other.

The future, therefore,

requires the feminine aspects of personality, including realistically caring for the home, responsibly raising
the children, being resourceful in peacekeeping, and devotion to healing:
The question arises whether such a potential for annihilation as now exists in the world should continue to
exist without the representation of the mothers of the species in the councils of image-making and decision.
(pg. 261; Erikson, 1968b)
For Blacks in America, the identity crisis has been one of being separated from their African heritage, and
yet also separated from the White American heritage that surrounds them. Erikson recounts both clinical
examples and folklore that emphasize the value placed on being White by Blacks themselves (Erikson, 1950,
1964, 1968, 1980a). The result is often psychological distress and depression, such as that seen in the classic
study by Kenneth and Mamie Clark, in which Black children considered identication with their race as bad.
Using Black and White dolls, some of the young Black children actually cried when asked to point to the
doll they looked most like (Clark & Clark, 1947). Perhaps the most dramatic example of Erikson's theory
in action occurred during the 1960s. Disenfranchised Blacks adopted a negative identity and opposed many
aspects of the American society that had oppressed Black's for so long (Note:

Negative

identity is used here

only as Erikson's term, not to imply that the ght for racial equality was, in any way, something negative).
With Malcolm X and the Nation of Islam, and Huey Newton and the Black Panthers, some young Black men
opposed both the Christianity and the Democracy that formed so much of the American national identity.
Those who did not, found themselves at odds with their own people, as we will see with Brian Copeland,
author of

Not a Genuine Black Man

(see Chapter 16; Copeland, 2006). It should be noted, however, that

the seemingly contradictory perspective of rejecting a society that gives one the very right to oppose it is
not alien to the African psyche:

. . .the

African gods south of the Sahara always had at least two heads, one for evil and one for good.

Now people create God in their own image, what they think He - for God is always a He in patriarchal
societies - what He is like or should be. So the African said, in eect: I am both good and evil; good and
evil are the two parts of the thing that is me. . . (pg. 24; Huey Newton, recorded in Kai Erikson, 1973)
The idea that Black Americans might have been adopting a negative identity was more than just an
academic theory for Erikson. In 1971, both Erikson and Huey Newton (who was then known as Supreme
Commander of the Black Panther Party) presented talks to the students of Yale University. A short time later,
they met again for a series of conversations in Oakland, California, which also included the Black sociologist
J. Herman Blake and Erikson's son, Kai Erikson, also a sociologist (see K. Erikson, 1973). Among many
topics, Newton described the revolutionary actions of Black activists at that time as a process, a contradiction
between old ways and new ways. Any change, he argued, might be viewed as revolutionary at a particular
point in time. Newton went on to describe how the Black community expected him to hate all White people,
and how the Black community rejected many of its own because they had too many Caucasian features (such
as relatively light skin). He rebelled against this discrimination, just as he did against the oppression that
was so inherent in American society. Erikson, for his part, talked mostly about just how dicult it is for
people of dierent backgrounds to understand each other's perspective. Most important, however, is the act
of searching for some basis for understanding one another (K. Erikson, 1973).
In his autobiographical book

Revolutionary Suicide

(the preparation of which was assisted by J. Herman

Blake; Newton, 1973), Newton begins with a tribute to a comrade who was killed in a shootout with the
police, while seeking nothing more than what Newton considered the right of all men: dignity and freedom.
He then oers a poem, which sounds very much like Taoist philosophy, as well as a search for a greater
identity:
By having no family,
I inherited the family of humanity.
By having no possessions,
I have possessed all.
By rejecting the love of one,
I received the love of all.

Discussion Question: Erikson described the adoption of a negative identity as a serious rejection of
one's expected place in life. Has there been a time in your life when you adopted a negative identity? Do
you feel that sometimes it is necessary to adopt a negative identity in order to change the world we live in?

Identity and the Role of the Family - Perspectives from Around the World
Identity is not merely a personal phenomenon, it develops within a cultural context that is passed on
through the family. The most important social institutions of the rst three stages of development are the
mother, then both parents, and nally, the family as a whole.

As adults, individuals face not only their

own psychosocial crises, but they serve as the parents of the next generation, as their children face the early
development crises.

Thus, it is important to consider the role that the family plays in general, and the

perspectives that can be oered by
It is dicult to dene the word

family psychology.
family, since it includes nuclear families (two-generations, with married

parents and their own children), extended families (three or more generations), foster and adoptive families
(which may be multi-racial and/or multi-cultural), single-parent families, gay or lesbian couples with or
without children, remarried/step families, and others (Kaslow, 2001). Further complicating matters is the
role the family plays as a microsystem of a given culture, especially when that culture is dramatically
altered. For example, when the former Soviet Union collapsed, the entire economic and political structure of
countries like Russia, Poland, East Germany, and Czechoslovakia were wiped out. When Yugoslavia broke
apart, ancient ethnic hatred led to brutal, local wars. The role that women play in many cultures has changed
in recent years, whereas in some cultures the patriarchal authority has aggressively retained its domination
of the culture. The Nobel Peace Prize for 2006 was awarded to Muhammad Yunus and the Grameen Bank
for developing micro-credit loans, most of which go to poor women in oppressive societies, in an eort to
help these women and their children rise out of poverty.
Family psychology addresses issues as complex as families themselves, including male-female relationships,
domestic violence, child-rearing and socialization practices, divorce, the search for identity in a dysfunctional
family setting, spirituality, drug addiction, war, crime and violence, homelessness, kidnapping, immigration,
etc. (Kaslow, 2001). When the members of a family face any of these problems, or perhaps a number of them,
family psychologists can help the individuals to retain their own sense of identity, in part by focusing on
reconstructing the social structure of the family (as opposed to focusing on diagnosing individual disorders).
Unfortunately, the problems facing families are common throughout the world. However, since the family is
the basic social structure within communities across all cultures, family therapy can play an important role
in helping to solve these problems. For example, family therapy has been used to study and treat a variety
of problems in dierent countries: conduct disorder in youth from the U.S. Virgin Islands (Dudley-Grant,
2001); community disasters, war stress, and the eects of immigration on Israeli families (Halpern, 2001);
and the refusal of some children in Japan to attend school (Kameguchi & Murphy-Shigematsu, 2001). In
each of these cultures the family is considered to play a particularly important role in identity formation.

Adulthood
Many theories on personality and cognitive development end with adolescence. As one enters into adulthood, it is assumed, one has accomplished all of the tasks necessary to be an adult, including one's identity.
And yet, if adolescence ends sometime in the late teens, many people can reasonably expect to live another
60 to 80 years.

Does it really make any sense to propose that nothing meaningful happens during those

years? Of course, Erikson described development stages throughout adulthood and old age, but what about
other psychologists?

Srivastava, et al.

(2003) examined changes in the Big Five personality traits across

the years of adulthood. They found that conscientiousness and agreeableness increased through early and
middle adulthood, whereas neuroticism decreased in women, but not in men. In other words, both men and
women become more responsible and cooperative as they grow through adulthood, and women become more
stable.

One can speculate that these changes t well within Erikson's model, in which most adults take

on the tasks involved in raising a family. Self-esteem rises steadily throughout adulthood, before dropping

294

sharply in old age (Robins & Trzesniewski, 2005). Similarly, the ability to integrate cognitive and aective
components of the self, in order to maintain positive self-development, increases steadily during adulthood
until beginning to decline with old age (Labouvie-Vief, 2003). Thus, adulthood does appear to be a time of
personality change.
Adulthood, however, means dierent things in dierent cultures. In

Adulthood

(Erikson, 1978), Erikson

brought together a collection of authors who examined adulthood from a variety of cultural perspectives.
For a Christian adult, growth occurs primarily through social experiences. One encounters Christ in service
to others, or in other words, by loving your neighbor.

Christ himself serves as the model for adulthood

(Bouwsma, 1978). Adulthood in Islam carries with it responsibility for the religious commands and obligations of Islam.

One must reconcile the reality of the world with one's place in it, as willed by Allah.

Adulthood then becomes an expression of the inner peace achieved by living in the world in accord with
the divinely revealed reality (Lapidus, 1978). In the Confucian tradition, adulthood is the complete process
of becoming a person. In this patriarchal model, rst a man comes of age, then he marries and has children, then he begins a career as a scholar-ocial, and that career is expected to be served with distinction
(Wei-Ming, 1978).

In Japan, adulthood is a time of social responsibility, discipline, and perseverance, in

preparation for the integrity and respect typically associated with old age (Rohlen, 1978). India presents
a particularly dicult challenge, and it is not really possible to speak of a single adulthood model.

The

caste system inherent in the India of the past created vastly dierent life conditions for the people of India
(Rudolph & Rudolph, 1978). The problems of language and multicultural populations create unique diculties for understanding adulthood in Russia and America (Jordan, 1978; Malia, 1978). What is clear across
cultures is that adulthood is a time of continued development, it can vary quite dramatically (even within
a culture), and it often involves an aspect of anticipating old age.

The anticipation of old age, however,

can vary dramatically, based on individual and cultural attitudes about old age, as we will see in the next
section.
Adulthood can be the most productive and, in some ways, most gratifying years of life.
unique challenges of adulthood have become popular topics in psychology, such as the

Some of the

midlife crisis and the

empty nest syndrome. And yet, adulthood is the least studied period of life. One possible explanation for
this neglect, according to Smelser (1980a), is that most research is done by adults, and they tend to be more
interested in stages of development other than their own. In a second collection of articles, entitled

Work and Love in Adulthood

Themes of

(Smelser & Erikson, 1980), Smelser and Erikson brought together a variety of

perspectives on what they viewed as two of the most important life phenomena that dominate the adulthood
years. Sigmund Freud is alleged to have said that maturity is to be found in the capacity to love and to
work. Throughout one's life, both of these phenomena follow certain paths, typically involving a period of
growing interest and ability, followed by a fairly stable level (which typically lasts for decades), followed by
a gradual (as in work) or sudden (as in the death of a spouse) decline (Smelser, 1980a). In examining the
relationship between Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung, evident in their letters to one another, Erikson (1980b)
found distinctly adult content related to such topics as mutual regard, condence, aection, intimate concern
for their families, both good and bad observations regarding their professional colleagues, and an ongoing
debate regarding the important issues in psychodynamic theory and the psychoanalytic movement. There
are similarities, but some interesting contrasts, between these letters and the ones Freud had written to
Wilhelm Fliess years earlier. In that younger period of adulthood, Freud seemed more in need of a close
friend, particularly since he was in the process of creating the eld that was becoming well-established by
the time Freud met Jung. Perhaps due to Freud being older when he met Jung, it seems that he interacted
with Fliess and Jung in dierent ways: when Freud was young he interacted with his colleague Fliess as a
colleague, but when he was older he interacted with Jung in a much more father-son type relationship (and
Jung had lost his father years earlier).
Work and love interact, or don't, depending on the nature of individual cultures.
America we compartmentalize our lives.

vice versa). Thus, a husband must balance the resources at his command

between his dierent wives and their children. As such, although love plays some role in marriage, it can
actually become a problem for that man who cannot maintain fair and equitable treatment of each wife and
her children. This is handled by maintaining a certain distance from each wife, including having his own
house, and visiting each wife on a rotating schedule that is acceptable to everyone (LeVine, 1980). Such a
concept of love and marriage is extraordinarily alien to the symbolic and mythic nature of the love ideal that
lies at the foundation of American culture: a man and a woman committed to one another in a way that
ennobles and transforms them both (Swidler, 1980).
However, the romantic vision of love in American culture is not without its drawbacks. The romantic,
passionate, committed love that Americans envision completes one's identity. In Erikson's terms, it stands
in opposition to isolation. However, it is all too common that most marriages, as well as other long-term
relationships, eventually come to an end. What then happens to each person's identity? Love also provides
a basis for rebellion, such as when a person marries for love in spite of the objections of one's family and/or
friends. Love can also lead to conformity, such as one sees in the term settling down or when women, in
particular, are expected to take on the primary responsibility for the household as an expression of their
love, even if they also have a job outside of the home as their husband does. When one partner, more so
than the other, must engage in self-sacrice, what happens to their opportunities for self-realization? If it
is possible to nd fulllment through the love of another, then self-sacrice can be self-realization (Swidler,
1980). If not, we might see high divorce rates. And a high divorce rate is the reality in America today.
So, whether love and work are intermingled or separate, whether simple or complex, whether fullling
or a necessary social expectation, they dominate the years of early and middle adulthood. No one period in
adulthood is more likely than another to result in change, as dierent stressors impact each age dierently.
Work related stress is particularly likely for the young adult, but older adults face the challenge of preparing
(both nancially and psychologically) for retirement, and unexpected changes can occur at any age. Love,
particularly as it relates to marriage, causes stress throughout adulthood, but in dierent ways. Younger
couples are more likely to experience separation and/or divorce, middle-aged adults experience their children leaving home and possible career transitions, and older couples are more likely to experience illness,
disabilities, and perhaps the loss of a spouse. Each of these dierent forms of stress brings with it a need for
coping mechanisms, and if those coping mechanisms fail, the likelihood for psychological distress becomes
very real (Pearlin, 1980). Perhaps the most challenging stressor in our lives, one that ultimately cannot be
overcome, but that may be transcended and accepted, is old age and our inevitable death.

Connections Across Cultures: Glorifying Youth vs. Valuing the Elderly
We hear a lot in our society about how we value youth, and consider the elderly to be of little worth.
The obsession with youth and appearance is such that plastic surgery has become the subject of numerous
television shows. But is our society really dierent than other societies, and if so, what factors might have
contributed to the dierence? The matter is particularly important today, since the world's older population
is the fastest growing group. One estimate has suggested by the year 2020 the total population of people
over 65 years of age will be 690 million (Hillier & Barrow, 1999). Thus, it won't be long before there are a
billion people over the age of 65. But is 65 years old a valid point for declaring someone as old?
Old age can be dened functionally, as in whether or not a person can still do the things expected of them
in their culture, it can be dened formally by some external event, such as the birth of the rst grandchild, or
it can be determined chronologically, as it typically is in the United States (we traditionally use the age of 65
years). Each measure has its advantages and disadvantages, but regardless, when a person is viewed by others
as old, the question becomes one of how they will be treated. Generally speaking, the more industrialized a
society is, the less likely it is to treat its elderly with respect and dignity. In non-industrialized societies, the
elderly play a number of important roles in the traditions and ceremonies emphasized by such cultures, since
they know the most about those traditions and ceremonies. Older members of the community function as
historians, vocational instructors, and often as doctors and ministers. In agrarian societies they continue to
work as long as they are able. As a result, the elderly are still vital, contributing members of the community,
and as such, they are naturally treated with the respect they deserve (Hillier & Barrow, 1999).
There are, however, variations even within non-industrialized societies. For example, nomadic societies
have few resources, and often live in harsh climates. Their geographic mobility favors youth and vigor, as well

as individual autonomy, all elements that fade with advanced age. Even with minor advances in technology,
the important roles that elders played in many cultures have faded with time. Among the Aleuts in Northern
Russia there were always one or two old men who educated the children. However, the availability of printed
material has largely eliminated the need for this type of education. In places such as Turkey and Nepal, the
elderly have lost their place in the workforce with the urbanization and industrialization of the country. The
Igbo of Nigeria once held their elders in high regard, but mass migrations have diminished their authority,
and formal education in schools has supplanted their spiritual roles (Hillier & Barrow, 1999). Many more
examples can be found of changes in how communities, societies, and cultures treat the elderly more poorly
than they have in the past.
As a result, many older people want to look and feel younger. Studies have shown that one's attitude
about their body image is positively correlated with their self-esteem, and that this holds true throughout
the lifespan.

In other words, people with high self-esteem feel good about their bodies, but people with

low self-esteem feel bad about their bodies.

People who are treated without respect or dignity, who feel

that they are being discarded by society, are likely to experience lowered self-esteem, and with it a lower
regard for their body image.

These people become easy targets for fraudulent cures for arthritis, cancer,

weight-loss, and sexual aids. It is estimated that Americans spend as much as $27 billion dollars a year on
quack medical products or services (Hillier & Barrow, 1999). There are also many products that do help
people look younger, so even more money is spent in a vain eort to pretend that people are younger than
they actually are.
Consider your own relationships with people who are much older, or if you are a bit older yourself,
with people who are younger than you.

Do you even have relationships with people of dierent ages, or

do such relationships tend to make you uncomfortable? How do you feel about the eorts of some people
to try looking younger? Has there been an older person in your life, perhaps a grandparent, who has had
a dramatic, positive inuence on who you are today? Try to imagine your life at 60 or 70 years old, and
how your children and grandchildren, or perhaps co-workers and friends, might treat you. Remember, your
attitudes and actions toward older people today might have a signicant eect on how your family and
friends act toward you when the roles are reversed.

Old Age and Death
In Western culture most people seem to focus on youth. Old age and death are to be avoided, even feared.
And yet, both are inevitable, unless we die young, something that is even less desirable than eventually dying
of old age. What is most curious, however, is that there is nothing in our culture to suggest that death is
something bad. Most people believe in life after death, and that good people go to Heaven. So why would
we want to avoid that? In many other cultures, death is not viewed with the same nality as it is in Western
culture, and ancestors are revered, and even worshipped. Even within Western culture, there are those who
embrace the later years in life, and who do not fear death. These are the perspectives we will examine here.

Growing Old: Or Older and Growing?
The title for this section was taken from an essay written by Carl Rogers (1980). Rogers was 75 years
old at the time, and he was looking back on the previous 10 years of his life. Rogers was experiencing a
number of physical problems associated with the natural deterioration of his body due to advanced age, such
as some loss of vision and arthritis in his right shoulder (making it impossible to enjoy playing Frisbee), but
he still enjoyed 4 mile walks on the beach and felt physically strong in many ways. As for his career, from
the age of 65 to 75 years old he had been very productive, publishing numerous books and articles. He also
led many workshops and encounter groups, including some that required him to travel around the world.
Professionally he began to take many risks, experimenting with his theories and workshops in ways he might
never have considered earlier in his career. As it became necessary for him to rely on others for help, due to
his slowing down with age, he also found that he was able to form far more intimate relationships with those
colleague/friends who helped him. Even as his wife approached death during those years, he found that the
struggle and pain led him to realize just how much he had loved her. Ten years later, as he turned 85 years
old, Rogers wrote another essay,

On Reaching 85

(Rogers, 1989). Once again, he had been very productive

during the 10 years between being 75 and 85 years old, most notably leading a number of peace conferences
that led to his nomination for a Nobel Peace Prize. He felt deeply privileged to have lived long enough to

see the great international inuence of his work. There can be little doubt that when his life ended, which
was actually before this essay was published (he wrote the essay, turned 85, and died 1 month later), he had
experienced integrity and wisdom:
I hope it is clear that my life at eighty-ve is better than anything I could have planned, dreamed of, or
expected. And I cannot close without at least mentioning the love relationships that nurture me, enrich my
being, and invigorate my life. I do not know when I will die, but I do know that I will have lived a full and
exciting eighty-ve years! (pg. 58; Rogers, 1989)
Erikson, in contrast, knew something of the despair that contrasts the integrity one hopes for in old age.
Never having known his own father, which resulted in an unending identity crisis, he struggled with feelings
of having been an inadequate father himself. As famous as he was, he desired the ultimate recognition of a
Nobel Prize, and was disappointed that

Ghandi's Truth only won a Pulitzer Prize.

He was also very sensitive

to criticism in any form. As his own daughter pointed out, it is a tragic irony that individuals such as Erikson
do not accept the vast majority of approval as commentary on their real self, but they do experience every
shred of criticism as being very real (Bloland, 2005). Erikson himself said that even when a person developed
a clear identity following adolescence, signicant life events later on can precipitate a renewal of the identity
crisis. One can only imagine the terrible psychological burden of sending away their baby Neil to die alone
and secretly in a hospital, only to have him live for 21 years. Under such circumstances, Erikson described
the search for a new identity as frantic (Evans, 1964).
One of the most interesting, important, and potentially enjoyable consequences of old age is the likelihood
that one has grandchildren.

All too often in American culture there are challenges to the relationships

between grandparents and grandchildren.

Families move across the country, they are broken apart by

divorce, and, in general, our culture does not place value on the experiences of the elderly. However, only
the elderly can provide generational continuity, which can be an important aspect of one's identity. For the
grandparents, they can play a vital role in supporting the emotional development of their grandchildren,
especially following a traumatic event such as divorce. They can provide adolescents with hope for continued
development and purpose throughout life, a prospect that might seem quite dicult for an adolescent to
comprehend on their own. And perhaps most importantly, they can simply spend quality time with their
grandchildren, without the burden of being responsible for the day-to-day raising of the child (Erikson, 1959;
Erikson & Erikson, 1997; Erikson, Erikson, & Kivnick, 1986). As shared by Joan Erikson, a grandmother and
her grandchild can congratulate themselves for doing a marvelous job picking blueberries, while experiencing
the reality of the life cycle:
After a while I did need to sit down on a rock and rest a bit, but not he. He continued for a moment or
so and then stood up very straight in front of me to clarify essentials. Nama, he said, you are old and I
am new - an unchallengeable pronouncement. (pg. 115; Erikson & Erikson, 1997)

Healthy relationships between grandparents and their grandchildren can benet everyone in the family.
In particular, grandparents provide a generational link that can help young people form their own identities.
While Carl Rogers and Joan Erikson seemed to accept old age and achieve integrity, Erik Erikson struggled
with despair, despite his international acclaim and many obvious accomplishments. Thus, it should become
clear that an individual's point of view is an important aspect of one's identity. In

Still Here

(Ram Dass,

2000), Ram Dass, a former Harvard University psychologist turned renowned guru of Bhakti Yoga and
Kirtan (see Chapter 17), acknowledges the challenges of old age:

physical problems, illness, loneliness,

embarrassment, powerlessness, loss of role/meaning, depression, and even senility. The suering associated
with these conditions is, however, self-induced, and one can choose mindfully to

not

suer. Whether or not

one suers, therefore, and whether or not one approaches the end of life with relative integrity or despair, is
in many ways a choice. And that choice will have a dramatic eect on the nal stage of life: death.

Death and Dying
It is important to begin by distinguishing between

death and dying. Death is the end of life, and as far

as scientic psychology is concerned, no one alive has been able to study death itself. Dying is a process that
occurs when death is imminent, but does not come immediately. The dying process begins either with old
age or the diagnosis of a terminal illness. Elisabeth Kubler-Ross is well-known for her research on the dying

On Death and Dying (1969): Denial and Isolation;
Anger; Bargaining; Depression; and Acceptance. When diagnosed with a terminal illness, most people

process, as are the ve stages that she described in

naturally respond with the common defense mechanism of denial, but there is more to it. Many psychology
textbooks do not address the second aspect of this rst stage: isolation. Denial is usually temporary, but
the dying person may still not be ready or even able to talk about their death, so they isolate themselves
psychologically. Unfortunately, hospital sta members often foster this isolation, because of their own fears
and discomfort regarding death.

Kubler-Ross and her colleagues found it quite dicult to stop hospital

sta members from encouraging the isolation of patients clinging to denial, including such simple tasks as
keeping the patient's door open so that people passing by could look in and vice versa. The nal stage of
acceptance, according to Kubler-Ross, is one that many patients do not achieve. Many people fear death,
and Western culture, due in part to its emphasis on science and medicine, and its movement away from
religion, encourages people to challenge death. But for those who ght, struggle, and hope to the very end,
even they eventually just cannot make it anymore (Kubler-Ross, 1969).

299

There are, however, many people who do come to accept the inevitability of death, either as a result of
illness or old age.

Erikson seemed to nally be at peace at the very end of his life, smiling whenever he

recognized his wife or daughter:
I was deeply touched on one visit to Dad when a ash of pleasure crossed his face as I entered the room,
and he said faintly to himself,

Meine Tochter

(my daughter in his native tongue). (pg. 204; Bloland, 2005)

Carl Rogers was largely unconcerned about death, he seldom thought about it. He was, however, quite
interested in the work of Kubler-Ross, particularly after he experienced his wife's dying process. One night,
when his wife was near death, he told her that she should not feel obligated to live, all was well with her
family, and that she should feel free to live or die, as she wished. After Rogers left that evening, his wife
called for the nurses, thanked them for all they had done, and told them she was going to die.

By the

next morning she was in a coma, and by the next day she was dead (Rogers, 1980). This experience was
profoundly moving for Rogers, and awakened a deep spirituality in him, but with a decidedly unscientic
aspect to it. Kubler-Ross joined Carl Jung in believing in synchronicity and the possibility of out-of-body
experiences, life after death, and the like (see Kubler-Ross, 1983, 1997).

Rogers also came to believe in

such possibilities. Helen Rogers reported seeing evil gures and the Devil by her hospital bed, as well as
a white light that would come and begin to lift her from the bed. Earlier the two of them had attended
sessions with a medium who claimed to be able to contact the dead.

Rogers was thoroughly convinced

that the medium's abilities were real, and that she had contacted Helen's deceased sister, and later Helen
Rogers herself. According to Rogers, each event was an incredible, and certainly non-fraudulent experience
(Rogers, 1980).
For the individual who is, indeed, about to die, what remains of life? Kubler-Ross, Joan Erikson, and
Ram Dass all see death itself as a nal stage of growth.

For Joan Erikson, when hope and trust can no

longer sustain the individual, to face down despair with faith and appropriate humility is perhaps the wisest
course, and one may then strive for gerotranscendence. Indeed, the ninth stage of development proposed by
Joan Erikson seems quite similar to the stage of acceptance proposed by Kubler-Ross (Erikson & Erikson,
1997). Ram Dass talks about the dierent perspective on death in India, and how it helped him to believe
that although the body and the mind, as well as their reection in the ego/self, could die, the soul was
something that would exist forever. Accordingly, it is more common in India, and in many other cultures,
to prepare for death. The failure to do so in America can have painful consequences:
When I was in my 30s, my mother was diagnosed with a terminal blood disorder. I went to visit her in
the hospital, and all the people around her were saying things like, You look great! You'll be home in no
time! But she looked terrible, and it was likely she'd never come home again. No one - not my father, her
sister or the rabbi - would tell her the truth. In that moment I saw just how isolated she was. She was dying
and no one would talk to her about death. We spoke about it, Soul to Soul, and she began to relax. (pg.
149; Ram Dass, 2000)
Kubler-Ross examined a variety of cultural perspectives on death, in a collection of essays entitled

The Final Stage of Growth (Kubler-Ross,

Death:

1975). Among Alaskan Indians the time of death was a choice. As

death approaches, if it does not come suddenly, the dying person would call together relatives and friends
for a time of storytelling and prayer. The dying person's life would be celebrated, and their death would
be accepted as an inevitable matter of fact (Trelease, 1975). In the Jewish faith, tradition holds that the
dying process should be met with eorts to alleviate distress as much as possible, but that death must also
be accepted as the decree of human mortality by the Eternal and Righteous Judge (Rabbi Heller, 1975). In
Hindu and Buddhist traditions, there is no death, but rather a common belief in rebirth. The circumstances
of one's rebirth, however, are determined by how one lived their most recent life (based on karma).

So,

one's life, as well as the preparations preceding the death of one's body in this life, is an important factor
in determining the nature of the next life. Of course, one can transcend this cycle of death and rebirth by
attaining enlightenment. Thus, it is common in countries like India and China to practice Yoga or Buddhist
meditation, as well as other spiritual practices, in order to either attain nirvana or, at least, a more favorable
circumstance in the next life (Long, 1975). Each of these traditions, as well as others, considers death to be
an important transition between this life and something beyond. It is in anticipation of something beyond
that death and dying should be approached, both in terms of one's actions and one's state of mind.

Personality Theory in Real Life:

. . .and in Death!

Arthur Benjamin Niemoller was a ne example of a man who had achieved integrity in old age, which
is not to say that his later years were entirely easy. As he prepared to travel from Ohio to Massachusetts
for the rst graduation of one of his grandchildren from college (me), his wife lapsed into a coma due to a
serious blood infection. Knowing it was unlikely that she would survive, or that she would even know if he
was there, he chose to attend my graduation. After the ceremony was over, and everyone returned to my
mother's house for a party, the call had come from the doctor. My grandmother had died. I spent the next
week in Ohio, helping my grandfather make the funeral arrangements for my grandmother. We had a service
in Montgomery, Ohio where they had lived for many years, and then another in Putnam, Connecticut, where
there is an old family graveyard. My grandfather made it very clear that he was glad he had attended my
graduation, because he was proud of his family and wouldn't have wanted to miss it.

Arthur Benjamin Niemoller (1912-1998) lived a long and full life. He exemplied dignity during his nal
years of life.
But the story doesn't end there.

I attended graduate school at Wayne State University in Detroit,

which isn't too far from the Cincinnati area, where Montgomery is located. I began visiting my grandfather
regularly, which was quite interesting because I'd had very little contact with him before that (my family has
never been close). He was a very active man. He was a Sunday school teacher and church council member at
the local Presbyterian church, he belonged to a retired men's club, he had season tickets to the opera, and
he regularly attended the symphony. He had many friends, some of whom had also lost their spouses to old
age. Most surprising, however, was that in his late 70s he joined two other men in forming a new company.
He was responsible for developing the computer programs that calculated the materials needed and the cost
of those materials for building an isolated phase bus (something for carrying industrial strength electrical
currents in power plants, I never really understood what he did). He was very proud of his work, and always
eager to show me his new computer programs. I was just as proud of him, and I am very pleased to be able
to say that he is the only person who attended all three of my college graduations (B.S., M.A., and Ph.D.).
We developed a relationship I will always treasure.
The last time I saw my grandfather, he had been given 3 weeks to live.

He had been suering from

dementia for several years, and typically wasn't sure who was visiting him. He thought I was his son Donny,
and it didn't help that my wife and my aunt are both named Donna. On that last day I saw him, he was
not the excited man of 80 years old who had a new computer program to show me. In fact, it took a while
for me to convince myself he was actually still alive. It is frightening to see what can happen to the human
body as a result of what is simply a natural process (old age, that is, dementia is certainly

not

a given with

old age). Before I left, I prayed to God, deeply and sincerely, that my grandfather would nally just die. I
was the last person in our family to see him alive. It is even more frightening, though merciful nonetheless,
to think that my prayer was answered. I was satised that his life had been a good one, and content that
his suering was ended.
Has there been anyone in your life who meant a great deal to you but who has died? Were you able to
participate in their dying process, and if so, how dicult was it? Imagine what it might be like to face death
yourself, and think about how you might want others to treat you. Do your feelings and expectations t
within the cultural expectations and/or traditions of your family and community?

12.1 Review of Key Points
•

Erikson never knew who his father was, and his relationship with his mother was never secure. This
challenge to his own identity led him to focus much of his career on the development of identity.

•

Erikson's theory was epigenetic, in that he believed people progress through a predictable series of
psychological stages.

•
•
•

At each stage, there is a unique and critical psychosocial crisis.
Play is the royal road to understanding the young child's ego, according to Erikson.
Before fully developing his theory, Erikson conrmed many of his observations in distinct cultures,
including two Native American tribes (Sioux and Yurok).

•

Erikson described eight stages of development: trust vs. mistrust; autonomy vs. shame/doubt; initiative vs. guilt; industry vs. inferiority; identity vs. role diusion/confusion; intimacy vs. isolation;
generativity vs. stagnation/self-absorption; and integrity vs. despair.

•

Each of the eight stages is associated with a particular strength: hope, will, purpose, competence,
delity, love, care, wisdom.

•
•

Sometimes young adults will take a moratorium during their search for an identity.
Joan Erikson proposed a ninth stage of development when death is imminent: despair vs. gerotranscendence.

•
•

Identity develops in relation to one's environment and culture. Thus, it involves psychosocial relativity.
Individuals who lose a sense of personal sameness and historical continuity may face an identity crisis.

CHAPTER 12. ERIK ERIKSON

•

Both the ratio of where one falls on each continuum of a psychosocial crisis and the possibility of
adopting a negative identity are challenges to healthy identity formation.

•

Erikson believed that the signicant challenges faced by young Blacks trying to nd an identity in
America, their disconnection from both their African heritage and the White majority in America, led
them toward adopting a negative identity.

Evidence can be found in the movement of some young

Blacks toward the Nation of Islam and the Black Panthers during the 1960s.

•

The family is an integral social institution in all cultures. Thus, family psychology can play an important role in helping individuals to recover from identity crises.

•

Adulthood is a time of continued psychological development, with its own unique psychosocial crises.
The form of these crises, however, varies dramatically from one culture to another.

•

In all cultures, the primary activities of adulthood, around which the psychosocial crises revolve, are
work and love.

•

Very old individuals can still be productive and creative.

Old age is also an important time for

grandparents to communicate a sense of continuity, a generational link, to their grandchildren.

•

Kubler-Ross described ve stages that occur during the dying process: denial and isolation, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. Unfortunately, many people never reach the stage of acceptance.

•

When faced with death itself, those who have achieved acceptance can transcend life, and die in
peace. Many non-Western cultures have dierent attitudes regarding death, and are able to facilitate
acceptance much more readily.

Chapter 13
Carl Jung

1

Carl Jung brought an almost mystical approach to psychodynamic theory. An early associate and follower
of Freud, Jung eventually disagreed with Freud on too many aspects of personality theory to remain within
a strictly Freudian perspective. Subsequently, Jung developed his own theory, which applied concepts from
natural laws (primarily in physics) to psychological functioning. Jung also introduced the concept of personality types, and began to address personality development throughout the lifespan. In his most unique
contribution, at least from a Western perspective, Jung proposed that the human psyche contains within
itself psychological constructs developed throughout the evolution of the human species.
Jung has always been controversial and confusing. His blending of psychology and religion, as well as his
openness to dierent religious and spiritual philosophies, was not easy to accept for many psychiatrists and
psychologists trying to pursue a purely scientic explanation of personality and mental illness. Perhaps no
one was more upset than Freud, whose attitude toward Jung changed dramatically over just a few years. In
1907, Freud wrote a letter to Jung in which Freud oered high praise:

. . .I

have already acknowledged. . .above all that your person has lled me with trust in the future, that

I now know that I am dispensable like everyone else, and that I wish for no one other or better than you to
continue and complete my work. (pg. 136; cited in Wehr, 1989)
In 1910, hoping that others would also support Jung, Freud wrote to Oskar Pster:
I hope you will loyally support Jung, I want him to acquire the authority that will entitle him to leadership
of the whole movement. (pg. 136; cited in Wehr, 1989)
However, in a dramatic shift just three years later, Freud wrote to Jung:
I suggest to you that we completely give up our private relationship.

By this I lose nothing, since

for a long time I have been bound to you emotionally only by the thin thread of previously experienced
disappointments.

...

Spare me the supposed duties of friendship. (pg. 136; cited in Wehr, 1989)

Later, in 1922, Freud thanked Oskar Pster for his help in trying to eliminate Jung's inuence on the
psychoanalytic community:
With your ever more thorough and ever more clearly demonstrated dismissal of Jung and Adler, you
have for a long time given me great satisfaction. (pg. 136; cited in Wehr, 1989)
Who was this man who inspired such profound condence from Sigmund Freud, only to later inspire such
contempt? And were his theories that dicult for the psychodynamic community, or psychology in general,
to accept? Hopefully, this chapter will begin to answer those questions. As evidence of his character, and in
contrast to Freud, Jung did not turn his back on his former mentor. Following Freud's death in 1939, and
later in 1957, Jung wrote the following:
[Freud's work was]. . .surely the boldest attempt ever made on the apparently solid ground of empiricism
to master the riddle of the unconscious psyche. For us young psychiatrists, it was a source of enlightenment. . .
(pg. 29; cited in Wehr, 1989)

CHAPTER 13. CARL JUNG

304

. . .Despite

the resounding censure I suered at the hands of Freud, I cannot, even despite my resentment

toward him, fail to recognize his importance as a critical analyst of culture and as a pioneer in the eld of
psychology. (pg. 39; cited in Wehr, 1989)

A Brief Biography of Carl Jung
At the beginning of his autobiography, entitled

Memories, Dreams, Reections, Jung (1961) described his

life as a story of the self-realization of the unconscious. Jung believed that our personality begins with a
collective unconscious, developed within our species throughout time, and that we have only limited ability
to control the psychic process that is our own personality. Thus, our true personality arises from within as
our collective unconscious comes forth into our personal unconscious and then our consciousness. It can be
helpful to view these concepts from an Eastern perspective, and it is interesting to note that self-realization
was used in the name of the rst Yoga society established in America (in 1920 by Paramahansa Yogananda).
th

Carl Gustav Jung was born on July 26

, 1875, in the small town of Kesswil, Switzerland, into an

interesting and notable family. His grandfather of the same name had been a physician, and had established
the psychiatric clinic at the University of Basel and the Home of Good Hope for mentally retarded children.
At an early age he had been imprisoned for over a year, for the crime of having participated in a demonstration
supporting democracy in Germany. Rumored to be an illegitimate son of the great Johann Wolfgang von
Goethe, though there is no convincing evidence, the elder Carl Jung died before his namesake grandson ever
knew him. Nonetheless, Jung was greatly inuenced by stories he heard about his grandfather. His maternal
grandfather, Samuel Preiswerk, was the dean of the Basel (Switzerland) clergy and pastor of a major church.
He was one the rst people in Europe to suggest a restoration of Palestine to the Jews, thus establishing
himself as a forerunner to the Zionists. Samuel Preiswerk also believed that he was regularly surrounded by
spirits (or ghosts), something that likely had quite an inuence on Jung's theories (Jae, 1979; Wehr, 1989).
Jung's father, Johann Paul Achilles Jung, married Emilie Preiswerk in 1874. Johann Jung was a scholar
of Oriental languages, studied Arabic, and was ordained a minister. In addition to being a pastor at two
churches during Jung's childhood, Johann Jung was the pastor at Friedmatt, the insane asylum in Basel.
During Jung's early childhood he did not always have the best of relationships with his parents. He considered
his mother to be a good mother, but he felt that her true personality was always hidden. She spent some
time in the hospital when he was three years old, in part due to problems in her marriage. Jung found this
separation from his mother deeply troubling, and he became mistrustful of the spoken word love.

Since

his father was a pastor, there were often funerals and burials, all of which was very mysterious to the young
Jung.

In addition, his mother was considered a spiritual medium, and often helped Jung with his later

studies on the occult. Perhaps most troubling of all, was Jung's belief that his father did not really know
God, but rather, had become a minister trapped in the performance of meaningless ritual (Jae, 1979; Jung,
1961; Wehr, 1989).
An only child until he was 9, Jung preferred to be left alone, or at least he came to accept his loneliness.
Even when his parent's guests brought their children over for visits, Jung would simply play his games alone:

. . .I

recall only that I did not want to be disturbed. I was deeply absorbed in my games and could not

endure being watched or judged while I played them. (pg. 18; Jung, 1961)
He also had extraordinarily rich and meaningful dreams, many of which were quite frightening, and they
often involved deeply religious themes. This is hardly surprising, since two uncles on his father's side of the
family were ministers, and there were six more ministers on his mother's side. Thus, he was often engaged
in religious discussions at home. He was particularly impressed with a richly illustrated book on Hinduism,
with pictures of Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva (the Hindu trinity of gods). Even at 6 years old, he felt a vague
connection with the Hindu gods, something that once again would have an interesting inuence on his later
theories. These dreams led Jung into deep religious speculations, something he considered to be a secret
that he could not share with anyone else (Jae, 1979; Jung, 1961; Wehr, 1989).
Jung's school-age years were a mixture of experiences. He enjoyed school, in the sense that it was easy
for him and he found other children to play with. However, he also began studying Latin with his father and
taking divinity classes. He found the classes on religion terribly boring, and the more he got to know his
father, the less he believed that his father understood either God, religion, or spirituality. It didn't help that
he was well-aware of the continued turmoil in his parent's marriage. In a cave in the garden he tended a re

305

that he meant to keep burning forever, and although he allowed other children to help gather the wood, only
Jung himself could tend the re. At the age of 11 he began attending the Gymnasium in Basel (something
like an advanced high school). The other children were quite wealthy, and Jung became aware of how poor
they were. Although this led him to feel some compassion for his father, the Gymnasium created a number
of problems. Jung simply did not understand mathematics, his divinity classes became unbearably boring,
and so, school itself became boring. This led to a severe neurosis at the age of 12 (Jae, 1979; Jung, 1961;
Wehr, 1989).
Jung had been knocked down by another boy on the way home from school. He hit his head on a rock,
and was nearly knocked out. He was so dizzy that others had to help him, and he suddenly realized that
he did not have to go to school if he was ill. Consequently, he began having fainting spells any time he was
sent to school or to do his homework. He missed 6 months of school due his psychological problems, and
Jung loved the opportunity to spend his days exploring the world in any way he wished. He was eventually
diagnosed with epilepsy, though Jung himself knew the diagnosis was ridiculous. One day he heard his father
expressing great fear to a friend about what would become of Jung if he were unable to earn his own living.
The reality of this statement was shocking to Jung, and From that moment on I became a serious child.
He immediately went to study Latin, and began to feel faint. However, he consciously made himself aware of
his neurosis, and cognitively fought it o. He soon returned to school, recognizing That was when I learned
what a neurosis is (Jae, 1979; Jung, 1961; Wehr, 1989).
As he continued through school, his personal life continued to be quite strange. He began to believe that
he was two people, one having lived 100 years earlier. He also had heated religious debates with his father.
Fueling his courage during these debates was his belief that a vision had led to his understanding of true
spirituality:
One ne summer day that same year I came out of school at noon and went to the cathedral square.
The sky was gloriously blue, the day one of radiant sunshine. The roof of the cathedral glittered, the sun
sparkling from the new, brightly glazed tiles. I was overwhelmed by the beauty of the sight, and thought:
The world is beautiful and the church is beautiful, and God made all this and sits above it far away in the
blue sky on a golden throne and

. . .

Here came a great hole in my thoughts, and a choking sensation. I felt

numbed, and knew only: Don't go on thinking now! Something terrible is coming, something I do not want
to think, something I dare not even approach. Why not? Because I would be committing the most frightful
of sins. What is the most terrible sin? Murder? No, it can't be that. The most terrible sin is the sin against
the Holy Ghost, which cannot be forgiven. Anyone who commits that sin is damned to hell for all eternity.
That would be very sad for my parents, if their only son, to whom they are so attached, should be doomed
to eternal damnation. I cannot do that to my parents. All I need do is not go on thinking. (pg. 36; Jung,
1961)
However, Jung was not able to ignore his vision. He was tormented for days, and spent sleepless nights
wondering why he would have to think something unforgivable as a result of praising God for the beauty
of all creation. His mother saw how troubled he was, but Jung felt that he could not dare conde in her.
Finally, he decided that it was God's will that he should face the meaning of this vision:
I thought it over again and arrived at the same conclusion.

Obviously God also desires me to show

courage, I thought. If that is so and I go through with it, then He will give me His grace and illumination.
I gathered all my courage, as though I were about to leap forthwith into hell-re, and let the thought
come. I saw before me the cathedral, the blue sky. God sits on His golden throne, high above the world and from under the throne an enormous turd falls upon the sparkling new roof, shatters it, and breaks the
walls of the cathedral asunder. (pg. 39; Jung 1961)
Jung was overjoyed by his understanding of this vision. He believed that God had shown him that what
mattered in life was doing God's will, not following the rules of any man, religion, or church. This was what
Jung felt his own father had never come to realize, and therefore, his father did not know the immediate
living God. This conviction that one should pursue truth, rather than dogma, was an essential lesson that
returned when Jung faced his dramatic split with Sigmund Freud.

behind. His cousin Helene Preiswerk led séances in which she would fall into a trance and channel strange

spirits. The climax of these trances was often a mandala (a mandala is a geometric gure that represents
wholeness, completeness, and perfection), which she would dictate to Jung, and then attempt to translate
what was told to her by the spirits. Eugen Bleuler urged Jung to publish his studies on occult phenomena

Pathology of So-called Occult Phenomena.

On the Psychology and

Another important event that occurred early during Jung's
The church had no provisions for the family of a deceased

minister, but one of his uncles loaned Jung the money he needed to continue his studies. Upon completing
medical school, he joined Dr.

Bleuler in Zurich at the Burgholzli Mental Hospital, and soon became the

rst assistant physician. The Burgholzli clinic was a renowned institution. Bleuler was considered one of the
two most inuential psychiatrists of the day, and the clinic had come to prominence under his predecessor
Auguste Forel, who was the rst person to formally publish the theory that neurons communicate through
synaptic junctions (though just how was not well understood at the time; Finger, 1994). Jung worked hard
at Burgholzli, as Bleuler expected nothing less. He also spent some time in France, at the internationally
recognized Salpetriere hospital, where he met Pierre Janet.

Janet is a curious gure in the history of

psychoanalysis. He claimed that he developed everything good in psychoanalysis, and that everything Freud
developed was bad.

Janet also apparently suggested that only the corrupt city of Vienna could be the

source of a theory that traces the development of personality to sexual urges (Freud, 1914/1995).

Jung

spoke favorably of what he learned from Janet; Freud soundly rejected Janet's claims, but did grudgingly
acknowledge that Janet did some important work on understanding neuroses (Freud, 1914/1995; Jung, 1961).
In 1906, Jung sent Freud a copy of his book

The Psychology of Dementia Praecox

(an earlier term for

schizophrenia), which Freud found quite impressive. The two met in February, 1907, and talked for nearly
13 straight hours. According to Jung, Freud was the rst man of real importance I had encountered. . .no
one else could compare with him. Very quickly, as evidenced in the letters quoted at the beginning of this
chapter, Freud felt that Jung would become the leader of the psychoanalytic movement. In 1909, Jung's
psychoanalytic practice was so busy that he resigned from the Burgholzli clinic, and he traveled to America
with Freud. During this trip the two men spent a great deal of time together. It quickly became evident to
Jung that he could not be the successor that Freud was seeking; Jung had too many dierences of opinion
with Freud. More importantly, however, Jung described Freud as neurotic, and wrote that the symptoms
were sometimes highly troublesome (though Jung failed to identify those symptoms).

Freud taught that

everyone was a little neurotic, but Jung wanted to know how to cure neuroses:
Apparently neither Freud nor his disciples could understand what it meant for the theory and practice
of psychoanalysis if not even the master could deal with his own neurosis. When, then, Freud announced
his intention of identifying theory and method and making them into some kind of dogma, I could no longer
collaborate with him; there remained no choice for me but to withdraw. (pg. 167; Jung, 1961)
Clearly Jung could not accept a dogmatic approach to psychoanalysis, since he believed that God Himself
had told Jung not to follow any rigid system of rules. Even worse, this was when Jung rst published his
discovery of the collective unconscious. Freud wholly rejected this concept, and Jung felt that his creativity
was being rejected. He oered to support Freud in public, while extending honest opinions in so-called secret
letters.

Freud wanted none of it. Almost as quickly as their relationship had grown, it fell apart (Jae,

1979; Jung, 1961; Wehr, 1989).
The loss of his relationship with Freud, following the loss of his father, led Jung in a period of personal
crisis.

He resigned his position at the University of Zurich, and began a lengthy series of experiments in

order to understand the fantasies and dreams that arose from his unconscious. The more he studied these
phenomena, the more he realized they were not from his own memories, but from the collective unconscious.
He was particularly curious about mandala drawings, which date back thousands of years in all cultures.
He studied Christian Gnosticism, alchemy, and the

I Ching

(or:

Book of Changes ).

After meeting Richard

Wilhelm, an expert on Chinese culture, Jung studied more Taoist philosophy, and he wrote a glowing
foreword for Wilhelm's translation of the

I Ching

(Wilhelm, 1950). These extraordinarily diverse interests

led Jung to seek more in-depth knowledge from around the world. He traveled rst to North Africa, then to
America (to visit Pueblo Indians in New Mexico), next came East Africa (Uganda and Kenya), and nally
India. Jung made every eort to get away from civilized areas, which might have been inuenced by other

307

cultures, in order to get a more realistic impression of the local culture, and he was particularly successful
in this regard in meeting gurus in India (Jae, 1979; Jung, 1961; Wehr, 1989).
Through it all, he continued his work in psychology. He had developed his concept of psychological types,
one of his most signicant contributions, and published his work shortly after the break with Freud.

He

continued to develop his own form of psychoanalysis. Jung's family was also an important part of his life.
He had married Emma Rauschenbach in 1903. They had four daughters and one son, followed by nineteen
grandchildren and many great-grandchildren. Emma Jung was very supportive of her husband, especially
during the more turbulent periods of his career (including the break with Freud), and she was no stranger
to his work. She had done some analytical work with Freud herself, she wrote essays on Jung's concept of

anima and animus, and she was the rst president of the Psychological Club of Zurich.

When his wife Emma

died in 1955, Jung wrote in a letter that the loss had taken a lot out of him, and that at his age (80 years
old) it wasn't easy to recover. Yet two years later, he began dictating his autobiography to Aniela Jae.
Looking ahead to the end of his life, Jung said:
The world into which we are born is brutal and cruel, and at the same time of divine beauty. Which
element we think outweighs the other, whether meaninglessness or meaning is a matter of temperament.
If meaninglessness were absolutely preponderant, the meaningfulness of life would vanish to an increasing
degree with each step in our development. But that is - or seems to me - not the case. Probably, as in all
metaphysical questions, both are true: Life is - or has - meaning and meaninglessness. I cherish the anxious
hope that meaning will preponderate and win the battle.
When Lao-tzu says: All are clear, I alone am clouded, he is expressing what I now feel in advanced
old age. Lao-tzu is the example of a man with superior insight who has seen and experienced worth and
worthlessness, and who at the end of his life desires to return into his own being, into the eternal unknowable
meaning. The archetype of the old man who has seen enough is eternally true. (pp. 358-359; Jung, 1961)
Carl Jung died at home in 1961, in Kusnacht, Switzerland, at the age of 85.

As psychologists today

examine more deeply the relationship between Eastern and Western perspectives, it may be that Jung's
legacy has yet to be fullled.

Discussion Question: Even as a child, Jung had vivid dreams that he believed were giving him insight
and guidance for the future. Have you ever had dreams so vivid, dreams that left such a powerful impression
on you, that you felt they must have some special meaning? How did you respond, and what consequences,
if any, followed your responses?

Placing Jung in Context: A Psychodynamic Enigma
Carl Jung holds an extraordinary place in the histories of psychiatry and psychology. Having already
been an assistant to the renowned psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler, he went to Vienna to learn more about the
edgling science of psychoanalysis. He became Freud's hand-picked heir to the psychoanalytic throne, and
was one of the psychiatrists who accompanied Freud to America. Later, however, as he developed his own
theories, he parted ways with Freud. Freud eventually came to describe Jung's theories as incomprehensible,
and Freud praised other psychiatrists who also opposed Jung's ideas.
The most dramatic contribution that Jung made to psychodynamic thought was his concept of the
collective unconscious, a mysterious reservoir of psychological constructs common to all people. Jung traveled
extensively, including trips to Africa, India, and the United States (particularly to visit the Pueblo Indians in
New Mexico), and he studied the cultures in those places. He also observed many basic similarities between
dierent cultures.

Those similarities led Jung to propose the collective unconscious.

How else could so

many signicant cultural similarities have arisen within separate and distant lands? Jung did not reject the
concepts already developed by Freud and Adler, including the dynamic interaction between the conscious
mind and the personal unconscious, but he extended them in order to connect them with his own theory
of our underlying collective unconscious. As strange as this theory seemed to Freud, and Freud wondered
whether it even made sense to Jung, such a concept is not dicult to understand from an Eastern perspective.
Initially Jung's theories had more inuence on art, literature, and anthropology than they did on psychiatry and psychology. More recently, however, cognitive-behavioral theorists have begun to explore mindfulness
as an addition to more traditional aspects of cognitive-behavioral therapies. As psychologists today study
concepts from Yoga and Buddhism that are thousands of years old, Jung deserves the credit for bringing

CHAPTER 13. CARL JUNG

308

such an open-minded approach to the modern world of psychotherapy. Many famous and inuential people
admired Jung's work, including psychiatrist Viktor Frankl, psychologist Erich Fromm, the authors Hermann
Hesse and H. G. Wells, and Nobel Laureate (Physics) Wolfgang Pauli (for a number of interesting testimonials see Wehr, 1989). In addition, Jung's discussion of how the libido has transformed throughout the
evolution of the human species sounds very much like sociobiology, which was not an established eld until
the 1970s. Clearly Jung did not simply dabble in a wide range of ideas, but rather, he had an extraordinary
vision of the complexity of the human psyche.

Basic Concepts
In order to distinguish his own approach to psychology from others that had come before, Jung felt that
he needed a unique name. Freud, of course, had chosen the term psychoanalysis, whereas Alfred Adler had
chosen individual psychology. Since Jung admired both men and their theories, he chose a name intended
to encompass not only their approaches, but others as well. Thus, he chose to call his approach

analytical

psychology (Jung, 1933).
Analytical psychology, as presented by Jung, addresses the question of the psyche in an open-minded
way. He laments the overly scientic approach of the late 1800s and eorts to explain away the psyche as a
mere epiphenomenon of brain function. Curiously, that debate remains with us today, and is still unanswered
in any denitive way. Jung did not accept the suggestion that the psyche must come from the activity of
the brain.

This allowed him to consider the possibility of a collective unconscious, and t well with his

acceptance of the wisdom of Eastern philosophers. Indeed, Jung suggests that psychology will nd truth
only when it accepts both Eastern and Western, as well as both scientic and spiritual, perspectives on the
psyche (Jung, 1933).

Dynamic Psychic Energy
Jung believed in a dynamic interaction between the conscious and unconscious minds, in a manner quite
similar to that proposed by Freud. However, as we will examine below, his concept of the psyche included
elements of an unconscious mind that transcends the individual, and may be considered a combination
of the spirit, or soul, and one's thoughts and sensations. This inner psychic realm is capable of aecting
the brain and its functions and, therefore, can inuence one's perception of external reality.

In addition,

Jung thought of the libido somewhat dierently than Freud. Although Jung considered sexuality to be an
important aspect of the libido, primarily he thought of libido as a more generalized life energy (Douglas,
1995; Jarvis, 2004).

Jung believed that as the human species evolved, the nature of sexual (or survival)

impulses transformed. For example, early in human evolution we needed, as do other species, to be able to
attract mates for procreation. Over time, these attraction behaviors generalized to behaviors such as art or
music. Thus, a Freudian might say that creating music is a sexual act, but according to Jung it would be a
poor, unaesthetic generalization if one were to include music in the category of sexuality (Jung, 1916/1963).
An important element of Jung's conception of the psyche and libido is found in the nature of opposites.
Indeed, all of nature is composed of opposites:

. . .The

concept of energy implies that of polarity, since a current of energy necessarily presupposes two

dierent states, or poles, without which there can be no current. Every energic phenomenon. . .consists of
pairs of opposites: beginning and end, above and below, hot and cold, earlier and later, cause and eect,
etc. The inseparability of the energy concept from that of polarity also applies to the concept of libido. (pg.
202; Jung, 1971)

. . .opposites

are the ineradicable and indispensable preconditions of all psychic life. . . (pg.

170; Jung,

1970)
In accordance with this view, Jung felt that the psyche sought balance, much like the concept of

entropy

from the eld of physics. Entropy, in simple terms, is a thermodynamic principle that all energy within a
system (including the universe) will eventually even out. Jung applied this principle to motivation, believing
that we are driven forward through our lives in such a way that we might reduce the imbalance of psychic
energy between opposing pairs of emotions (such as love and hate; Jarvis, 2004; Jung, 1971). Borrowing
concepts from physics was certainly not a strange thing for Jung to do. As mentioned in Chapter 3, Freud's
theories were motivated in part by advancements in science and Darwin's theory of evolution.

Jung was

personally acquainted with the Nobel Prize winning physicist Wolfgang Pauli, and the two published essays

blending psychology and physics in a book entitled

The Interpretation of Nature and the Psyche

(Jung &

Pauli, 1955). However, entropy and motivation are focused forward in time. Such an orientation toward the
future marks another distinction between the theories of Freud and Jung.
Jung did not simply study symbolism, such as that in dreams, to uncover evidence of past repression.
Jung believed that dreams could guide our future behavior, because of their profound relationship to the
past, and their profound inuence on our conscious mental life.

Jung proposed that dreams can tell us

something about the development and structure of the human psyche, and that dreams have evolved with
our species throughout time. Since consciousness is limited by our present experience, dreams help to reveal
much deeper and broader elements of our psyche than we can be aware of consciously.
cannot easily be interpreted.

As such, dreams

Jung rejected the analysis of any single dream, believing that they belong

within a series. He also rejected trying to learn dream analysis from a book. When done properly, however,
dream analysis can provide unparalleled realism (see Jacobi & Hull, 1970; Jung, 1933):

. . .I

cannot prove in every case that dreams are meaningful, for there are dreams that neither doctor nor

patient understands. But I must regard them as hypothetically meaningful in order to nd courage to deal
with them at all. . .We must never forget in dream-analysis, even for a moment, that we move on treacherous
ground where nothing is certain but uncertainty. . .When we take up an obscure dream, our rst task is not
to understand and interpret it, but to establish the context with minute care. What I have in mind is not
a boundless sweep of free associations starting from any and every image in the dream, but a careful and
conscious illumination of those chains of associations that are directly connected with particular images.
(pp. 11-12; Jung, 1933)
In the nal analysis, there is a particular challenge to understanding what dreams point to, and that is
the situation under which a therapist typically learns of someone's dreams: in therapy. Jung suggested that
if therapists could continue to observe the journey of one's dreams after therapy was successful, then the
therapist, and possibly the client as well, might begin to more clearly understand the meaning and direction
of the dreams. Still, dreams themselves are about both health and sickness, in keeping with Jung's principle
of opposites. As such, Jung wrote that dreams are the natural reaction of the self-regulating psychic system.
The theory of entropy allows for an imbalance of energy in a closed-system. We may think of our conscious
mind as just such a closed system. When we dream, however, the ongoing eort of our psyche to balance
itself takes over, and the dreams counteract what we have done to imbalance our psychological selves. Thus,
it is within the context of dreams, not the details, that meaning is to be found (Jung, 1959a, 1968).

Discussion Question: Jung believed that the source of our motivation was a psychological drive to
achieve balance (the eect of entropy on the psyche).

Have you ever felt that you were being pushed or

pulled in the wrong direction, or in too many directions at once, and simply wanted to achieve some balance
in your life? In contrast, have there been times that your life was unfullling, and you needed something
more in order to feel whole?

The Unconscious Mind
Perhaps Jung's most unique contribution to psychology is the distinction between a personal unconscious and a collective unconscious. The personal unconscious is not entirely dierent than that proposed
by Freud, but is more extensive. In addition to repressed memories and impulses, the personal unconscious
contains undeveloped aspects of the personality and material arising from the collective unconscious that is
not yet ready for admission into conscious awareness. The personal unconscious is revealed through clusters
of emotions, such as those resulting in a particular attitude toward one's father or other father gures, which
Jung referred to as a

complex (Douglas, 1995; Jarvis, 2004). In this sense, a complex is not synonymous

with a psychological problem, as the term is often used today, but rather any general state of mind common
to certain situations. In this context, it is quite similar to the

schemas discussed by cognitive theorists.

Jung arrived at his theory of complexes as a result of his research into schizophrenia, under the direction
of Dr.

Bleuler.

Bleuler had assigned Jung the task of studying the

Word Association Test, a test in

which a list of 100 words is read to the patient, and the therapist watches for evidence of emotional arousal,
such as pauses, failures to respond, or physical acts. In addition, Jung noticed that even with schizophrenic
patients, the patterns of word association were often centered on a particular theme. That theme could then
be regarded as a complex (which, again, could be either positive or negative). Sometimes, complexes remain

CHAPTER 13. CARL JUNG

310

unresolved, such as one's feelings about parents, if the parents have died. In relatively healthy individuals,
these unresolved complexes could result in dreams, visions, or similar phenomena pertaining to the object(s)
of the unresolved complex.

These complexes might even become personied.

In the extreme situation

of personied complexes, such as in a person suering from schizophrenia, the patient cannot distinguish
the personication of the unresolved complex from the seeming reality of being another person.

Hence,

the schizophrenic hears voices in their head, spoken by someone else. As Jung further investigated the
nature and themes of complexes in psychiatric patients, he found common themes that could not always
be attributed to the patient's personal history.

And so, he began to form his concept of the collective

unconscious (Douglas, 1995; Jarvis, 2004; Jung, 1959b, 1961; Storr, 1983).

. . .from the standpoint of the psychology of the personality a twofold division ensures: an extra-conscious
personal, and an extra-conscious psyche whose contents are impersonal and
collective. The rst group comprises contents which are integral components of the individual personality
psyche whose contents are

and could therefore just as well be conscious; the second group forms, as it were, an omnipresent, unchanging,
and everywhere identical

quality or substrate of the psyche per se.

This is, of course, no more than a

hypothesis. But we are driven to it by the peculiar nature of the empirical material. . .
Whereas the contents of the personal unconscious are acquired during the individual's lifetime, the
contents of the collective unconscious are invariably archetypes that were present from the beginning. (pp.
7-8; Jung, 1959c)
Thus, according to Jung, the collective unconscious is a reservoir of psychic resources common to all
humans (something along the lines of psychological instinct). These psychic resources, known as

archetypes,

are passed down through the generations of a culture, but Jung considered them to be inherited, not learned.
As generation after generation experienced similar phenomena, the archetypal images were formed. Despite
cultural dierences, the human experience has been similar in many ways throughout history. As such, there
are certain archetypes common to all people. According to Jung, the most empirically valid archetypes, and
therefore the most powerful, are the

shadow, the anima, and the animus (Jung, 1959c).

Jung described the shadow as the inferior and less commendable part of a person, and a moral problem
that challenges the whole ego-personality (Jung, 1940, 1959c). It encompasses desires and feelings that are
not acceptable to society or the conscious psyche.

With eort the shadow can be somewhat assimilated

into the conscious personality, but portions of it are highly resistant to moral control. As a result, we tend
to project those thoughts, feelings, or emotions onto other people.

When they have moved beyond one's

control, such as when we lose our temper, these projections isolate the individual from their environment,
since they are no longer approaching situations realistically. Jung described the circumstance as tragic when
people continue to ruin their lives, and the lives of others, because they cannot see through the illusion of
how their shadow has been projected, and consequently interfered with their ability to live a healthy life
(Jung, 1959c).
The shadow is not, however, entirely evil. Rather, Jung described it as un-adapted and awkward, much
like a child trying to function in the company of adults. Trying to entirely suppress the shadow is not the
appropriate solution, since the shadow is driving us forward in our eorts to achieve balance between the
unconscious and conscious realities.

In other words, just as a child may act inappropriately while trying

to grow up, the shadow may cause inappropriate behavior in opposition to the accepted rules of society.
Nonetheless, it is important for us to have that driving force pushing us toward self-development (and the
development of the human species), so that we don't simply live a life of passivity and/or reaction to outside
events. It is the shadow that pushes us forward (Jacobi & Hull, 1970; Jung, 1961).
Although many people emphasize the dierences between men and women, psychologically their common
traits can readily be observed. Jung described the anima as the female aspect of the male psyche, and the
animus as the male aspect of the female psyche.

Jung intentionally addresses this dicult concept in

mythological terms, but he also makes it clear that this is a natural phenomenon for each person, and not
a substitute for one's mother (in the case of the anima) or father (in the case of the animus). While the
presence of a feminine aspect within the male psyche and the presence of a masculine aspect within the female
psyche have some positive benets, such as making it possible for men and women to relate to one another,
the unfortunate reality is often the opposite. In 1959(c), Jung described the diculties that men and women

Available for free at Connexions <http://cnx.org/content/col11901/1.1>

311

have relating to family and friends of the opposite sex, due to fundamental dierences in style. Although
men may contain the anima, they are still primarily masculine, whereas women, despite the animus, are still
primarily feminine. As with the shadow, relationship problems can arise from the anima or animus when we
allow our archetypal image to be projected onto others. As Jung himself noted, many men project a desired
image onto a woman that would require her to be a sexually vivacious virgin, something of a contradiction
in terms. Thus, over time, such a man's relationships may suer as a result of his learning more about the
real life of his companion, even though she has done nothing but be herself (Jung, 1940, 1959c).
Jung did not place a limit on the number of possible archetypes, and he described quite a few in his
writings. It did not matter to Jung whether archetypes were, in fact, real. In a perspective quite similar to
cognitive theorists, he wrote that insofar as the archetypes act upon me, they are real and actual to me,
even though I do not know what their real nature is (Jung, 1961). One of the more important archetypes is
the self, which represents the integration of the whole personality. Indeed, Jung described the self as the goal
of all psychic development. A special type of image often associated with the self, and with Jung himself, is
the

mandala. A mandala is a geometric gure that represents wholeness, completeness, perfection (Jung,

1958).

They also tend to be symmetrical, representing the natural balance of opposites.

Although they

typically have religious or spiritual signicance, it is not required. Jung was very interested in mandalas,
and from 1916 to 1918 he draw a new one every morning (Wehr, 1989). Mandalas can appear in dreams as
an image of wholeness, or in times of stress they may appear as compensatory images (Douglas, 1995). Their
potential healing ability stems from their connection between the uniqueness of our present consciousness
and the depths of our primordial past:

. . .The

psyche is not of today; its ancestry goes back many millions of years. Individual consciousness is

only the ower and the fruit of a season, sprung from the perennial rhizome beneath the earth; and it would
nd itself in better accord with the truth if it took the existence of the rhizome into its calculations. For the
root matter is the mother of all things. (pg. xxiv; Jung, 1956)
It is important to note that archetypal images are considered to be ancient.

Although we talk about

them as if they are still forming, and that may well be possible, the fact is that there were countless human
generations long before recorded history. Jung has referred to archetypes as primordial images, impressed
upon the mind since of old (Jung, 1940). Archetypes have been expressed as myths and fables, some of
which are thousands of years old even within recorded history. As the eternal, symbolic images representing
archetypes were developed, they naturally attracted and fascinated people.

That, according to Jung, is

why they have such profound impact, even today, in our seemingly advanced, knowledgeable, and scientic
societies.

Discussion Question: What is your impression of the concept of archetypes? Think about mythic
heroes and gods, or concepts of motherhood or being a father.

Can you identify commonalities between

dierent cultures, now or throughout time, which seem to suggest themes that are common to all people?

Connections Across Cultures: Symbolism
Throughout Time and Around the world
Near the end of Jung's life, he was asked to write a book that might make his theories more accessible
to common readers. Jung initially refused, but then he had an interesting dream, receiving advice from his
unconscious psyche that he should reconsider his refusal:

. . .He dreamed that, instead of sitting in his study and talking to the great doctors and psychiatrists who
used to call on him from all over the world, he was standing in a public place and addressing a multitude
of people who were listening to him with rapt attention and
Freeman, in his introduction to

Man and His Symbols,

understanding what he said . . .

(pg. 10; John

Jung et al., 1964)

Jung then agreed to write the book that became known as

Man and His Symbols,

but only if he could

hand-pick the co-authors who would help him. Jung supervised every aspect of the book, which was nearly
nished when he died. Written purposefully to be easily understood by a wide audience, the book presents
an astonishingly wide variety of symbolism from art, archaeology, myth, and analysis within the context of
Jung's theories.

Many of the symbols were represented in dreams, and symbolic dreams are the primary

means by which our unconscious psyche communicates with our conscious psyche, or ego. It is extraordinary
to see how similar such symbolism has been throughout time and across cultures, even though each individual
example is unique to the person having the dream or expressing themselves openly.

The Integra

Symbols, according to Jung, are terms, names, images, etc. that may be familiar in everyday life, but as
symbols they come to represent something vague and unknown, they take on meaning that is hidden from
us.

More specically, they represent something within our unconscious psyche that cannot ever be fully

explained. Exploring the meaning will not unlock the secrets of the symbol, because its meaning is beyond
reason. Jung suggests that this should not seem strange, since there is nothing that we perceive fully. Our
eyesight is limited, as is our hearing. Even when we use tools to enhance our senses, we still only see better,
or hear better. We don't comprehend the true nature of visual objects or sounds, we only experience them
dierently, within our psychic realm as opposed to their physical reality. And yet, the symbols created by
our unconscious psyche are very important, since the unconscious is at least half of our being, and it is
innitely broader than our conscious psyche (Jung et al., 1964).
Jung believed that the symbols created in dreams have a deeper meaning than Freud recognized. Freud
believed that dreams simply represent the unconscious aspects of one's psyche.

Jung believed, however,

that dreams represent a psyche all their own, a vast and ancient psyche connected to the entire history of
humanity (the collective unconscious). Therefore, dreams can tell a story of their own, such as Jung's dream
encouraging him to write a book for a common audience. Thus, his dream did not reect some underlying
neurosis connected to childhood trauma, but rather, his unconscious psyche was pushing him forward, toward
a sort of wholeness of self by making his theories more readily accessible to those who are not suciently
educated in the wide variety of complex topics that are typically found in Jung's writings. By virtue of the
same reasoning, Jung considered dreams to be quite personal. They could not be interpreted with dream
manuals, since no object has any xed symbolic meaning.
What makes the symbolism within dreams, as well as in everyday life, most fascinating, however, is
how common it is throughout the world, both in ancient times and today. In their examination of symbols
and archetypes, Jung and his colleagues oer visual examples from: Egypt, England, Japan, the Congo,
Tibet, Germany, Belgium, the United States, Bali, Haiti, Greece, Switzerland, Spain, Italy, Cameroon, Java,
France, Kenya, India, Sweden, Russia, Poland, Australia, China, Hungary, Malaysia, Borneo, Finland, the
Netherlands, Rhodesia, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Scotland, Ireland, Brazil, Monaco, Burma, Bolivia, Cambodia,
Denmark, Macedonia, and Peru, as well as from Mayan, Celtic, Babylonian, Persian, Navaho, and Haidu
cultures. There are also many Biblical references. It would be safe to say that no one else in the history
of psychology has so clearly demonstrated the cross-cultural reality of their theory as is the case with Carl
Jung.
Of course, as with dreams, many of these symbols are unique to the culture in which they have arisen.
Therefore, it takes a great deal of training and experience for a psychotherapist to work with patients
from dierent cultures. Nonetheless, the patterns represent the same basic concepts, such as self, shadow,
anima, animus, hero, etc.

Once recognized in their cultural context, the analyst would have a starting

point from which to begin working with their patient, or the artist would understand how to inuence their
audience. One important type of art that relies heavily on cultural images and cues is advertising. Cultural
dierences can create problems for companies pursuing global marketing campaigns. Jung's theory suggests
that similarities in how we react to certain archetypal themes should be similar in dierent countries, but
of course the images themselves must be recognizable, and we may still be a long way from understanding
those fundamental images:

. . .Our

actual knowledge of the unconscious shows that it is a natural phenomenon and that, like Nature

herself, it is at least

neutral.

It contains all aspects of human nature  light and dark, beautiful and ugly,

good and evil, profound and silly. The study of individual, as well as of collective, symbolism is an enormous
task, and one that has not yet been mastered. (pg. 103; Jung et al., 1964)

Personality Types
One of Jung's most practical theories, and one that has been quite inuential, is his work on personality
types. Jung had conducted an extensive review of the available literature on personality types, including perspectives from ancient Brahmanic conceptions taken from the Indian Vedas (see below) and types described
by the American psychologist William James.

In keeping with one of Jung's favorite themes, James had

emphasized opposing pairs as the characteristics of his personality types, such as rationalism vs. empiricism,
idealism vs. materialism, or optimism vs. pessimism (see Jung, 1971). Based on his research and clinical

experience, Jung proposed a system of personality types based on

attitude-types and function-types

(more commonly referred to simply as attitudes and functions). Once again, the attitudes and functions are
based on opposing ways of interacting with one's environment.
The two attitude-types are based on one's orientation to external objects (which includes other people).
The

introvert is intent on withdrawing libido from objects, as if to ensure that the object can have no
extravert extends libido toward an object, establishing an active

power over the person. In contrast, the

relationship. Jung considered introverts and extraverts to be common amongst all groups of people, from
all walks of life. Today, most psychologists acknowledge that there is a clear genetic component to these
temperaments (Kagan, 1984, 1994; Kagan, Kearsley, & Zelazo 1978), a suggestion proposed by Jung as well
(Jung, 1971). Of course, one cannot have an orientation to objects without consciousness, and consciousness
cannot exist without an

ego. For Jung, the ego is a complex, so it is associated with both the conscious

psyche and the personal unconscious. According to Jung, it is always in the center of our attention and of
our desires, and it is the absolutely indispensable centre of consciousness (Jung, 1968).
Jung's four functions describe ways in which we orient ourselves to the external environment, given our
basic tendency toward introversion or extraversion.

the course that satises your more immediate interests. The second opposing pair of functions is

In contrast, intuition incorporates a sense of time, and allows for hunches. Intuition may

seem mysterious, and Jung freely acknowledges that he is particularly mystical, yet he oers an interesting
perspective on this issue:

. . .Intuition

is a function by which you see round corners, which you really cannot do; yet the fellow will

do it for you and you trust him. It is a function which normally you do not use if you live a regular life
within four walls and do regular routine work. But if you are on the Stock Exchange or in Central Africa,
you will use your hunches like anything. You cannot, for instance, calculate whether when you turn round a
corner in the bush you will meet a rhinoceros or a tiger - but you get a hunch, and it will perhaps save your
life. . . (pg. 14; Jung, 1968)
The two attitudes and the four functions combine to form eight personality types.

Jung described a

so-called cross of the functions, with the ego in the center being inuenced by the pairs of functions (Jung,
1968). Considering whether the ego's attitude is primarily introverted or extraverted, one could also propose
a parallel pair of crosses.

Jung's theory on personality types has proven quite inuential, and led to the

development of two well-known and very popular instruments used to measure one's personality type, so
that one might then make reasoned decisions about real-life choices.

Think about yourself

Can you use the eight types described by Jung

to get a reasonable impression of the people you know, or does Jung's theory seem to fall short?
In 1923, Katharine Briggs and her daughter Isabel Briggs Myers learned of Jung's personality types and
became quite interested in his theory. After spending 20 years observing individuals of dierent types, they
added one more pair of factors based on a person's preference for either a more structured lifestyle, called

judging, or a more exible or adaptable lifestyle, called perceiving. There were now, according to Briggs
In the 1940s, Isabel Myers began developing the MyersBriggs Type Indicator (MBTI) in order to help people learn about their personality type. To provide just

one example of an MBTI prole, an individual who is extraverted and prefers sensing, thinking, and judging
(identied by the initials ESTJ) would be described as: Practical, realistic, matter-of-fact. Decisive, quickly
move to implement decisions. Organize projects and people to get things done. . .Forceful in implementing
their plans (Myers, 1993; Myers & McCaulley, 1985; see also the website for the Myers & Briggs Foundation,
at www.myersbriggs.org). While it is relatively easy to nd shortcut tests or variations of the MBTI online,
if one plans to make any meaningful decisions based on their personality type they should consult a trained
MBTI administrator. What sort of decision might one make? The MBTI has become a popular tool for
looking at career choices and workplace relationships. A number of popular books, such as
(Tieger & Barron-Tieger, 2001) and

Type Talk at Work

Do What You Are

(Kroeger, Thuesen, & Rutledge, 2002), are available

that provide information intended to help people choose satisfying careers and be successful in complex work
environments. In addition to its use in career counseling, the MBTI has been used in individual counseling,

marriage counseling, and in educational settings (Myers, 1993; Myers & McCaulley, 1985; Myers & Myers,
1980). Another popular instrument, based once again on Jung's theory and compared directly to the MBTI,
is the

Keirsey Temperament Sorter. David Keirsey uses plain language in an eort to make personality

types easy to comprehend.

Setting aside introversion vs.

extraversion, he has identied eight character

portraits: mentors, organizers, monitors, operators, advocates, engineers, conservators, and players. When
Keirsey adds extraversion and introversion back into the mixture, he can identify one's personality type
even more clearly:

monitors become either supervisors (E) or inspectors (I), players become performers

(E) or composers (I), engineers become inventors (E) or designers (I), etc.

As with the MBTI, Keirsey

provides concrete recommendations regarding how one might use the results of his temperament sorter to
make decisions about one's choices in life (Keirsey, 1987).

Personality Development
Jung believed that everyone's ultimate aim and strongest desire lie in developing the fullness of human
existence that is called personality (Jung, 1940). However, he lamented the misguided attempts of society
to educate children into their personalities. Not only did he doubt the abilities the average parent or average
teacher to lead children through the child's personality development, given their own personal limitations,
he considered it a mistake to expect children to act like young adults:
It is best not to apply to children the high ideal of education to personality. For what is generally understood by personality - namely, a

with energy

denitely shaped, psychic abundance, capable of resistance and endowed
deniteness, fullness, and maturity.

- is an adult ideal. . .No personality is manifested without

These three characteristics do not, and should not, t the child, for they would rob it of its childhood. (pp.
284-285; Jung, 1940)
This is not to suggest that childhood is simply a carefree time for children:
No one will deny or even underestimate the importance of childhood years; the severe injuries, often
lasting through life, caused by a nonsensical upbringing at home and in school are too obvious, and the need
for reasonable pedagogic methods is too urgent. . .But who rears children to personality? In the rst and
most important place we have the ordinary, incompetent parents who are often themselves, all their lives,
partly or wholly children. (pg. 282; Jung, 1940)
So, if childhood is a critical time, but most adults never grow up themselves, what hope does Jung see
for the future? The answer is to be found in midlife. According to Jung, the middle years of life are a time
of supreme psychological importance and the moment of greatest unfolding in one's life (cited in Jacobi &
Hull, 1970). In keeping with the ancient tradition of the Vedic stages of life, from Hindu and Indian culture,
the earlier stages of life are about education, developing a career, having a family, and serving one's proper
role within society:
Man has two aims:

The rst is the aim of nature, the begetting of children and all the business of

protecting the brood; to this period belongs the gaining of money and social position.

When this aim is

satised, there begins another phase, namely, that of culture. For the attainment of the former goal we have
the help of nature, and moreover of education; but little or nothing helps us toward the latter goal... (pg.
125; Jung, cited in Jacobi & Hull, 1970)
So where does one look for the answers to life? Obviously, there is no simple answer to that question,
or rather, than are many answers to that question. Some pursue spiritual answers, such as meditating or
devoting themselves to charitable causes. Some devote themselves to their children and grandchildren, others
to gardening, painting, or woodworking. The answer for any particular individual is based on that person's

individuation.

321

Individuation is the process by which a person actually becomes an individual, dierentiated from all
other people. It is not to be confused with the ego, or with the conscious psyche, since it includes aspects of
the personal unconscious, as inuenced by the collective unconscious. Jung also described individuation as
the process by which one becomes a whole person. To some extent, this process draws the individual away
from society, toward being just that, an individual. However, keeping in mind the collective unconscious,
Jung believed that individuation leads to more intense and broader collective relationships, rather than
leading to isolation. This is what is meant by a whole person, one who successfully integrates the conscious
psyche, or ego, with the unconscious psyche. Jung also addresses the Eastern approaches, such as meditation,
as being misguided in their attempts to master the unconscious mind. The goal of individuation is wholeness,
wholeness of ego, unconscious psyche, and community (Jung, 1940, 1971):
Consciousness and the unconscious do not make a whole when either is suppressed or damaged by the
other. If they must contend, let it be a fair ght with equal right on both sides. Both are aspects of life. . .It
is the old play of hammer and anvil: the suering iron between them will in the end be shaped into an
unbreakable whole, the individual. (pg. 27; Jung, 1940)

Jimmy Carter was a successful farmer, Governor of Georgia, and President of the United States. As
president he brokered a peace treaty between Egypt and Israel that earned him a Nobel Peace Prize nomination. Despite such an illustrious life to that point, he has, perhaps, done even more good since then. After
devoting himself to a wide variety of social and political activities focusing on peace and justice, including
personally building houses with Habitat for Humanity, the Honorable Mr. Carter received a well-earned
Nobel Peace Prize in 2002.
Discussion Question: Jung identied the rst half of life as a time to take care of the biological needs
of the species (e.g., raising children). It is in the second half of life, according to Jung, that one looks within
oneself for the guidance and motivation to fulll the needs of society and one's culture.

Jungian Analysis
Jung was deeply moved by his ability to help patients, and he took the process of analysis very seriously.
This is not to say, however, that he considered a specic process to be necessary.

He was suspicious of

theoretical assumptions, he focused on each individual in therapy, and was just as likely to adapt Adlerian

techniques as he was to adapt Freudian techniques. In fact, he considered general professional experience to
be an important aspect of one's ability to be a good analyst. He did consider training to be very important,
and that it should include medical training. He was not opposed to lay analysts (those with a Ph.D., rather
than an M.D.), but felt that they should be supervised by a psychiatrist (Jung, 1961).
He built his general system of psychotherapy on four tenets: the psyche is a self-regulating system, the
unconscious has creative and compensatory components, the doctor-patient relationship is crucial, and personality growth takes place throughout the lifespan. In addition, the process of psychotherapy involves four
stages:

confession, elucidation, education, and transformation (see Douglas, 1995). The confession

and elucidation stages involve the patient recounting elements of their personal history, dreams, and fantasies, followed by the analyst bringing attention to symptoms, transferences, and attempting to help the
patient gain insight on both intellectual and emotional levels. The education stage then involves moving the
patient into the realm of an individual, hopefully as an adapted social being. Education focuses mostly on
the persona and the ego, whereas confession and elucidation serve the role of exploring the personal unconscious. The education stage also involves trying to provide the patient with realistic options for changing
their behavior. The nal stage, transformation, was described by Jung as being similar to self-actualization.
Also like self-actualization, not every patient (or person) makes it to this stage. Addressing the archetypal
image of the self, the image of wholeness, requires working with the whole range of the conscious, personal unconscious, and collective unconscious psyches.

The nal goal is to inspire the patient to become

a uniquely individual self without losing a sense of responsible integrity (the collectiveness inherent in the
collective unconscious; see Douglas, 1995).
Since Jung did not want to be tied to any specic technique(s), he incorporated a variety of techniques
as appropriate for each patient.

Like Freud, Jung experimented with hypnosis early in his career, but

discarded the technique as ineective. He used dream analysis regularly, but did not consider each dream
to be necessarily important.
dreams.

Instead, he looked for patterns in dreams over time, particularly recurring

Jung taught his patients to get in touch with their own unconscious psyche through an active

imagination technique.

This meditative imagery procedure is somewhat similar to that of the Buddhist

mindfulness techniques taught by Gotama Buddha some 2,600 years ago, but involves much more active
cognition. Jung's active imagery technique was also extended into actual physical activity. Jung found it
helpful, especially with particularly withdrawn patients, to have them act out their thoughts and feeling.
Jung would even mimic their movements to help himself better understand what his patients were trying
to communicate (Douglas, 1995).

The importance of physical states, as reective of psychological states,

was developed in more detail in the somatic psychology theories of Wilhelm Reich.

In addition, Jung

extended his therapeutic approach to group therapy, family and marital therapy, art therapy, child therapy,
and the recurrent nightmares of patients suering from post-traumatic stress.

Through it all, Jung paid

special attention to complexes, as representative of the psychic processes of the patient. Once an analyst
understands both the symptoms and the complexes of the patient, Jung believed, the analyst has found the
key to treatment (Douglas, 1995).
Like Freud, Jung felt that analytical psychology could serve a greater purpose beyond just helping
individuals, so he turned his attention to society in several of his books.

Soul

(Jung, 1933), Jung addressed the spiritual problems of our times.

In

Modern Man in Search of a

A modern person, according to

Jung, is one who is whole, aware of their conscious psyche and their unconscious psyche (both personal
and collective).

Though such people are few and far between, Jung believed he saw evidence of a need

for understanding the unconscious psyche. One obvious piece of evidence was the rise of psychology as a
discipline at the beginning of the twentieth century.

However, in contrast to Jung's personal preference,

psychology has largely moved away spiritual pursuits, with its preference for a scientic evaluation of the
human mind. Religion, in Jung's opinion, has also moved away from spirituality, in favor of the dogma of
human rules and regulations.

Jung believed that we can learn a great deal from Yoga and Buddhism in

terms of blending psychology and spirituality in order to understand the whole nature of human beings. In

The Undiscovered Self

(Jung, 1957), Jung continues this argument in a more personal way.

He suggests

that modern psychological approaches to self-knowledge are at best supercial, and don't address the real
psychic processes that lead to individuality. As a general condemnation of our obsession with science, he

questions any theory based on statistical averages, since those averages say very little at all about the unique
units being studied, whether they are people or some other object. In

Civilization in Transition (Jung, 1964),

the tenth volume of Jung's collected works, he addresses the problems of American psychology, and what
all Westerners can learn from the ancient wisdom of India about studying our own unconscious psyche. The
importance of understanding the true and complete nature of our psyche is that until we do we cannot live
our lives to the fullest:
Our souls as well as our bodies are composed of individual elements which were all already present in
the ranks of our ancestors. The newness in the individual psyche is an endlessly varied recombination of
age-old components. . .Once the past has been breached, it is usually annihilated, and there is no stopping the
forward motion. But it is precisely the loss of connection with the past, our uprootedness, which has given
rise to the discontents of civilization and to such a urry and haste that we live more in the future and its
chimerical promises of a golden age than in the present, with which our whole evolutionary background has
not yet caught up. (pp. 235-236; Jung, 1961)

A Final Note on Carl Jung
It can be something of a challenge to view Jung's work as psychological. It lends itself more readily to,
perhaps, the study of the humanities, with elements of medieval pseudo-science, Asian culture, and native

Aion: Researches into the Phenomenology
of the Self (Jung, 1959c) and Mysterium Conjunctionis: An Inquiry into the Separation and Synthesis of
Psychic Opposites in Alchemy (Jung, 1970), Jung is not exactly accessible without a wide range of knowledge
religions (an odd combination, to be sure). With titles such as

in areas other than psychology.

Alchemy was of particular interest to Jung, but not in terms of turning

base metals into gold (alchemy is a strange mixture of spirituality and chemistry). Rather, Jung believed
that psychology could nd its base in alchemy, and that it was the collective unconscious that came forth
in the ongoing human eort to understand the nature of matter (Jae, 1979; Jung, 1961; Wehr, 1989). He
even went so far as to write about ying saucers, the astrological seasons of time, and the prophesies of
Nostradamus (Jung, 1959c; Storr, 1983).
And yet, Jung addressed some very important and interesting topics in psychology. His theory of psychological types is reected in trait descriptions of personality and corresponding trait tests, such as Cattell's
16-PF and the MMPI. The value Jung placed on mid-life and beyond, based largely on the ancient Vedic
stages of life, suggests that one is not doomed to the negative alternative in Erikson's nal psychosocial
crises.

So Jung's personal interests, and his career as a whole, straddled the fence between surreal and

practical. He may always be best-known for his personal relationship with Freud, brief as it was, but the
blending of Eastern and Western thought is becoming more common in psychology. So perhaps Jung himself
will become more accessible to the eld of psychology, and we may nd a great deal to be excited about in
his curious approach to psychodynamic theory.

Personality Theory in Real Life: Synchronicity - Coincidence or
an Experience with Mystical Spirituality?
Many people are deeply religious and many others consider themselves to be just as deeply spiritual,
though not connected to any specic religion. As important as religion and spirituality are in the lives of
many people, psychology has tended to avoid these topics, primarily because they do not lend themselves
readily to scientic investigation. Jung certainly did not avoid these topics, and he studied a wide range
of spiritual topics.

For example, he wrote the foreword for Richard Wilhelm's translation of the

he wrote about Gnostic traditions at length (see Segal, 1992), and one of the volumes of his collected works
is entitled

Psychology and Religion: West and East (Jung, 1958).

In addition to his varied spiritual interests,

Jung became interested in psychological phenomena that could not be explained in scientic terms. Such
phenomena do not necessarily require a spiritual explanation, but in the absence of any other way to explain
them, they are often thought of in spiritual terms. One such topic is

synchronicity.

Jung uses the term synchronicity to describe the coincidence in time of two or more causally unrelated
events which have the same or a similar meaning (Jung & Pauli, 1955).

In particular, it refers to the

simultaneous occurrence of a particular psychic state with one or more external events that have a meaningful

parallel to one's current experience or state of mind.

I would like to share with you two experiences of

synchronicity from my own life. Having a Ph.D. in physiological psychology, and having spent a number of
years conducting biomedical research, it seems rather strange to be sharing experiences that can be classied
as extrasensory perception, or ESP. Jung also found it dicult to address this topic:

. . .If

I have now conquered my hesitation and at last come to grips with my theme, it is chiey because

my experiences of the phenomenon of synchronicity have multiplied themselves over the decades. . .As a
psychiatrist and psychotherapist I have often come up against the phenomena in question and could convince
myself how much these inner experiences meant to my patients. In most cases they were things which people
do not talk about for fear of exposing themselves to thoughtless ridicule. I was amazed to see how many
people have had experiences of this kind and how carefully the secret was guarded. So my interest in this
problem has a human as well as a scientic foundation. (pp. 5-6; Jung, in Jung & Pauli, 1955)
Synchronicity Experience #1: In February, 1992, our rst son, Mark David Kelland, Jr., died at birth.
Later that year, I was traveling across the country, taking a whole week to get to a neuroscience convention
in California, and I decided to hike up Wheeler Peak, the highest point in New Mexico (13,161 feet).

I

arrived a little late in the day, but decided I had enough time to make the climb and get back down o the
ridge before dark. I just made it, but still had a few miles to go on the jeep trail down to the parking lot.
Along the way, I stopped and looked back up at Wheeler Peak. I turned o my ashlight, and in the dark
I could just make out the outline of the mountain against the night sky. I prayed to God for a sign that
our son was in Heaven.

The instant I said Amen, a brilliant shooting star streaked across the sky and

descended behind Wheeler Peak! I took it to be the sign I had asked for.
Synchronicity Experience #2: While growing up, we lived next door to Bill and Jackie O'Reilly, who
co-owned the corner drugstore in the center of Foxborough, MA. When I was young I mowed their lawn in
the summer and shoveled their driveway in the winter. When I was old enough to get a regular job, I asked
Mr. O'Reilly for a letter of recommendation for a job at the local newspaper. He declined, saying he wanted
me to work at their drugstore. But he didn't say anything else, until Mrs. O'Reilly told him to give me a
job. So, I worked at the drugstore from the age of 15 to 20 years old. I even began college at the same school
they had attended: the Massachusetts College of Pharmacy. Although I changed schools and switched my
major to psychology, I was always hopeful that the O'Reilly's would be proud of me. Unfortunately, Bill
O'Reilly died a week after I graduated from college. Jackie O'Reilly retired and sold their building, and the
old corner drugstore in the center of town ceased to exist.
Eventually I moved away, pursued my career in psychology, got married and had children, and visits to
Massachusetts became few and far between. One night, about 25 years after I had worked at the drugstore,
I had a very vivid and moving dream. I was standing in the center of Foxborough, looking at the building
where the drugstore had been.

I was overwhelmed by a profound sense of sadness, sad that things must

change with time and cannot remain the same, no matter how much we may long for the past.

I awoke

from that dream astonished by its sense of reality and its emotional impact. The next morning my mother
called me, and told me that Jackie O'Reilly had died during the night! Was it merely a coincidence that I
dreamt about O'Reilly's Pharmacy and felt the sadness of watching time pass away, while Jackie O'Reilly
was in reality passing away, or was it something more? There can be no scientic explanation. I searched
my mind for anything that might have coincidentally caused me to think about the drugstore the day before,
but nothing came to mind except for an alternative explanation, which was not at all scientic. Had Jackie
O'Reilly's spirit passed by and said goodbye, on her way to the great beyond?
In the quote cited above, Jung wrote that he was amazed by how many people have had experiences of
synchronicity. The questions I would pose to you are quite simple. Have you ever experienced synchronicity?
If you have not, do you consider it possible that such events occur as something more than simple (if
improbable) coincidence?
Before dismissing synchronicity as non-scientic, keep in mind the circumstances that led Jung to this
theory. In addition to personally knowing Wolfgang Pauli, Jung also knew Nils Bohr and Albert Einstein
(both of whom, like Pauli, had won a Nobel Prize in physics). Although these men are considered among
the greatest scientists of modern times, Einstein perhaps the greatest, consider some of their theories.
For instance, Einstein proposed that time isn't time, it's relative, except for the speed of light, which

325

alone is always constant. In recent years, experimental physicists have exceeded the speed of light, broken
Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle (which, by denition, couldn't be broken), and proposed that it might
be possible to get something colder than absolute zero. How can we accept things that cannot be observed
or proved as scientic, while rejecting something that Jung and many others have observed time and time
again?

Jung was impressed by the possibility of splitting atoms, and wondered if such a thing might be

possible with the psyche. As physics suggested strange new possibilities, Jung held out the same hope for
humanity (Progo, 1973).
Regardless of whether the strangest of Jung's theories are ever proven right or wrong, at the very least
they provide an opportunity for interesting discussions! There also happens to be another well-known person
in the history of psychology who has experienced synchronicity and who talked about many of her patients
having had out-of-body and near-death experiences: Elisabeth Kubler-Ross. In her book

Death

On Children and

(Kubler-Ross, 1983), Kubler-Ross describes even more serious concerns than Jung about discussing

this topic, but as with Jung, she has also met many, many patients who have had these experiences:

. . .I

have been called every possible name, from Antichrist to Satan himself; I have been labeled, reviled,

and otherwise denounced. . .But it is impossible to ignore the thousands of stories that patients - children and
adults alike - have shared with me. These illuminations cannot be explained in scientic language. Listening
to these experiences and sharing many of them myself, it would seem hypocritical and dishonest to me not
to mention them in my lectures and workshops. So I have shared all of what I have learned from my patients
for the last two decades, and I intend to continue to do so. (pg. 106; Kubler-Ross, 1983)

Discussion Question: Jung studied and wrote about topics as diverse as alchemy, astrology, ying
saucers, ESP, the prophecies of Nostradamus, and synchronicity.

Does this make it dicult for you to

believe any of his theories? If you don't believe anything about any of these topics, are you still able to nd
value in other theories proposed by Jung?

13.1 Review of Key Points
•

As a child, Jung was introduced to a wide variety of cultural and religious perspectives from around
the world. As a result of these experiences, he was open to many dierent perspectives throughout his
career.

•

Jung had extremely vivid dreams, many of which he interpreted as visions (or unconscious communications) intended to guide his actions.

•

Jung called his approach analytical psychology in order to distinguish it from Freud's psychoanalysis
and Adler's individual psychology.

•

An important starting point for Jung's theories was the concept of entropy, which proposes an eventual
balance of all energy. Jung applied this concept to the psychic energy present in the conscious and
unconscious psyches.

•
•
•

Jung proposed two distinct realms within the unconscious psyche, the personal and the collective.
According to Jung, the personal unconscious is revealed through its complexes.
Jung advanced the Word Association Test as a means of examining the complexes contained within
the personal unconscious.

•

The collective unconscious communicates through archetypal images. Jung believed the most readily
observed archetypes are the shadow, the anima, and the animus.

•

Another important archetype is the self, the representation of wholeness and the completed development
of the personality. The self is often symbolically represented by mandalas.

•

Jung developed a framework for recognizing particular personality types. He proposed two attitudes,
introversion and extraversion, and four functions, thinking, feeling, sensing, and intuition.

•

Jung's type theory provided the basis for some practical personality tests.

The Myers-Briggs Type

Indicator and the Keirsey Temperament Sorter are both well-known in the eld of psychology.

•

Jung believed that everyone's ultimate goal is to fully develop the potential of their personality. Jung
called this process individuation.

CHAPTER 13. CARL JUNG

•

Development during the rst half of life involves the natural aims of survival and procreation. The
second half of life oers the opportunity to seek cultural development and the fulllment of one's self.

•

Jungian analysis follows a basic series of stages, involving confession, elucidation, education, and
transformation. However, Jung suggested it was better to avoid being locked into a rigid procedure.
As a result, he utilized many dierent techniques, based on each individual patient.

•

As Freud had before him, Jung developed a grand vision of how analytical psychology might help
society as a whole.

One unique proposition was that the Western world had much to learn from

Eastern cultures.

•

Jung's interest in topics such as alchemy and extrasensory perception did not sit well with colleagues
seeking to establish psychology as a scientic discipline. This opposition to Jung remains quite strong
today, though Western psychology is broadening its perspective.

Yoga and Buddhism as Personality
1

Development Paths

Yoga and Buddhism are vast subjects, spanning many thousands of years, and they are amazing philosophies.
But, are they philosophy or religion?

They both certainly have signicant religious overtones, and are

considered to be religions by many people. Actually, however, they are styles of life that developed in order
to help people be more in tune with their religion and with God. Yoga, which means unity, was a practice
that developed within the Hindu religion to help Hindus achieve unity with God.
practice in one's daily life that led to religious fulllment. The

So it developed as a

Buddha was a Yogi, and did not consider

himself to be dierent than other people. His followers, however, have so fervently held to his teachings that
the practice of Buddhism is often viewed as a religion, and over time it became mixed with religious stories
and myths, as people tried to t Buddhism into their traditional culture.
We will look at Yoga and Buddhism as lifestyles, which lead individuals toward a healthy psychological
development.

We will not be able to avoid the obvious religious and metaphysical overtones, nor should

we try. It will actually be quite interesting to compare Yoga and Buddhism to the lifestyle philosophies of
Judaism, Christianity, and Islam (which cover at least the traditional religions of most American students),
since Judaism, Christianity, and Islam certainly have no shortage of guidelines for living one's daily life in
the service of God. Indeed, Alice Bailey (1927), who has oered an inspiring commentary on the earliest
teachings on Yoga, suggests that in order for students to have a complete picture of the fulllment of the
soul they need to have read three books: the

Yoga Sutras

which will be covered briey in this chapter, and the

and the

New Testament,

Bhagavad Gita,

the philosophy of

covered in the next chapter.

Before beginning this chapter and the next one, however, it should be noted that there are many translations of the classic books on Yoga and Buddhism and terminology varies from translation to translation.
One must simply accept this, since the only alternative is for each one of us to learn all of the languages
in which these books were written. In this chapter, we will only be exploring the basic concepts of these
dierent perspectives on human nature and intentional personality development.
Toward the end of each section we will take a look at how Yoga and Buddhism have inuenced America
and Western psychology. Quite a lot has been written on this topic, including works by some of the most
famous personality theorists (Freud, Jung, Fromm, James, etc.).

However, only recently has there been

sucient interest in the eld of personality for these discussions to start becoming more common.

Since

religion and spirituality are an important aspect of positive psychology, which is itself a rapidly growing
force in psychology, it is likely that knowledge of the overlap between Yoga, Buddhism, and other spiritual
aspects of human nature and personality theory will continue to grow.

CHAPTER 14. YOGA AND BUDDHISM AS PERSONALITY
DEVELOPMENT PATHS

328

14.1 Historical Description of Yoga
Yoga dates back thousands of years. Yoga as we know it today stems primarily from the writings of Patanjali.
Patanjali was one of the rst to write down an ancient oral tradition, in his

Yoga Sutras

(the rules of Yoga),

sometime between 800 B.C. and 300 A.D. (though some claim it is much older). Divided into four short
books, they contain a profound philosophy that continues to have signicant inuence today.

There are

many branches of Yoga now, but the type that was brought to the West, specically to the United States by
Paramahansa Yogananda in the 1920s (Yogananda, 1946), traces its roots directly to the Yoga of Patanjali.

14.2 The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali
An early translation of the

Yoga Sutras

lists 195 sutras in the four books, totaling only sixteen pages

(Bailey, 1927). And yet, the philosophy contained within them is amazing, although somewhat dicult to
understand without having prepared oneself for this very dierent Eastern philosophy. A more Americanized
version of the

Yoga Sutras

has recently been provided by Hartranft (2003), along with a section by section

interpretation of the text.
The rst verse of the rst book states very clearly what Yoga is about. Aum. The following instruction
concerneth the Science of Union. (Yoga

Sutras

I:1; Bailey, 1927). Aum, or

Om, is the sound of creation,

which many Christians may relate to the Word of God in the New Testament (John 1:1; Holy Bible, 1962).
The union refers to the union of the individual with the divine creator. Don't be confused by the fact that
Hindus believe in many gods. In reality, they view those lesser gods as aspects or manifestations of the one
true God, much as Christians believe in one God but refer often to Father, Son, and Holy Spirit (the Holy
Trinity) and the angels and demons (including Satan).
The second and third verses then set the stage for the purpose of practicing Yoga: restraining one's
inquisitive nature and controlling the mind, so that we might see ourselves realistically. The primary way in
which we control the mind is to meditate. The remaining verses describe the nature of man, the universe,
and the divine, the proper practice of Yoga through

meditation, the challenges one is likely to face along the

way, and the marvelous benets of Yoga. Thousands of books, describing many dierent approaches to Yoga,
have followed these simple and straightforward guidelines. No matter which type of Yoga one may choose
to study, it would be valuable for anyone to return to this primary source of information to be reminded of
the basic goal and purpose of Yoga.

14.3 The Bhagavad Gita
The

Bhagavad Gita,

or Song of the Blessed One, is a fascinating story, with great religious signicance

Krishna,
Avatar or divine incarnation, and Arjuna, a great warrior, on the eve of a battle. The battle is

if one accepts it at face value (Mitchell, 2000). It consists primarily of a conversation between
a great

a civil war, with noble warriors and relatives split between both sides.

Arjuna decides that no good can

come of killing so many people in this battle, and he decides not to ght. Krishna, who is driving Arjuna's
chariot, instructs Arjuna in Yoga as he discusses what is right both for Arjuna and for all people. Many of
the principles of Yoga derive from what Krishna told Arjuna, thus it is believed by many that these Yoga
principles come from the mouth of God. This is similar to what Jews, Christians, and Muslims believe about
the Torah, the Bible, and the Koran: that they are divinely inspired texts.
My favorite quote from the

Bhagavad Gita

refers directly to the self:

The Self is a friend for him who masters himself by the Self;
but for him who is not self-mastered, the self is the cruelest foe.
(pg. 89; Mitchell, 2000)
This quote suggests that we can be our own best friend, or our own worst enemy. Indeed, Krishna tells
Arjuna that what he must do is to be himself. It is only through his own actions that Arjuna can fulll his
potential. However, Arjuna must not remain attached to the consequences of his actions; he must simply act

and allow the universe to move forward as it will. Only by truly understanding the nature of the universe,
and the nature of ourselves, can we properly make this choice. The practice of Yoga helps us to see this
reality, and the

Bhagavad Gita

helps to describe the essential practices.

Figure 14.1

The altar prepared for the ceremony when the author was initiated into Kriya Yoga.
Together, the Bhagavad Gita and the Yoga Sutras contain all of the basic information

on Yoga we will

explore in this chapter. There is actually a fair amount of overlap between the books, but it is unclear which
one may have been written rst. Most scholars believe that the

Bhagavad Gita

was written between 500

B.C. and 100 A.D. (Mitchell, 2000), which falls right in the middle of when Patanjali is believed to have
written down the

Yoga Sutras.

Since both philosophies seem to come from much older sources, it may well

be that they owe their commonalities to some older tradition that can no longer be specically identied.

14.3.1 Placing Yoga in Context: An Ancient Plan for Self Development
Yoga is much older than any other theory described in this book, with the exception of those parts of other
theories that were borrowed from Yoga and Buddhism.

The ancient

Vedas, which provide much of the

mythological and philosophical basis for Hinduism, are 4,000 to 5,000 years old (placing them amongst the
oldest recorded literature in the world). The

Yoga Sutras

of Patanjali and the

Bhagavad Gita, which provide

the basic teachings of traditional Yoga, were written as early as 600 B.C. (though there is little consensus on
exactly when). Kriya-Yoga, the yoga believed by many to be the original Yoga of Patanjali, was lost to the
world for many centuries, until it was reintroduced by Lahiri Mahasaya in 1861. Yoga continues to evolve
today, with many dierent styles being introduced and revised, both in the East and the West.
Although this ancient philosophy may not seem relevant to modern personality theory, it has actually
been part of psychology from the very beginning. Most notably, Jung and Rogers were clearly inuenced by
their travels to India and China, respectively. The knowledge of Yoga and Buddhism they developed as a
result of those and other experiences helped to shape their personality theories. Fromm also examined how
psychoanalysis and Buddhist meditation compare to each other.

Today, as positive psychology examines

topics such as happiness and well being, and as spiritual psychotherapists examine the important role that

CHAPTER 14. YOGA AND BUDDHISM AS PERSONALITY
DEVELOPMENT PATHS

spirituality plays in the lives of many people, those practices that Yoga, Buddhism, and other spiritual
disciplines have in common are being examined more closely by psychologists. In the next chapter we will
examine similar spiritual disciplines that exist within the Jewish, Christian, and Muslim traditions.

The Concept of Self from a Yogic Perspective

Spirit, Nature, and Consciousness

In the metaphysics of Yoga there is believed to be a duality between spirit and nature. Spirit is pure
consciousness; nature is the opposite of spirit. Human beings are a combination of spirit and nature. The
body and mind come from nature, but the transcendental self comes from spirit. A key point here is that
it is the

transcendental

self that comes from spirit, not the self we are aware of every day. Our thoughts,

feelings, sensations, indeed our mind itself, are all the result of neural activity in our brain, and our brain is
part of our body. Thus, our awareness is not our consciousness.
Our true self, the transcendental self, is a temporary manifestation of Spirit in essence. The great mistake
in our lives is to confuse our body and mind with who we really are, to believe that this body and this mind
are our self.

The practice of Yoga, however, teaches us to still our minds, to eliminate all thought and

sensation, so that we might be in union with our transcendental self and the universal spirit. Once we have
accomplished this task, by subjugating our natural tendency to think and restraining our mind itself, we will
know who and what we really are (Yoga

Sutras

I:2,3 [Bailey, 1927]). This is not an easy task, but it has a

great reward. As Sri Yukteswar told Yogananda:
The soul expanded into Spirit remains alone in the region of lightless light, darkless dark, thoughtless
thought, intoxicated with its ecstasy of joy in God's dream of cosmic creation (Yogananda, 1946; pgs. 489490).
William James, America's foremost psychologist, is best known for his theory on the stream of consciousness. According to James, it is the continuity of consciousness that denes our self. This is in direct
contradiction to Eastern philosophies, which consider the conscious mind to be derived from the natural
world, and therefore only an illusion. Eastern philosophies consider the transcendental self to be real, but
obscured from us by the distraction of the so-called conscious mind. Can we nd some compromise between
these points of view? No! However, such a contradiction would probably not bother James. James (1892)
did talk about the soul, the transcendental ego, and spirit as possible sources for the conscious self, but
considered that possibility to be outside the realm of psychological study.

Discussion Question:
soul. . .whatever)?

Do you believe in a transcendental self (whether you call it self, spirit,

What does this make you feel about your physical body?

As for all of nature can

you really believe it is just an illusion?

Karma
Karma is a dicult concept to grasp. We generally think of karma as the consequences of things we
have done wrong, but karma does not apply simply to our misbehavior, it applies to all of our actions. An
easy to understand discussion of karma has been written by Goldstein and Korneld (2001).

The law of

karma can be understood on two levels. First, karma refers to cause and eect. Whenever we perform an
action, we experience some consequence at a later time. The second level of karma may be more important,
as it refers to our state of mind at the time when we performed the action in question. Our intentions, or the
motives behind an action, determine the nature of the consequences we experience. The importance of this
point is that we control the nature of our karma. This, of course, has important implications for personality
development. Once we understand the karmic law, it is only natural that we should begin to plant the seeds
of healthy karma. In other words, we should be inclined to act only in ways that are healthy and socially
benecial, so that the consequences we then experience will lead to greater well-being for ourselves.
The second level of karma, that it is our intentions and motivation that aect the outcome of our lives,
seems quite similar to cognitive theories in psychology.

Cognitive psychology focuses on the nature of

our thought, and problems often arise when we are trapped in a series of automatic thoughts that create
problems for us. In other words, when we view the world negatively, we react in negative and maladaptive
ways.

Similarly, our past karma inuences the karma we create for the future.

If we think and act in

negative ways, we create negative karma, but it is also true that if we think and act in positive ways we
create positive karma. Cognitive therapy resembles much of what is written in the East about recognizing

331

the cause-and-eect pattern that our karma traps us within. Successful cognitive therapy is something like
enlightenment: when we realize the truth of what we are doing we have a chance to break that pattern and
move in a healthy direction.

Discussion Question: Karma refers to the cosmic law of cause and eect, the idea that our past actions
will someday aect our current and future lives. Do you believe this, and can you provide any examples of
this happening to you?

The Three Principles of Creation
Would it be possible for us to avoid or circumvent the law of karma by remaining inactive? Sometimes
many of us do just want to get away from everything and everyone. However, social withdrawal is often an
early sign of psychological distress or mental illness, suggesting that this is generally not a healthy action.
According to Yoga, all nature is composed of three aspects called the

Bhagavad Gita,

the three gunas bind to the mortal body the

deathless embodied Self  (pg. 158; Mitchell, 2000). Rajas (born of craving) binds us to action, tamas (born
of ignorance) binds us to dullness, and sattva (untainted and luminous) binds us to knowledge and joy. Only
through faithful Yoga practice can an individual transcend the gunas and achieve unity with God.

Only

then will the individual be free from any attachment to action and free from the law of karma.
Another important and practical question that arises from an understanding of the three gunas is: what
should we eat? In America we generally associate being vegetarian with practicing Yoga or being a Buddhist.
But is there a good reason for this? Everything is made from the three gunas, but in dierent proportions.
So we might say that a hot, spicy dish like Gang Garee from Thailand (a personal favorite) is predominantly
rajas. Heavy food, with a thick sauce or gravy is predominantly tamas. Fruits and vegetables, however, are
lighter and more refreshing; they are predominantly sattva. So a vegetarian diet should increase the relative
amount of sattva in our body, thus making us a better person. This is just like the old saying: You are what
you eat! This goes beyond diet, however, since diet only directly aects the body. What about the mind?
Everything we take in is comprised of the three gunas: words and ideas that we hear, music, the emotions
expressed by people we spend time with, and so on (Vivekananda, 1955a). It is important not only that we
eat well, but also that we spend time in relaxing and healthy environments, associate with good people, and
generally try to cultivate a life that moves more toward sattva than the other gunas.

The Guru or Teacher
Spirit vs. nature, consciousness, karma, the three gunas, it can all seem very strange to those of us who
did not grow up with these concepts. Another common source of confusion is the distinction between the
terms

yogi and guru. A yogi is anyone who practices Yoga. A guru is a teacher, someone advanced in Yoga

and capable of leading others on the path. A true guru is typically revered in the East, and in English they
are often referred to as prophets, or saints.
Many believe that a guru is essential to the practice of Yoga. The practice of Yoga can be dicult, and
the principles can be confusing. Some argue that only through initiation by a guru can an individual truly
and correctly use

mantras such as Om. Otherwise, the would-be student of Yoga will not know the correct

frequency or nature of the mantra. Perhaps most important, though, is the spiritual consciousness provided
by the guru. As described by Yogananda:

. . .If I entered the hermitage in a worried or indierent frame of mind, my attitude imperceptibly changed.
A healing calm descended at the mere sight of my guru. Each day with him was a new experience in joy,
peace, and wisdom. Never did I nd him deluded or emotionally intoxicated with greed, anger, or human
attachment. (pg. 137; Yogananda, 1946)
Another aspect involved in the importance of a guru is his or her lineage. In Western culture we are very
individualistic, so it is common for each new teacher or leader to try establishing a new beginning. In the
collectivist cultures of the East, however, they pay more attention to the earlier teachers of current teachers.
Establishing this lineage is very important, not to suggest that one line of Yoga is better than another, but
to connect the past to the present and, presumably, the present to the future. Recent research in the eld
of positive psychology has suggested that such a balanced time perspective, emphasizing the past, present,
and future, is an important facet of psychological well-being (Boniwell, 2005; Boniwell & Zimbardo, 2003).

about mentors. Do the words guru and mentor mean the same thing to you? Have you ever been inspired
by someone you thought of as a guru or mentor?

14.4 Pathways to Personal Growth: Schools of Yoga
There are many schools of Yoga, and the styles depend somewhat on which translations and which authors
you happen to read. In her discourse accompanying the translation of Patanjali's

Yoga Sutras,

Bailey refers

HathaYoga, Laya-Yoga, Bhakti-Yoga, and Raja-Yoga (also known as Kriya-Yoga, see Yogananda [1946]).
to four types of Yoga that developed as humanity developed (1927). In chronological order they are

Feuerstein (2003) adds three more to what he describes as the seven major branches of the tree of Hindu
Yoga:

Jnana-Yoga, Karma-Yoga, and Mantra-Yoga.

The purpose of each of these schools of Yoga, in their own way, is to guide the individual toward the
fulllment of their life. This fulllment is not necessarily

enlightenment, or what we in the West may think

of as heaven, but may instead be preparation for steadily improving lives over subsequent reincarnations. In
accordance with the concept of karma, if we do our best to live this life as a good and faithful person, then
in our future lives we will benet from the seeds of good karma we have planted in this life. As humans we
can achieve enlightenment in this life, but we are not doomed to eternal damnation if we don't quite make
it. So, Yoga oers us a hopeful guide toward being a good person, and teaches ways in which to continue
our personal growth.

Hatha-Yoga
Hatha-Yoga is the Yoga of power, referring primarily to the

Kundalini energy and prana (vital en-

ergy) within the body. The practices of Hatha-Yoga are intended to strengthen and prepare the body for
controlling the life forces within.

An important aspect is the practice of

often misidentied as being Hatha-Yoga itself.

asanas, the postures that are

However, traditional Hatha-Yoga also involves celibacy, a

vegetarian diet, breathing and concentration exercises (meditation), and cleansing the nasal passages and
the alimentary canal.

Laya-Yoga
Laya-Yoga focuses on meditative absorption of the psyche or mind to the point of ecstatic realization,
or

samadhi. As an advancement from Hatha-Yoga, Laya-Yoga leaves behind the physical focus of Hatha-

Yoga for a highly developed state of meditation in which one's sense of self dissolves into transcendental
self-realization (i.e., realization of the true self, the transcendental spirit).

Bhakti-Yoga
Bhakti-Yoga is the Yoga of devotion or love, in which the force of human emotion is channeled toward
the Divine. This devotion develops along nine stages, the rst being to listen to the names of God. The
second is to chant praises in honor of the Lord, which is why chanting is so common in the practice of Yoga
and Buddhism. The remaining stages involve a variety of practices or rituals. As simple as the rst two
stages may seem, together they have given rise to a special form of musical prayer:

Kirtan, the practice of

singing the many names of God (see the section on spiritual music below).
Bakti-Yoga is more than just a simple devotion to

atman (the Supreme Soul that is God). It is a deep,

genuine searching for the Lord that begins, continues, and ends in love (Vivekananda, 1955a). The secret of
Bhakti-Yoga is that the great sages of ancient India realized that passionate human emotions are not wrong
in themselves, they are not to be avoided and repressed, but rather they should be carefully harnessed and
turned toward a higher spiritual direction. This is the direction of God, and the true nature of Bhakti-Yoga.
However, there can also be dark side to Bhakti-Yoga, among those who have not turned toward a higher
direction. Individuals who become trapped in the lowest level of Bhakti-Yoga can become religious fanatics.
The only way they see to truly love one ideal is to hate all others (Vivekananda, 1955a). Religious fanaticism
has caused great torment throughout the history of the human race, but it should never be confused with
the true ideals of religion or spirituality.

Raja-Yoga or Kriya-Yoga
Raja-Yoga, or Royal Yoga, combines the principles, though not necessarily the practices, of other forms
of Yoga and thus supersedes them all (Bailey, 1927).

Raja-Yoga is that which was originally taught by

Patanjali in the

Yoga Sutras.

It is also known by the name Kriya-Yoga, and it is this term that Yogananda

used when bringing Yoga to the United States in 1920. According to Yogananda, this form of Yoga is more
than just a practice developed by a great man. Patanjali is believed to be one of the ancient avatars of India,
making this form of Yoga a direct divine inspiration (Yogananda, 1946). Furthermore, this form of Yoga
was lost to humanity for centuries, until another avatar named Babaji revealed it again to the Indian guru
named Lahiri Mahasaya in 1861 (Yogananda, 1946). Of particular interest to Americans may be the fact
that Babaji inspired Yogananda to come to America, through Babaji's disciples Lahiri Mahasaya and Sri
Yukteswar. Thus, Yoga came to the United States, as well as the rest of the Western world, at the behest
of Babaji, a divine incarnation believed by many to be as signicant as Gotama Buddha or Jesus Christ!

Jnana-Yoga
Jnana-Yoga is the Yoga of wisdom or knowledge. It is a rigorous discipline in which one uses the intellect
to discern reality from

maya. Maya is often misunderstood, and described as the cosmic delusion that our

Self is this body in this life.

However, Swami Vivekananda has oered an excellent explanation of what

maya really is: simply a matter of fact statement about the nature of the world and of man (Vivekananda,
1955b). The philosophy from which our understanding of maya comes is neither optimistic nor pessimistic,
but it does challenge our basic understanding of everything we believe is real. There is no good without evil,
no happiness without misery, no beauty without ugliness. Consequently, there will never be a perfect world,
a world in which there is no suering or death. Even the basic existence of the world must be considered
in the context of no-existence. This strange and challenging philosophy is described by Vivekananda in the
following passage:
What, then, does the statement that the world exists mean?

It really means that the world has no

existence. What, again, does the statement that the world has no existence mean? It means that it has no
absolute existence: it exists only in relation to my mind, to your mind, and to the mind of everyone else.
We see this world with the ve senses, but if we had another sense, we would see in it something more. If
we had yet another sense, it would appear as something still dierent. It has, therefore, no real existence; it
has no unchangeable, immovable, innite existence. Nor can it be said to have non-existence, since it exists
and we have to work in and through it. It is a mixture of existence and non-existence. (pg. 27-28).
As you can see from this passage, Jnana-Yoga requires not only a keen intellect, but an open-minded
willingness to embrace a dierent perspective. This perspective had a strong inuence on the development
of Chinese religion and philosophy, and similar concepts can be found in the famous

Tao Te Ching

of Lao

Tsu, which provides the basis for Taoism (Lao Tsu, c. 600 B.C.).
The question of whether or not we recognize the reality of our world is central to cognitive psychology.
In cognitive therapy, it is taken for granted that an individual does not view their environment realistically,
that automatic thoughts of a maladaptive nature turn each situation into another instance of the person's
typical problem. With the help of an objective therapist, the individual may come to realize the nature of
their maladaptive thought processes, and learn to control and re-evaluate their thoughts and feelings, so that
they can react appropriately to other people and to new situations. In a similar way, the principles of Yoga,
under the guidance of a guru, can help us to understand our world and the role we play in determining our
future (creating good or bad karma).

Karma-Yoga
Because we are inseparably compelled by the gunas (the three aspects of existence), existence involves
action. Karma-Yoga teaches us to act without attachment to the consequences of our actions and without
any expectations. But it is not enough to control our actions, we must understand why we are controlling
our mind. As Krishna tells Arjuna in the third chapter of the

Bhagavad Gita:

He who controls his actions, but lets his mind dwell on sense-objects, is deluding himself and spoiling his
search for the deepest truth. The superior man is he whose mind can control his senses; with no attachment
to results, he engages in the yoga of action (pgs. 62-63).
The practical values of Karma-Yoga are many. According to Vivekananda (1955a), the true character
of a person can be seen by watching their actions. Those who work for work's sake, just because good will
come of it, and who have given up any sense of self or attachment to their works, has achieved the ideal
of Karma-Yoga. As dicult as it may be to take control of one's life, in other words to direct one's own

karma, it can be done. If we learn to look at our past and present bad circumstances simply as facts that
have happened, it is really our own opinion that allows those circumstances to aect our self-image (Schied,
1986).

If we can look past those negative circumstances, indeed even look for the positive aspects in all

situations, we can begin to act in positive ways that will create good karma for our future.

To let go?  Korneld, 1994
Mantra-Yoga
Mantra-Yoga is the Yoga of sound or vibration.

The universe is believed to be in constant vibration.

Om, the most sacred mantra, is believed to be the word representing the fundamental vibration of the
universe. As such, meditating while chanting Om is believed to have almost magical transformative powers
over the body and mind (Feuerstein, 2003). It is also common to chant short prayer phrases, such as Om
Namah Shivaya (I bow to Shiva), the Hare Krishna mantra (the mahamantra, or great mantra), and Om
Mani Padme Hum (a Tibetan Buddhist chant that has no direct translation). The CD

Pilgrim Heart,

by

Krishna Das (2002), oers both insightful description and a modern musical presentation of some of these
chants.

Connections Across Cultures: Franchised Yoga Centers in America
If you take a look at the magazine section of a major bookstore, you will nd several magazines devoted
to the practice of Yoga.

In those magazines, you can nd dozens of Yoga training centers and retreats.

Many colleges and universities in America oer courses in Yoga. Yoga is very much a part of life for many
Americans. But has it made its way into the mainstream? There is some interesting evidence to suggest
that if it hasn't yet, it will very soon. The days when Yoga centers were only individual operations, run by
a small group of devoted yogis, appear to be over.
In 2003, internet entrepreneurs George Lichter and Rob Wrubel (formerly with the search engine Ask
Jeeves International) were looking to move into a new business venture. When the two men realized that
both were practicing Yoga (primarily the physical aspects of Hatha-Yoga), they decided to create a chain of
Yoga centers across America. Beginning with the purchase of an established yoga center in Los Angeles, they
have plans to expand to a variety of major cities, and ultimately to smaller locations around the country.
Although a business model may t well with American capitalism, can such an approach t with Yoga? They
hope that by having the company focus on the business aspects of running a Yoga studio, the instructors
can be freed to focus on teaching Yoga to their students.
Many Americans still view Yoga as an odd curiosity and, primarily, as a form of exercise. Before I rst
began going to a Yoga retreat center I wondered if it would be too strange for me (even though I knew
someone who had been going there for years). I had a wonderful time, and have returned there many times.
But, like so many others, it is a retreat center all by itself. As Yoga centers based on the model of chain
stores, with some consistency in terms of the services and environment they oer, spread across America, I
think more people will take a chance on beginning to examine this curious path toward relaxation and peace
of mind.

14.5 Obstacles to Personal Growth: Patanjali's Five Hindrances
Patanjali's ve hindrances refer to conditions that block our personal development.
identied as:

The hindrances are

avidya (ignorance), sense of personality, desire, hate, and sense of attachment. It may seem

confusing to us that a sense of personality is a hindrance to personal development. Isn't the goal in life to
become aware of and comfortable with our true selves? Unfortunately, from the perspective of Yoga, that
belief is the result of the single most challenging hindrance, the one that is the source of all other diculties:
ignorance. The problem, according to Patanjali, is that our sense of personality is a mistaken identication
of our mental awareness, a product of our brain (nature), with our true and transcendental self (spirit).
Specically, the fth Sutra of Book II states that avidya is the condition of confusing the permanent, pure,
blissful and the Self with that which is impermanent, impure, painful and the not-Self  (Bailey, 1927; pg.
115). The latter point refers specically to the duality between our true self, that temporary manifestation

335

of spirit in nature, with the body/mind of this world that will cease to exist when we die (though death does
not really exist in the same sense in the perspective of Yoga).
It is also something of a problem to use the term attachment in a negative way. In Western psychology
attachment is typically used to refer to the bonding between parent and child. Thus, we consider attachment
to be a necessary condition of healthy development. In Yoga, however, any form of attachment is a delusion in
which we consider elements of the natural world to be of importance. Only the universal spirit is perspective,
even the love of a parent for a child is a delusion that keeps us attached to this world, and would therefore
be a hindrance to our union with God. Actually, things are not as bleak as that might make them seem at
rst. Since there is only one universal spirit, we and our children, indeed everyone everywhere, is one and
the same universal spirit, both past and present (hence the meaninglessness of death). So it is not wrong
to love, it is only a mistake to think that love for a person or love for a thing is the most important thing
in life. What is important is to practice Yoga in order to overcome these hindrances, to escape the laws of
karma, to quiet the mind and transcend the natural world. Then one will know their union with God and
all creation.

Discussion Question: According to Patanjali, the single greatest obstacle to personal growth is avidya
(ignorance). How has your education helped you to grow as a person? Have you taken any courses specically
designed to help you with personal development?

What plans, if any, do you have for continuing your

education after you nish school?

Classic Indian Stages of Life
According to the Vedic teaching of ancient India, each Hindu male should progress through four stages of
life: student, householder, hermit or forest-dweller, and nally renunciant. At a young age the child would
be sent to live with a guru, so that he might devote himself to spiritual development, studying the

Vedas

(ancient Indian texts that provide much of the philosophy, practices, rituals and other guides for Hindu life),
and mastering Yoga. Then the young man returns home, takes a wife (usually an arranged marriage), runs
the family business, and basically takes care of the business of maintaining the Indian society. As the man
grows older, and his children become ready to take over as the householders, he becomes a hermit, once again
devoting himself to Yoga. Finally, the old man leaves society completely behind and focuses himself entirely
on unity with God.

For Hindu females all that can be said is that, unfortunately, this philosophy comes

from an old and patriarchal society. There are no classic stages of life for women in the Vedic teachings.
These four stages are an ideal of the traditional Hindu life. As in our own culture, both personal and
family values change over time. Many Hindus do not follow these ancient ways. Though this style of life is
certainly not necessary for the practice of Yoga, one can see the advantage of beginning and ending one's
life with the sole purpose of practicing and mastering Yoga. Another interesting issue raised by these stages
of life is the importance of middle age. In America we often hear about the so-called midlife crisis. There is
some debate as to whether the midlife crisis exists, and whether it exists for both men and women, but in
traditional Indian culture there is a profound dierence: middle age is not the beginning of a decline toward
old age and death, but rather a time to focus on the future and one's enlightenment. Therefore, middle age
should be a particularly hopeful and peaceful time.

14.6 Yoga in America: The Self-Realization Fellowship and Transcendental Meditation
Although many dierent gurus have come to America, teaching many dierent types of Yoga, perhaps the two
most inuential have been Paramahansa Yogananda and Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Yogananda established
the Self-Realization Fellowship (SRF) in 1920 (Yogananda, 1946). Yogananda was one of the rst gurus to
come to America, and the SRF may be the oldest continuing school of Yoga in the West. Headquartered
in California, SRF is dedicated to combining the Yoga of old with the predominant religion of the new
world: Christianity.

One of Yogananda's most important works is

us life, and when we realize that He is within our selves (thus, the name Self-Realization) we cannot help but
lead a better life. As strange as this may seem to many Christians, blending religious and philosophical beliefs
is commonly accepted in Eastern cultures. They seek the best points of view in a variety of perspectives,
and try to live according to those beliefs that are common and which benet everyone in their community.
More information on the SRF can be found on their website (listed at the end of the chapter).
In 1958, a guru named Maharishi Mahesh Yogi began formally teaching

Transcendental Meditation

(TM; Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, 1963). TM became a very popular meditation technique in America, and as
many as 6 million people around the world have learned the TM technique (this website is also listed at the
end of the chapter). Yogi's rst book on TM was originally entitled

Living,

The Science of Being and the Art of

and he stated very clearly the purpose of life: Expansion of happiness is the purpose of life. . . (pg.

64) and When one does not live a normal life or a life using his full potential, he feels miserable and tense
and suers in many ways (pg. 69). This reference to the necessity of using one's full potential sounds very
similar to Roger's and Maslow's concept of self-actualization (or perhaps self-realization as described in the
preceding paragraph). As is true of the SRF, the TM program does not advocate or reject any organized
religion. Instead, TM is presented as a means to fulll one's life, regardless of the situation in which one is
living.

Connections with Western Religious Practice

Contemplative Prayer

Consider the following quote: Listen carefully, my son, to the master's instructions, and attend to them
with the ear of your heart.

This is advice from a father who loves you; welcome it, and faithfully put it

into practice. The labor of obedience will bring you back to him from whom you had drifted through the
sloth of disobedience. This message of mine is for you, then, if you are ready to give up your own will. . .
This sounds like the words of a guru, especially the part about giving up your own will. Doesn't that sound
like the Yoga philosophy of transcending the mind in order to be in union with the spirit? Actually, this
was written by St. Benedict, a Catholic monk who lived from 480-547 (Fry, 1982). In fact, this is the very
beginning of the Rule of St. Benedict, and it is interesting to note that the very rst word is Listen. . .
Remember the rst stage of devotion in Bhakti-Yoga? It is not easy to listen, and listening intently with
our whole being is something that takes a lifetime to master (deWaal, 1984). Naturally, it is easier to listen
when we are focused, and either the practice of Yoga or contemplative prayer can help to still our mind, to
tune out the distractions of our daily lives, so that we can listen to and/or be in union with God.
During the twentieth century, a Benedictine monk named John Main (1926-1982) tried to help the
Christian world rediscover meditation and contemplative prayer. In addition to his own eorts, he inspired
the creation of the

World Community for Christian Meditation,

an international community that practices

and teaches meditation in the Christian tradition (see the website list at the end of the chapter). As is true
of many practitioners of meditation, Fr. Main recommended meditating twice a day, once in the morning
and once in the evening. A marvelous collection of Fr. Main's writings has been compiled by Paul Harris
(2003).

The readings are quite short, and there is one for each day of the year.

They can be used as a

starting point for contemplation and prayer on the day assigned for each reading (if one chooses to follow
that pattern). We will cover Christian mysticism, meditation, and contemplative prayer in more detail in
the next chapter.

Spiritual Music
Another interesting comparison between Eastern and Western spiritualism is the use of music and song.
The importance of chanting was mentioned above, but now we will take a closer look at the importance of
music. The Yoga of Patanjali focuses on withdrawing from all sensory experience. The goal of meditation is
to focus and then clear the mind, so that one is no longer distracted by the events of this world. However,
in Bhakti-Yoga, the Yoga of devotion, some yogis embrace the fullness of rened human emotion (Mandala
Publishing Group, 2000).
all that is around us.

Music is one of the best ways to fully express our emotional connection with

A special type of musical prayer called Kirtan grew out of the rst two stages of

Bhakti-Yoga. Kirtan refers to the practice of singing the many names of God (including Goddess names). In
the practice of Kirtan, the words that are sung are typically short mantras, and a wide variety of emotional
states can be accommodated. Regardless of how one feels when beginning Kirtan, the practice of Kirtan can

lead to a transformational, meditative state that creates a safe, calm haven for the ower of the heart to
unfold (Jai Uttal, 2003). A wonderful CD of Kirtan, including an explanation of this practice in English,
has been recorded by Jai Uttal (2003). If you would like to learn more about Kirtan, especially if you are
interested in reducing stress in your life, this CD is highly recommended.
Although most Christian church services include some music, few are thought of as profoundly inspirational and emotionally moving as the gospel choirs associated with Black churches, especially those in the
Southern United States. Much of this music is rooted in the

spirituals sung by American slaves. Much

like Kirtan as a practice within Yoga, the spirituals helped to hold onto an identity shared by Africans
brought to America as slaves. The music was not strictly religious, but religious themes were common. More
importantly, the spirituals helped to connect the slaves to their African ancestry, and to provide a context
within which they could share the lives they had come to know in a new country (Cone, 1972; Lovell, Jr.,
1972). As slavery came to an end in the United States, prejudice and discrimination certainly did not. On
one hand the spirituals gave rise to the blues, but on the other hand they gave rise to distinctly religious
gospel music (Boyer and Yearwood, 1995; Broughton, 1985).

Gospel music can be so passionate that it

has been described as hinting at a vocal imperative which was said to induce religious convulsions in their
audiences. . . (Broughton, 1985). Perhaps it should not be surprising that Black gospel music is so deeply
emotional, since it arose from a group of people who had been slaves, and were still suering from rampant
discrimination in a country that claimed to hold freedom above all else. Although such raw emotion is not
common to Kirtan, it is still deeply passionate for those who feel its intimate connection to the universal
spirit.

Discussion Question: Using music during prayer or religious services has a long and rich history.
Many of our social gatherings are centered on music.

How has music inuence your life?

Do you listen

to inspirational music when you feel a need to clear your mind and relax, or do you listen to lively and
entertaining music to enhance the enjoyment of being with family and/or friends?

Indeed, Siddhattha

Gotama had lived many lives before he was born into that earthly identity (if, of course, you believe in such
things), and this had an important impact on his life.

According to legend, Dipankara Buddha foretold

that Siddhattha Gotama would be born as a prince in the kingdom of the Shakyas (so he is also referred to
as Prince Shakyamuni and as Shakyamuni Buddha), and that in that lifetime he would become a Buddha.
Sometime around the fth or sixth century B.C., Prince Shakyamuni was born. Not wanting his son to leave
the kingdom, the king indulged his son with every sensual pleasure known to man. The king also protected
his son from knowing the unpleasant realities of life (disease, death, etc.).

However, the prince's destiny

was set. Prince Shakyamuni decided he wanted to see the kingdom. In order to prevent the prince from
seeing the reality of life, the king ordered that everything in the city should be cleaned and decorated and
everyone should be on their best behavior. However, four heavenly beings appeared to Prince Shakyamuni:
the rst as someone suering the ravages of old age, the second as someone stricken with disease, the third
as a corpse, and the fourth as a wandering monk. These visitors made a profound impression on the young
prince, who left his wife, child, and home to seek enlightenment.
Living in India, the path to spiritual enlightenment that he followed was to become a yogi. He studied
meditation, he became an accomplished ascetic (it is said he lived for a time on one grain of rice a day),
but he failed to achieve anything satisfying.

So nally he had a nice lunch and sat down under a Bodhi

tree, vowing to remain seated until he achieved enlightenment.

readily available (e.g., see Byrom, 1993). In his own words, we can see the relationship between Buddhism
and psychology, and how these teachings were meant to guide people toward a healthy and happy life. In
the teaching entitled Choices, the Buddha says:
We are what we think.
All that we are arises with our thoughts.
With our thoughts we make the world.
Speak or act with a pure mind
And happiness will follow you
As your shadow, unshakable. (pgs. 1-2)

Bodhidharma
Bodhidharma (c. 440-528) is recognized as the monk responsible for bringing
into China.

Zen Buddhism from India

He was also present during the construction of the Shaolin Temple, and was one of the rst

monks there. During his time at Shaolin Temple he is most famous for spending nine years in meditation,
staring at the wall of a cave.

He is also credited with developing kung-fu, the well-known martial arts

technique, so that the temple monks could protect themselves from bandits. Although Bodhidharma may
have spent a great deal of time in meditation, his Zen teaching was based more on a sword of wisdom (Red
Pine, 1987). Some of the strange practices in Zen that we will examine in this chapter can be described as
almost surprising people into enlightenment. Of course, many years of practice and discipline are necessary
in order to be ready for this enlightenment. Some of Bodhidharma's writings are still available to us today
(e.g., Red Pine, 1987), and in his own words (translated, of course) we can get a glimpse of just how strange
a Zen understanding of the truth can be:
If you use your mind to study reality, you won't understand either your mind or reality. If you study
reality without using your mind, you'll understand both. Those who don't understand, don't understand
understanding. And those who understand, understand not understanding. People capable of true vision
know that the mind is empty. They transcend both understanding and not understanding. The absence of
both understanding and not understanding is true understanding. (pg. 55)

His Holiness the Dalai Lama
Unlike the historical gures Gotama Buddha and Bodhidharma, the Dalai Lama is alive today. Although
his home is Tibet, where he was born in 1935, he lives in exile in India.

He is believed to be the 14

th

Dalai Lama, a reincarnation of the previous Dalai Lamas, the rst of whom is believed to have been the
reincarnation of a boy who lived during the time of Gotama Buddha.

That boy was an incarnation of

Chenrezig (also known as Avalokiteshvara), the Bodhisattva of Compassion (a Bodhisattva is like a Buddha
 see below), and the Dalai Lamas have served for over 650 years as the religious leader of the Tibetan
people. Due to political circumstances in Tibet today, it is unclear what may happen to Tibetan culture.
The Dalai Lama himself does not know whether he will be the last of the Dalai Lamas, but he hopes that
choice will someday be made by a free and democratic Tibetan society (Dalai Lama, 2002).

Placing Buddhism in Context: The First Psychology?
Both Buddhism and Yoga share roots in ancient traditions among the Vedic people. Siddhattha Gotama
was a yogi seeking enlightenment, and it was his followers who established Buddhism as the practice of his
new path: the Middle Way. Since most people think of Buddhism and Yoga as separate, it makes things
easier to treat them separately.
Buddhism is as old as the Yoga of Patanjali, perhaps even older, and like Yoga had a profound inuence
on some well-known personality theorists (such as Rogers and Fromm). Since Yoga is usually thought of as a
form of exercise in America, because of the popularity of Hatha Yoga, when people think of meditation they
often think rst of Buddhism. Zen Buddhism emphasizes meditation, and Zen has been the most popular
and best-known form of Buddhism in America, largely due to the arrival of D. T. Suzuki in 1897.
There are two major schools of Buddhism in the world today. The Theravada tradition is most popular in
southeast Asia. It emphasizes self-discipline and seeking nirvana. The Mahayana tradition is most popular in
China, Tibet, Korea, and Japan. The Mahayana tradition emphasizes compassion, and is the school within
which Zen developed.

Tibetan Buddhism, which also developed within the Mahayana tradition, enjoys

something of a celebrity status due to the renown of the Dalai Lama, who is recognized as the spiritual

leader of the Tibetan people.
In many ways one can nd connections between Buddhism and psychology today.

As an interesting

example, the well-known author and spiritual leader Jack Korneld became a Thai Buddhist monk before
returning to the United States and becoming a clinical psychologist. Many of the books comparing Eastern
philosophy to Western psychology have focused on Zen Buddhism. Zen emphasizes meditation, which in one
form or another has become a common element of many types of psychotherapy, particularly in humanistic
and cognitive approaches. Since Buddhism shares the same tradition as Yoga, it would make no sense to
say that Buddhism has inuenced psychology more than Yoga. They are fundamentally the same, and their
inuence continues to grow.

14.8 The Four Noble Truths of Human Life
Following his enlightenment, the Buddha began to teach what he had realized. In his rst lesson, he described
the Four Noble Truths: 1) suering is an unavoidable reality in human life; 2) the source of suering is craving
or desire, and the bad karma it creates; 3) the craving that leads to suering can be destroyed; 4) the Middle
Way is the path to eliminate craving and suering (Suzuki, 1960; World's Great Religions, 1957; Wilkins,
1967). People often ask why there is so much suering in the world. When this question is asked, there is
usually an unspoken desire to remove this suering from the world. The Buddha, however, taught us that
we cannot escape from reality. Who has never been sick? Who never dies? Who can live without desiring
something? The problem is that when our cravings are satised, we typically nd that we want something
else, or something more, we never seem to be really satised.

And so this cycle of craving, temporary

satisfaction, craving again, and so on, continues throughout our life, unless we consciously do something to
break the pattern. The Buddha taught us how to do that: by following the Middle Way.
The Middle Way is also known as the Eightfold Path, because there are eight aspects to it: 1) right
knowledge, 2) right intention, 3) right speech, 4) right conduct, 5) right livelihood, 6) right eort, 7) right
mindfulness, and 8) right concentration. Some believe that each step depends on what goes before it, so
that in order to reach higher levels of this discipline one must accomplish the lower levels (Wilkins, 1967).
A hierarchical series of steps like this is reminiscent of Maslow's hierarchy of needs.

In Buddhism, we

must begin with an understanding of how things really are, an understanding of the four noble truths,
impermanence, and

interbeing (right knowledge). We must then develop the right intentions, to want to

be compassionate, selessly detached, loving, and non-violent. Once we have developed a conducive state of
mind, we can choose to refrain from lying, gossiping, swearing, and other misuse of language (right speech).
We can avoid doing things that are immoral, irresponsible, cruel, or illegal (right conduct), and we would
not choose a career which required us to do any such things (right livelihood). Then we would be able to
focus our will on avoiding any unhealthy states of mind, and on eliminating them quickly should they arise
(right eort).

Finally we could become more aware of our sensations, feelings, minds, and bodies (right

mindfulness), so that we might focus on the discipline necessary to continue our practice of the Middle Way
(right concentration).
These principles provide the basis for a practical code of conduct, which all Buddhists must follow,
known as the

Five Precepts. They are: 1) to abstain from killing, 2) to abstain from stealing, 3) to abstain

from sexual misconduct, 4) to abstain from lying, and 5) to abstain from mind-altering intoxicants (World's
Great Religions, 1957). The rst four seem to follow naturally from the Eightfold Path, but the last one is
somewhat more interesting. The problem with intoxicating drugs, such as alcohol, is that they cloud the
mind. They make it dicult for us to make responsible choices, which is what the Middle Way is all about.
Also, if you think back to our discussion of karma, the intentions behind your actions are as important, if
not more important, than the actions themselves. When you have made a choice to use intoxicating drugs,
and then violate any of the other precepts, it is the consequence of your earlier choice. And who needs bad
karma on top of bad karma?

Calm and compassion are so precious. Make sure not to
lose them through intoxication.  Korneld, 1994

Impermanence
The Buddha said that everything arises and passes away. . .existence is illusion (in Byrom, 1993). The
idea that nothing is permanent is a central belief in Buddhism. People are born, grow up, grow old, and die.
Buildings wear down, cars break down, and enormous trees wither away.

Even mountains are eventually

worn down by erosion. However, children are born, new cars and buildings are built, new plants grow, and
life goes on. The implications for Buddhism are quite interesting. If everything, and everyone, changes, then
even someone who is enlightened will change!

One cannot

be

a Buddha, for they will change.

We must

always continue to grow. Likewise, Buddhism itself will change, so most of their doctrines are not seen as
static. They anticipate change over time.
For psychology, this has both good and not so good implications. For people who are depressed or anxious,
they might take heart in impermanence, since things should eventually get better. Indeed, studies on the
eects of psychotherapy often show that some people get better over time without treatment. However, if
things seem to be going great, if you are happy and having lots of fun, those things will change too. But
knowing this, we can prepare ourselves for it. An important aspect of coping with life's challenges is a sense
of being in control. Although there are a wide variety of variables that contribute to individual resilience,
maintaining a positive state of mind can help, and knowledge can help to maintain that positive state of
mind (Bonnano, 2004, 2005; Folkman and Moskowitz, 2000; Ray, 2004).
If we practice

mindfulness and meditation, we can begin to see the impermanence of our lives. As

we let go of our attachments to our self-image, our life will ow by like the pictures of a movie, each one
a separate image, which only appears to ow smoothly when viewed at high speed. As we observe these
eeting images, we see how our sensations, thoughts, feelings, every aspect of our lives, change so quickly.
We might then embrace the change that is truly our life. This process of letting go can be very dicult, but
also very liberating (Goldstein and Korneld, 2001).

Do not seek perfection in a changing world.
Instead, perfect your love.  Korneld, 1994
Suering
As we learned with the rst of the Four Noble Truths, suering is an integral part of the human experience.
It is easy for us to think of suering in terms of big pictures: war, famine, natural disasters, and the like.
But how often do we think of suering as an inherent part of our daily lives? Life is dicult, it is a struggle,
especially the way most of us live it. A struggle can only lead to suering. The ultimate outcome of life's
struggle, should we lose the battle, is death.

If we could defeat death we would end up alone, and that

loneliness might be even worse than the original suering itself (Suzuki, 1962). Still, we do not even need to
look at suering in terms of a lifetime battle against aging and death, we can see suering in every moment
of the day. Goldstein and Korneld oer a marvelous description of the daily challenge to be satised (2001).
It goes something like this. Suppose we woke up on a day when we had no obligations at all. It might be
tempting to stay in bed all day, but eventually we become uncomfortable because we have to go to the
bathroom. Finally we go, and then crawl back into bed to get warm. But then we get hungry, so nally we
get up to get something to eat. Then we get bored, so maybe we watch TV. Then we get uncomfortable,
and have to change positions. Even each pleasurable moment is brief, and fails to bring lasting satisfaction.
So on, and so forth. We just keep suering!
The source of this suering is attachment.

We are attached to pleasurable things because we crave

them. We are also attached to things that are not pleasant, because they occupy our mind and we cannot
be free.

The Buddha says, Free yourself from pleasure and pain.

pain, there is only sorrow (in Byrom, 1993).

For in craving pleasure or in nursing

It may seem strange that we would be attached to our

pain, but the word is used dierently here than in most of Western psychology. Traditionally, psychologists
think of attachment in a positive way, such as the attachment a child feels toward his or her parents.
And yet, some cognitive psychologists do talk about individuals whose automatic thoughts lead them into
consistently negative states of mind by disqualifying positive events, catastrophizing events, taking everything
too personally, etc. (Pretzer and Beck, 2005). In Buddhism, attachment is neither positive nor negative,
it is simply anything that reects our illusion that the natural world is real. Only when we let go of our
attachments to this world can we be one with the universal spirit, and only then can we end our suering.

341

There is also something hopeful in suering. Bodhidharma taught that every suering is a Buddha-seed,
because suering leads us to seek wisdom (in Red Pine, 1987). In this analogy, he describes the body and
mind as a eld. Suering is the seed, wisdom the sprout, and Buddhahood the grain.

Discussion Question: Gotama Buddha taught that suering is the result of craving or desire. Many
of us have heard the saying that money is the root of all evil. Is our society excessively focused on buying
more and bigger things? Do you ever nd yourself obsessed with some material purchase? What problems,
if any, have you experienced because people were more concerned with getting things than caring about the
people around them?

Selessness
In keeping with its origins in Yoga, Buddhism teaches that there is no immortal, unchanging soul. All
that we are is a temporary collection of attributes, made up of the body, the feelings, the perceptions, the
reactions, and the consciousness of the mind (which, coming from the brain, is really part of the body). It
is because we confuse our true self (the transcendental self ) with this temporary collection of illusory things
that we crave satisfaction, and ultimately suer as a result. Now it may seem illogical to reject everything
we are familiar with, including our own physical body, as an illusion, but Buddhists would suggest that there
is a danger in choosing intellectual logic over faith. According to D.T. Suzuki (1962), Faith lives and the
intellect kills. Try the following exercise. Consider your body. Is it real? How much food have you eaten in
your life, and where is it now? How many times have you gone to the bathroom, and where did all of that
come from? It certainly isn't the same as when you ate it! Your body has been replaced many, many times.
It is being replaced right now. It isn't real, it is only temporary, ever changing. The same is true with your
mind. Even when William James discussed the stream of consciousness, he described a constantly changing
awareness, one in which you cannot have the same thought twice. It just isn't possible. James (1892) realized

substantial identity continuing
functional identity. Arriving at a

that we cannot establish a

from day to day, but concluded that our sense of

continuity must reveal a

very dierent conclusion, Buddhists consider this

to be maya, our inability to see things as they truly are (Suzuki, 1960).
These three characteristics of existence (impermanence, suering, and selessness) can be somewhat
unsettling. It is not very appealing to believe that we don't really exist, that we will suer as long as we
believe we do exist, and all of it will just eventually pass away anyway. So, how does one continue in this
practice? It is important to keep as our goal a true understanding of the way things are, and the practice
of meditation and other aspects of Yoga and Buddhism will help to deepen our realization of these basic
truths (Goldstein & Korneld, 2001).

The practice remains challenging, however, because as we deepen

our understanding the characteristic most often occupying the center of our greatest realization is that of
suering (Goldstein & Korneld, 2001; Suzuki, 1962). We must then put aside our intellectualizing, we must
slay it and throw it to the dogs, experiencing what Buddhists call the Great Death (Suzuki, 1962). Only
then will we know the greatest wisdom and compassion. This is the beginning of our transcendence. It is not
a separation from others, but a realization that we are all one. In other words, we are all in this together.

Interbeing  A Connection Between All People and All Things
Many people are familiar with the golden rule: do unto others as you would have others do unto you!
This Christian saying also has great implications when considered from a Buddhist perspective. Based on
the same philosophical/cosmological perspective as Yoga, Buddhists believe that there is one universal spirit.
Therefore, we are really all the same, indeed the entire universe of living creatures and even inanimate objects
in the physical world come from and return to the same, single source of creation.

Thus, we could alter

the golden rule to something like: as you do unto others you are doing unto yourself ! This concept is not
simply about being nice to other people for your own good, however. Much more importantly, it is about
appreciating the relationships between all things. For example, when you drink a refreshing glass of milk,
maybe after eating a few chocolate chip cookies, can you taste the grass and feel the falling rain? After all,
the cow could not have grown up to give milk if it hadn't eaten grass, and the grass would not have grown
if there hadn't been any rain. When you enjoy that milk do you remember to thank the farmer who milked
the cow, or the grocer who sold the milk to you? And what about the worms that helped to create and
aerate the soil in which the grass grew? Appreciating the concept of interbeing helps us to understand the
importance of everyone and everything.

CHAPTER 14. YOGA AND BUDDHISM AS PERSONALITY
DEVELOPMENT PATHS

342

The value of this concept of interbeing is that it can be much more than simply a curious academic topic.
The Vietnamese Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh writes very eloquently about interbeing and its potential
for promoting healthy relationships, both between people and between societies (Thich Nhat Hanh, 1995):
Looking deeply means observing something or someone with so much concentration that the distinction
between observer and observed disappears. The result is insight into the true nature of the object. When we
look into the heart of a ower, we see clouds, sunshine, minerals, time, the earth, and everything else in the
cosmos in it. Without clouds, there could be no rain, and there would be no ower. Without time, the ower
could not bloom. In fact, the ower is made entirely of non-ower elements; it has no independent, individual
existence. It inter-is with everything else in the universe.

. . . When we see the nature of interbeing, barriers

between ourselves and others are dissolved, and peace, love, and understanding are possible. Whenever there
is understanding, compassion is born. (pg. 10)
Having understood this concept, how might it apply to personality? One of the best known cross-cultural
topics in psychology today is the distinction between collectivistic vs. individualistic cultures (Triandis &
Suh, 2002; Triandis et al., 1988).

It is generally accepted that Western cultures focus on the individual,

whereas Eastern cultures focus on society as a collective group. One can easily imagine how people whose
religious and cultural philosophy focus on a single, universal spirit (the basis of interbeing) would focus
more on their family and societal groups than on the individual.

Both individualistic and collectivistic

cultures seem to have advantages. People living in individualistic cultures report higher levels of subjective
well-being and self-esteem, whereas people in collectivistic cultures have tend to have lower levels of stress
and correspondingly lower levels of cardiovascular disease (Triandis & Suh, 2002; Triandis et al., 1988).
In collectivistic cultures people tend to view the environment as relatively xed, and themselves as more
exible, more ready to t in (Triandis & Suh, 2002). The collectivistic perspective supports the value of
social cooperation and social interest (something Alfred Adler would likely appreciate). Still, even within
cultures there are individual dierences. There are idiocentric persons (those who favor individuality) living
in collectivistic cultures, and allocentric persons (those who favor ingroups) living in individualistic cultures.
The best relationship between personality and culture may be the culture t model, which suggests that
it is best to live in the culture that matches your personal inclinations.

Discussion Question: The concept of interbeing suggests that all things are ultimately connected.
Have you ever taken the time to think about all the things that had to happen, and all the people who were
involved, in producing anything you hold in your hand? What about all the things that had to happen, and
all the people who were involved, in your creation? And if we are all connected in some way, if we are all
interbeing, what have you done to value those relationships?

Connections Across Cultures: The Non-Violent Struggles of Mahatma Gandhi,
Thich Nhat Hanh, Martin Luther King, Jr., and the 14 th Dalai Lama
The four men listed above are famous in a variety of ways, but they are probably best known for their
commitment to nonviolence as a way to achieve political and social justice. Most importantly, they vowed
non-violence while those around them were committed to terrible violence in order to deny justice to others.
The two who are not alive today were both assassinated, and the other two were forced to live in exile.
Gandhi was a Hindu who practiced Yoga, Thich Nhat Hanh and the Dalai Lama are Buddhists, and M. L.
King, Jr. was a Christian, and it was their spiritual beliefs that so profoundly determined those aspects of
their personalities that demanded peace.
Gandhi (1869-1948) is considered the father of modern India. He was born when the British ruled India,
and spent much of his life ghting for the independence of his homeland. Twice he was imprisoned by the
government, even though he insisted that all protests should be nonviolent.
a movement of nonviolence known as

Indeed, he had established

Satyagraha. Ultimately this movement was successful, and India

achieved its independence. Gandhi, however, was assassinated less than a year later. As he died, he spoke
the name of God: Rama (Easwaran, 1972; Wilkinson, 2005).
Thich Nhat Hanh (1926-present) was born in Vietnam, and saw his country dominated rst by the French
and then by communists. During those dicult times he helped to develop what he and his friends called
engaged Buddhism. Rather than sitting in the temple meditating, they went out into the villages and tried
to help the poor people of Vietnam. When confronted by soldiers they did their best to remain mindful, and

to feel compassion for the soldiers who threatened them. After all, it was clear to Thich Nhat Hanh that
many of those young soldiers were frightened themselves, and so their behavior was very hard to predict.
Thus, the calm and peace that accompany mindfulness was often essential for protecting everyone in those
terrifying encounters. After being exiled from Vietnam in 1966, he established a community called Plum
Village in France, where he still resides today (Thich Nhat Hanh, 1966, 2003).
Martin Luther King, Jr. (1929-1968) was a major gure in America's civil rights movement of the 1950s
and 60s. The King children learned at an early age about the realities of racism in America. Coming from
an educated and socially active family, both his father and grandfather were ministers, he vowed at an early
age to work against racial injustice. According to his sister, he said he would turn the world upside down
(Farris, 2003). However, he always insisted on doing so in a nonviolent fashion. For this commitment to
nonviolence, in 1964 he became the youngest person to ever receive the Nobel Peace Prize. Despite the peace
prize and the passage of both the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act in 1965, discrimination
continued in America. So did the nonviolent protests led by Dr. King. Then, in 1968, Martin Luther King,
Jr. was assassinated (Burns, 2004; Hansen, 2003; Patrick, 1990).
The Dalai Lama (1935-present) lives in exile in India, though he also spends a great deal of time in
America. When China invaded Tibet in 1950, he appealed to the United Nations, other countries, and even
tried to reach an agreement with the Chinese leadership. Eventually, however, he was forced to leave Tibet
in 1959.

Today, nearly 50 years later, he continues to seek a peaceful resolution resulting in freedom for

Tibet. He also works to deliberately cultivate feelings of compassion for the Chinese, believing that someday
those who have harmed the people of Tibet will have to face the consequences of their actions (Dalai Lama,
2002). The Dalai Lama received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989.
These men have more in common than simply their shared belief in nonviolence.

In addition to M.

L. King, Jr. and the Dalai Lama receiving the Nobel Peace Prize, as Nobel Laureates are entitled to do,
Dr.

King nominated Thich Nhat Hanh for the same award.

Dr.

King had received a letter from Thich

Nhat Hanh asking for help in protesting the Vietnam war, which by the 1960s involved the United States.
Dr.

King was impressed by the Buddhist monk, and once appeared with him at a press conference in

Chicago (Burns, 2004).

Dr.

King was also familiar with and impressed by the teachings of Gandhi.

In

1959 he traveled to India to learn rsthand about Gandhi's Satyagraha, the basis for Gandhi's nonviolent
independence movement (King, 2000). In 1966, Dr. King delivered the Gandhi Memorial Lecture at Howard
University (Hansen, 2003).

Since both the Dalai Lama and Thich Nhat Hanh are alive today, they have

met one another and the Dalai Lama has written several forewords for books by Thich Nhat Hanh. If these
men from dierent countries and dierent cultures can share so much through the simple (though not easy)
practice of nonviolence, perhaps there is something special here for everyone to learn more about.

Meditation

Meditation Techniques
Meditation is the means by which we control our mind and guide it in a more virtuous direction (Dalai
Lama, 2001). Modern brain imaging techniques have even begun to identify the brain regions involved in
these processes (Barinaga, 2003). There are many dierent meditation techniques in Yoga and Buddhism,
and no one technique is necessarily better than another.

What is most important is to pick one type of

meditation and stick with it. Meditation takes practice. Most of us nd it very dicult to relax and clear
our mind. Even when we do, it is dicult to stay relaxed and keep our mind clear. We are distracted by
constant thoughts, getting uncomfortable, we have itches and sneezes and whatever. . . But over time we can
get better at relaxing. It helps to have a well-described procedure, and it can be very helpful to meditate
in a group (especially if they oer classes or lessons on how to meditate). If you try meditation, don't get
discouraged the rst few times. Keep it up. As with all paths toward self-improvement, it takes time to
progress in your ability to meditate.
Some of the writings of Master Dogen (1200-1253), the monk who founded Japanese Soto Zen, have
survived during the 800 years since he lived (in Cook, 2002). Master Dogen recommends a very traditional
form of seated meditation. Basically, sit straight up on a comfortable cushion with your legs crossed. Place
your right hand in your lap, palm up, and your left hand on your right hand in the same manner, so that
your thumbs touch slightly. Keep the eyes slightly open, the mouth closed, and breathe softly. Next comes

the hard part: Think about the unthinkable. How do you think about the unthinkable? Non-thinking.
Non-thinking may sound strange, but it is a fascinating experience for those who achieve it.

It can

actually make a 3- or 6-hour mediation seem to go by more quickly than a shorter meditation in which you
never quite clear your mind. If it sounds a little too strange, don't worry, it isn't the goal of every form of
meditation. Some forms of meditation focus on a mantra, or in Christian mediation a short prayer. Trying
to focus on God through the celestial eye (in the middle of the forehead) is also a common technique. The
Dalai Lama describes several dierent approaches in one of his books (Dalai Lama, 2001), and Thich Nhat
Hanh discusses being reasonable in one's approach to longer meditations (Thich Nhat Hanh, 1991). Once
again, there is not a right or wrong method of meditation.

Whatever technique you try, whether from a

book, a guru, a teacher, or a group, it is whatever works for you on your path to personal development.

Soto Zen and Zazen
Soto Zen is one of the two forms of Zen popular in Japan. Soto Zen emphasizes

zazen, which translates

loosely as sitting meditation. It is believed that this form of meditation, common to the way most Americans
envision meditation, is a tribute to the legend of Zen founder Bodhidharma spending nine years meditating
while staring at a wall (Suzuki, 1962). However, there is a problem in the literature on zazen. For those
who believe that zazen can help to achieve Buddhahood, the masters have taught that it cannot work. Still,
it remains the essential core practice. How can this be? According to Alan Watts (1957), it may be better
to consider an alternative translation of zazen, in which it translates as sitting just to sit.

In this view,

zazen results in a clear mind, the condition necessary for enlightenment. A wonderful resource for practicing
basic meditation of this type has been provided by Jack Korneld, a clinical psychologist who trained as a
Buddhist monk.

Meditation for Beginners

(Korneld, 2004) not only briey describes the history, purpose,

and benets of meditation, but it also includes a CD with guided meditations led by the author.

Rinzai Zen and the Koan
The other form of Zen popular in Japan is Rinzai Zen, founded by the monk Eisai (1141-1215). Buddhists
in the Rinzai school practice zazen, but they also emphasize the curious practice of meditating on a koan,
a riddle that has no answer. The Soto school of Zen frowns upon the use of the koan, considering it to be
supercial and possibly misguided, something of a gimmick. But within the Rinzai school the Zen masters
became concerned about what they saw as problems within the communities practicing Zen. One of the chief
concerns of the Rinzai masters was the reliance on absolute quietude, pure meditation purely for the sake
of meditation. They believed that Zen comes from life, and therefore must grow out of life (Suzuki, 1962).
They were also concerned about the intellectualization of Zen, the belief that discerning logic could lead
to enlightenment (again, concerned that the pursuit of logical ideas became its own pursuit). And so they
developed the

koan. The purpose of these unsolvable riddles is to put an end to logical thinking, to stop

the wandering minds of students and to create a profound sense of doubt in the student's mind (Reps and
Senzaki, 1994; Suzuki, 1960, 1962; Watts, 1957). The presentation of the student's views on a koan to the
Zen master is an important time, and advanced students may even challenge whether the master appreciates
how deeply the student understands Zen. These periodic visits to the Zen master to present an answer to a
koan are known as

sanzen (Suzuki, 1962; Watts, 1957).

Although koan are considered unsolvable, they do have answers. Certainly the most famous koan is the
one in which the monk Joshu is asked: Does a dog have Buddha-nature? Joshu replied, Mu!

Mu is the

Chinese symbol for no thing or not. The understanding of this koan is not found in the odd answer, or in
Joshu's apparent refusal to provide a straight answer, Mu is Buddha-nature! If you nd this particularly
dicult to understand, I suggest you back up to the quote I gave you from the writings of Bodhidharma. I
doubt it will make it any more clear, but perhaps it will help to illuminate the philosophy of non-attachment:
don't worry too hard about understanding, just understand.
A student of the Rinzai school of Zen will actually study many koan, and the process is kept quite secret.
Obviously if the answers to these koan were known, then students could oer the apparent answers. I say
apparent answers because a Zen master would clearly recognize the mindless answer of one who really does
not understand the koan. Since the process is kept secret, not many koan are publicly known, but there are
some available. Not all koan are quite as odd as Joshu's Mu; some are seemingly easier to understand, but
challenge our concepts of dening aspects of the natural world. For example, the monk Daie used to carry

a short bamboo stick, and he would say, If you call this a stick, you arm; if you call it not a stick, you
negate. Beyond armation and negation, what would you call it? (Suzuki, 1962) This is clearly a challenge
to move beyond logic, beyond the normal way of thinking about things. Enlightenment, of course, does not
come from normal ways. Through the use of meditation to clear our minds, and the use of koan to challenge
our perspectives, Rinzai Zen seeks to oer a path toward enlightenment that will be successful.

Discussion Question: Have you ever practiced meditation, or perhaps contemplative prayer? If you
have, how does it make you feel? If you haven't, does it sound attractive? Were you surprised to learn that
the practice of meditation is so old, and that it has counterparts in all of the major religions?

Mindfulness
Mindfulness is a form of meditation that occurs throughout every moment of the day. Indeed, it is very
important to live fully in every moment, and to look deeply into each experience (Thich Nhat Hanh, 1991,
1995).

By being mindful, we can enter into awareness of our body and our emotions.

Thich Nhat Hanh

relates a story in which the Buddha was asked when he and his monks practiced. The Buddha replied that
they practiced when they sat, when they walked, and when they ate.

When the person questioning the

Buddha replied that everyone sits, walks, and eats, the Buddha replied that he and his monks
were sitting,

knew

they were walking, and

knew

knew

they

they were eating (Thich Nhat Hanh, 1995). Mindfulness

can also be applied to acts as simple as breathing. According to Thich Nhat Hanh, conscious breathing is
the most basic Buddhist technique for touching peace (Thich Nhat Hanh, 1991, 1995). He suggests silently
reciting the following lines while breathing mindfully:
Breathing in, I calm my body.
Breathing out, I smile.
Dwelling in the present moment,
I know this is a wonderful moment!
The concept of mindfulness, viewed in its traditional way, is also being used today in psychotherapy.
Two recent books address the use of mindfulness either in combination with cognitive behavioral therapy
to treat depression (McQuaid and Carmona, 2004) or as its own approach to the treatment of anxiety
(Brantley, 2003). McQuaid and Carmona (2004) discuss how combining cognitive behavioral therapy and
mindfulness together can provide a much stronger approach to treatment than either technique alone. Since
the approaches have much in common, they amplify the eectiveness of each, and given their dierences,
they oer a complete path to moving beyond simple recovery toward more positive self development. Dr.
Brantley (2003) moves more completely into the practice of mindfulness, emphasizing that it must become
a way of life. It is not simply a clever therapeutic technique or gimmick.

Discussion Question: Mindfulness refers to maintaining a meditative state throughout the day. A
similar approach is essential to cognitive/behavioral therapy. Are you aware of what you do during the day,
or are you overwhelmed with being too busy? Could you see the practice of mindfulness as a helpful way to
deal with your hectic life, and perhaps reduce stress at the same time?

Enlightenment and the Ideal Person

Concepts of Enlightenment

There are a wide variety of dierent concepts of enlightenment. One concept that is somewhat familiar
in America is

nirvana. Nirvana refers to the extinction of all ideas and concepts, thus resulting in the end

of suering due to the craving that results from being attached to anything in the natural world. In the
Theravada tradition this should be the goal of all Buddhists, and a person who achieves nirvana is referred
to as an

Arhat. Other Buddhists, however, seek to avoid nirvana, because it leaves all others behind.

In the Mahayana tradition, an ideal person would be a Bodhisattva, one who vows to forego complete
enlightenment until all other beings have been enlightened.

According to Thich Nhat Hanh (1995), such

individuals touch mindfulness, and as a result of living mindfully they can touch the Buddha and shine
their light of awareness on everything they do. The desire to help others achieve enlightenment comes from

Bodhisattvas. Mindfulness leads to this compassion, as it leads one to
Bodhicitta. Bodhicitta, which means mind of enlightenment or mind of love, is an inner drive

the deep compassion developed by
develop

to fully realize oneself and to work for the well-being of all (in other words, it is the driving force of being a
Bodhisattva; Dalai Lama, 2001; Thich Nhat Hanh, 1995, 1999).

CHAPTER 14. YOGA AND BUDDHISM AS PERSONALITY
DEVELOPMENT PATHS

346

Curiously, some Buddhists distinguish between bodhi as a temporary ash of enlightenment, which
can even occur following arduous meditation or by accident, and nirvana or true liberation, which can
only result from proper knowledge and dedicated practice (Mathew, 2001). This concept is similar to what
Maslow described as the dierence between a peak experience and a plateau experience. A peak experience
is a brief period of fulllment, usually associated with a particular event. A plateau experience, on the other
hand, is a lasting feeling of oneness with the world around us.

What is of particular importance for the

study of personality is the recognition that individuals with certain personality characteristics, such as being
kind-hearted and open-minded, can more easily accomplish long-term fulllment, whether we call it nirvana
or self-actualization.

Compassion and Loving-Kindness
Just as compassion is the wish that all sentient beings be free of suering, loving-kindness is the wish
that all may enjoy happiness (Dalai Lama, 2001). With these simple words about Buddhism, His Holiness
the Dalai Lama has captured the history of psychology briey presented in the introductory chapter: that
psychology focused for many years on helping to identify and treat mental illness (hopefully freeing people
from suering), whereas now there is a strong movement toward positive psychology (hoping to improve wellbeing for all). This recognition of compassion as the strong feeling or wish that others be freed from suering
comes from mindfulness. As one becomes truly aware of the suering involved in human life, and if one is
able to feel genuine empathy for others, then compassion naturally arises (Chappell, 2003; Dalai Lama, 2001;
Goldstein & Korneld, 2001; Thich Nhat Hanh, 1995). Compassion has described as the ideal emotional
state (Bankart et al., 2003; Cook, 2002; Dockett & North-Schulte, 2003; Ragsdale, 2003), and Carl Rogers
considered genuine empathy to be essential for client-centered therapy to be successful. Aside from Rogers,
however, have other psychologists begun to examine the value of compassion and loving-kindness?

The

answer is an unequivocal Yes (Bankart et al., 2003; Batson et al., 2005; Cassell, 2005; Dockett & NorthSchulte, 2003; Keyes & Lopez, 2005; Khong, 2003; Ragsdale, 2003; Schulman, 2005; Young-Eisendrath,
2003)!

Life is so hard, how can we be anything but kind?
- Korneld, 1994

14.9 Obstacles to Personal Growth: The Three Poisons of Buddhism
Buddhists believe in

three poisons, the great obstacles to personal development. They are greed, anger,

and delusion. These poisons, or realms as they are often called, have no nature of their own, they are created
by us and they depend on us. Greed ows from attachment, anger ows from our emotions, and delusion
ows from maya. By following the practices of Buddhism, we can free ourselves from these poisons as did
the Buddha. According to Bodhidharma, the Buddha made three vows. He vowed to put an end to all evil,
by practicing moral prohibitions to counter the poison of greed. He vowed to cultivate virtue by practicing
meditation to counter the poison of anger.

And he vowed to liberate all beings by practicing wisdom to

counter the poison of delusion (in Red Pine, 1987).

Likewise, we can devote ourselves to the three pure

practices of morality, meditation, and wisdom.
It is interesting to note how well this philosophy ts with the growing eld of positive psychology (e.g.,
see Compton, 2005; Peterson, 2006).

Indeed, whole books have been written on the study of virtue in

psychology (Fowers, 2005; Peterson & Seligman, 2004). Note, however, that these books are quite recent.
Although the seeds of positive psychology, studies on virtue and similar topics have been around since the
earliest days of psychology in the Western world, we seem to be just starting to discover concepts that
have been well established in Eastern philosophy/psychology for thousands of years. As we recognize more
similarities between traditional Eastern perspectives and current Western perspectives, it may help to guide
these developing areas of psychological research in the Western world.

14.10 Zen Buddhism in America
Zen Buddhism is probably the best-known school of Buddhism in America due to the inuence of D. T.
Suzuki, who rst visited America in the year 1897. Suzuki was a renowned Buddhist scholar, who wrote
extensively on Zen Buddhism and its relationships to such diverse topics as Christian mysticism (Suzuki,
1957) and psychoanalysis, the latter book being co-authored by Erich Fromm (Suzuki et al., 1960).

Zen

Buddhism has also made its way into popular literature in the United States. The famous Beat generation
author Jack Kerouac, who had many discussions with D. T. Suzuki (Suzuki taught for a few years at Columbia
University, which happened to be Kerouac's alma mater), wrote a most entertaining book about his own

The Dharma Bums (Kerouac, 1958). And there
Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, rst published in

pursuits on the path of Zen called

was the immensely

popular classic entitled

1974 (Pirsig, 1999),

which opened the eyes of a whole new generation of Americans to the philosophy of the Far East.
Buddhism, and Zen Buddhism in particular, is also beginning to have more and more inuence on
psychotherapy in America today. Although a discussion of therapy techniques is beyond the scope of this
chapter, it is becoming easy to nd such material.

There are books on Zen and psychotherapy (Brazier,

1995; Mruk and Hartzell, 2003), Buddhism and well-being (Brach, 2003), comparisons of psychoanalysis and
Buddhism (Epstein, 1995; Suzuki et al., 1960), and a variety of chapters in spiritually oriented handbooks
on psychotherapy (e.g., Cooper, 2005; Corbett & Stein, 2005; Crawford, 2005; Finn & Rubin, 2000; Luko
& Lu, 2005; Roland, 2005; Sharma, 2000; Tan & Johnson, 2005). Not only does this blending of Eastern and
Western philosophy promise to expand the horizons and potential eectiveness of psychotherapy, learning
more about the dierent cultural perspectives that led to these dierent lifestyles will help to prepare
psychologists to recognize more quickly and easily the culturally-related issues that are aecting their patients
or clients.

Sangha: A Community Practicing Together
The concepts of togetherness, friendship, social support, etc. are certainly well known in the West, despite
the fact that Western cultures are generally considered to be individualistic.

Adler identied developing

friendships as one of three main tasks in life, and the value of social support during times of stress and grief
has been well documented. In Yoga and Buddhism these concepts have been central for thousands of years.

Three Jewels (also known as the Three Gems or the Three Refuges): the Buddha,
Dharma, and the Sangha. A Buddha is one who is fully enlightened (not just Gotama Buddha), and

Buddhists refer to the
the

the Dharma is the way of understanding and love taught by Gotama Buddha. A Sangha is a community
of Buddhists who practice the Dharma and seek enlightenment together (Suzuki, 1960; Thich Nhat Hanh,
1995). The Sangha is not, however, just a get-together of companions with similar interests. The Sangha
can renew our inspiration and energy, and it can help us to keep practicing when our own motivation wanes
(Goldstein & Korneld, 1987). The energy and motivation we gain from being part of a Sangha can help
us to develop Bodhicitta, the altruistic desire to help all people achieve enlightenment. The ceremony to
actively generate Bodhicitta within us begins with a series of visualizations in which we imagine Gotama
Buddha being with us, surrounded by other Buddhas, great sages, and all sentient beings (Dalai Lama,
2001). Being lled with Bodhicitta makes us a Bodhisattva right away (Thich Nhat Hanh, 1999). This is
not simply a belief or devotion, however. Taking refuge in the Sangha is a practice, one that can only take
place in the company of others and with their support (Thich Nhat Hanh, 1995).
The Sangha is by no means unique to Buddhism. In Yoga they refer to Satsanga, associating with the
truth or with someone virtuous such as a guru (Feuerstein, 2003; Yogananda, 1946). I remember when a
monk, and a monk in training, from the Self Realization Fellowship visited the Yoga retreat center I visit.
During the evening they oered Satsanga, a brief lesson followed by a question and answer discussion. In
this semi-formal setting we were all able to expand our understanding of Yoga and share our interests and
experiences. Indeed, some people practicing traditional Yoga or Buddhism consider the guru (or lama, in
Tibetan) to be a fourth jewel in which to seek refuge (Feuerstein, 2003).

Discussion Question: Buddhists strongly support a Sangha, a community of believers.

Can you

imagine practicing Buddhism alone? What about your own personal groups, whether church groups, clubs,
friends, family, etc.? Are they supportive? How important are those groups to the way you live your life,
and could you imagine your life without them?

A Final Note
This chapter and the one that follows have very religious overtones. So I would like to say a little more
about the importance of covering these topics in a personality textbook. Alfred Adler said that if you want
to understand someone, look at their style of life. As stated at the outset of this chapter, I have tried to
present this material as guides for one's lifestyle that have developed within dierent cultures. There are
three basic moral codes that inuence our lives: community, autonomy, and divinity (see Triandis & Suh,
2002). In collectivistic cultures there is an emphasis on community moral codes, whereas autonomy codes
are more inuential in individualistic cultures. Both cultures emphasize moral codes related to divinity (as
religion or spirituality). If we tried to separate religious culture absolutely from our study of personality,
we might very well end up with an academic discipline that misses the richness and wonder of human life.
More importantly, what happens to people who ignore spirituality in their own development?

Abraham

Maslow lamented the defense mechanism of desacralization, the failure of people to consider anything to be
truly important and meaningful. Yehudi Menuhin, in his introduction to

Light on Yoga

by B. K. S. Iyengar

(1966), oers a striking impression of those who do not seek harmony with the universe:
What is the alternative? Thwarted, warped people condemning the order of things, cripples criticizing
the upright, autocrats slumped in expectant coronary attitudes, the tragic spectacle of people working out
their own imbalance and frustration on others. (pg. 12)
I don't know whether Maslow considered desacralization to be this frightening a possibility, but it certainly
gives one reason to consider the value of spiritual aspects of human development, especially since spirituality
is one of the cultural universals (Ferraro, 2006a; Murdock, 1945). And given that spirituality is universal,
these matters are certainly not unique to Eastern culture. In the next chapter we will consider spiritually
guided lifestyle recommendations as they apply to cultures inuenced by the Abrahamic religions: Judaism,
Christianity, and Islam.

Personality Theory in Real Life: Are You Really You?
We ended the rst chapter in this book by asking an interesting question: Who are you? In this chapter,
we have addressed the possibility that everything you know about yourself is an illusion, and that even
knowing is an illusion. How can this be? The answer may be found, or perhaps not found, in the mystery
that is God. The Christian Bible teaches that God's ways are not Man's ways. Paramahansa Yogananda
provides a marvelous image of the mystery of the Godhead being so far beyond our comprehension that
it dees description (Yogananda, 1946); and Dante's awesome description of the appearance of the divine
essence in

Paradiso

is dicult to envision, even as one reads Dante's words (in Milano, 1947). Perhaps some

things are beyond our comprehension.
How then, should we proceed to live our life?

Based on the concept of Karma, our past actions will

inuence our future experiences. Consider things you have done in your life. Have you regretted some of
them? Did they seem out of character for you? Try to determine if unfortunate events followed those actions
you regret. On the positive side, are there things you have done that make you proud or happy? Have those
things involved other people, or were they done for other people?

Try to determine whether those good

things you have done resulted in favorable consequences for you and for others.
Now, here comes the tricky part. When you have done good things, do they feel more like you than the
bad things did? If the answer is yes, it may be that you have begun to touch something special within yourself.
You are responsible for both the good things and the bad things you have done in this life. But perhaps
the good things feel better, feel more like you, because they begin to connect you with your transcendental
self, that spark of the divine within you, which may be called spirit or soul. Thinking this way is a deep
and powerful challenge, which requires you to have some faith in yourself. Meditate on this, and see what
happens!

14.11 Review of Key Points
•

Although Yoga and Buddhism have signicant religious overtones, they are actually lifestyle guidelines
that promote psychological well-being.

•

The principles of Yoga are outlined in the

Yoga Sutras

of Patanjali and in the

Bhagavad Gita,

both of

which are approximately 2,500 years old.

•

In Yoga there is a dichotomy between spirit and nature, with spirit being pure consciousness.

Our

belief that we are actually our physical selves (our natural self ) is an illusion.

•

Karma refers to the cosmic law of cause and eect. Our past actions, both good and bad, aect our
future.

•

Everything in the natural world is composed of three gunas: rajas (craving and action), tamas (ignorance and dullness), and sattva (light and joy).

•

A guru is a teacher, someone who is advanced in their practice of Yoga. The guru is essential for a
student to properly follow the complex teachings and practices of Yoga.

•

There are a wide variety of schools within Yoga, including Hatha-Yoga (which is popular in America),
Bhakti-Yoga (devotional Yoga), Kriya-Yoga (believed to be the original Yoga of Patanjali), and MantraYoga (which emphasizes the chanting of mantras, such as the sacred Om).

•

Patanjali described ve hindrances to personal development: avidya (ignorance), sense of personality,
desire, hate, and sense of attachment.

•

The ancient Vedic teachings propose four stages in the ideal life:

student, householder, hermit or

forest-dweller, renunciant.

•

Yoga is well established in America, having been taught formally for over 85 years. This mixing of
cultures has been possible, in part, because of similarities between Yoga and Christian practices. Two
such common practices are contemplative prayer (which is similar to meditation) and singing to God.

•

Buddhism is based on the 2,500 year-old teachings of Siddhattha Gotama, who is also known as Gotama
Buddha. Bodhidharma brought Zen Buddhism to China some 1,500 years ago, and the Dalai Lama is
a very famous Tibetan Buddhist leader alive today.

•

The Buddha taught that there are four noble truths: suering is a reality in human life, suering comes
from craving, the craving that leads to suering can be destroyed, the path to destroy craving is the
Middle Way (aka, the Eightfold Path).

•

Buddhists believe in three basic characteristics of existence:

nothing is permanent, suering is an

integral part of human life, and we have no immortal, unchanging soul.

•

The Buddhist concept of interbeing emphasizes the connection between all living things, and even
inanimate objects, because there is only one single source of all creation.

•

Meditation, the common element in all forms of Yoga and Buddhism, is a means for controlling our
mind and moving it in a more virtuous direction. Soto Zen emphasizes sitting meditation alone, whereas
Rinzai Zen adds to seated meditation the practice of meditating on a koan, an unsolvable riddle.

•
•

Mindfulness is the practice of maintaining a meditative state throughout our daily routine.
In a very general sense, enlightenment refers to transcending this life, thus eliminating craving and
suering and escaping from the cause and eect of karma.

In the Mahayana tradition, some Bud-

dhists forego complete enlightenment so that they might remain in the world to help others achieve
enlightenment.

•

The ideal emotional state for Buddhists is compassion.

Both compassion and loving-kindness ow

naturally from mindfulness, since mindful individuals recognize the reality of our existence.

•
•

Buddhists believe in three poisons, or obstacles to personal growth: greed, anger, and delusion.
Zen Buddhism has been taught in the United States for over 100 years.

It has found its way into

popular literature and has had a clear inuence on psychology.

•

Buddhists refer to the Three Jewels: the Buddha, the Dharma (the teachings of the Buddha), and
the Sangha (a community of Buddhists).

The importance of community is by no means unique to

Eastern thought, but certainly takes on great signicance in a culture that is generally recognized as
collectivistic.

Religious Perspectives on Personality

In the previous chapter, Yoga and Buddhism were presented as lifestyle choices, but it was acknowledged

Kabbalah,
Christian mysticism, and Susm, we cannot separate the lifestyle from the religion. However, one can
that they developed within a religious context. In this chapter we continue that trend, but for

easily make the argument that we should not ignore the inuence of religion on psychology. After all, both
spirituality and formal religion are signicant factors in the lives of many people, regardless of whether some
may not believe in the existence of God, or any other divine being(s).

It is also true that religion was a

signicant factor in the lives of many of the theorists we have examined in this book, and as a result, their
spiritual beliefs helped to shape the nature of their personality theories.
We will examine the mystical approaches that have developed within the Jewish, Christian, and Muslim
religions. These are the three Abrahamic religions, in the order in which they were established, and together
they cover an extraordinary range of cultural groups, including some 3½ billion people (55 percent of the
world's population; Haviland, Prins, Walrath, & McBride, 2005). Mysticism refers to the belief that one can
know the spiritual truths of life and the universe that are beyond the intellect by being absorbed into the

Deity through contemplation and self-surrender. In practice, they share common elements with Yoga and
Buddhism (particularly meditation), and by bringing these ve practices together, we have truly begun to
take a look at the personalities, within a cultural context, of people around the entire world.
It is important to keep in mind, however, that any of the theories we have examined so far might play a role
in personality development in any cultural group, in conjunction with the cultural inuences of spirituality
and religion. Thus, the ideas presented in these last two chapters are

not

meant to oer alternatives to what

we have discussed within traditional Western psychology. In addition, there are other signicant cultural
factors beside spirituality and religion, though few of them have been studied or contemplated as deeply as
religion. And undoubtedly, no other cultural phenomenon has been actively promoted and spread around
the world by missionaries of many dierent faiths, as has been the case with religion. It is important to be
open-minded and aware of some of the major factors underlying the dramatic cultural dierences that exist
around the world. Only then can we honestly connect with other people in a global community.

Judaism and Kabbalah
We will begin our examination of spiritual/religious guidelines for living one's life with the oldest, but
smallest, of the Abrahamic religions.

Judaism holds a special place in the history of psychology, since nearly

all of the early and most signicant psychodynamic theorists were Jewish (even if they did not practice their
faith). In addition, since many of those Jewish psychoanalysts came to America during the 1930s, they then
had a signicant eect on the continued development of psychodynamic theory and psychoanalysis here in
the United States.

The Foundation of the Jewish Faith
Judaism is one of the oldest religions in the world, and today some 14 million people practice this faith.
It is a monotheistic religion, thus believing that there is only one god:

1 This

Yahweh. They believe that Yahweh

called

Abraham out of his homeland to establish a new home, in the general area of modern-day Israel.

This occurred in approximately the year 1900 B.C. However, the formal foundation of Judaism involved the
establishment of Yahweh's laws, known as the

Torah. The Torah is not merely a set of laws or cultural

guidelines, but rather, they are a pattern for living that transforms the Jewish people into Yahweh's people
(Wilkins, 1967). The Torah is quite long, consisting of ve books, which include many complex rules for both
the people and the priesthood. However, the rules were greatly simplied in Yahweh's special revelation to
Moses on Mt. Sinai, around the year 1300 B.C., and these simplied guidelines for how to live one's life are
known as the

Ten Commandments:

I am the Lord your God. . .You shall have no other gods before me.
You shall not make for yourself a graven image. . .you shall not bow down to them
or serve them. . .
You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain. . .
Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.
Honor your father and your mother. . .
You shall not kill.
You shall not commit adultery.
You shall not steal.
You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.
You shall not covet your neighbor's house. . .your neighbor's wife. . .or anything
that is your neighbor's.

from Exodus, Chapter 20; Holy Bible
As simple as it might seem to follow these ten guidelines for living one's life, it is just as easy to ignore
them. Unfortunately, ignoring them has often been the case, even among some of the most famous people
in Jewish history. Thus, the mystical practice of Kabbalah has arisen, to both help people live a righteous
life, and to help them do so without having to guide their behavior by simple, yet strict, commandments.
In other words, there was, and is, a need to transform people's minds. In order to eect real change, we
cannot simply expect people to follow the rules, we need to help them make the rules a part of their life. In
this sense, Kabbalah, like Yoga, Buddhism, and as we shall see for Christian mysticism and Susm, can be
viewed as a sort of cognitive psychology, a redirection of one's conscious personality development.

Discussion Question: If the Ten Commandments are simply rules, as opposed to being an inherent
part of our lives, is anything missing? Are there things we would still be allowed to do that would harm
other people, or harm ourselves? What can we do to make the Ten Commandments a way of life, how can
we be mindful of them?

Kabbalah
Kabbalah is a path designed to teach people about their place in life and in the universe, particularly
with regard to the divine. It emphasizes that one's daily life should not be separated from one's spiritual
life. In more practical terms, Kabbalah deals with the everyday experience that we have unlimited desires,
but only limited resources to satisfy them. Thus, there will always be some degree of suering in our lives
if we focus only on the material world. Kabbalah teaches a pathway toward experiencing something beyond
simple materialism. And yet, that path remains obscured in a certain degree of secrecy. The principal books
are available only in the Hebrew and Aramaic languages, and some believe that Kabbalists who are qualied
to teach Kabbalah are all in the country of Israel (Besserman, 1997; Laitman, 2005). Accordingly, a distinct
degree of diculty in the study of Kabbalah is to be expected:
Whoever delves into mysticism cannot help but stumble, as it is written: This stumbling block is in your
hand. You cannot grasp these things unless you stumble over them. (pg. 163; Matt, 1995)
Kabbalah is as old as Judaism itself, perhaps older. Kabbalistic legend suggests that it may have begun
with Enoch, the great-grandfather of Noah (as in Noah's Ark; Halevi, 1986), but its formal practice recognizes
a few key historical events.

In the sixth century B.C., a collection of manuals called

Maaseh Merkavah

emerged, and these manuals included a formal meditation practice. For those who engaged in this practice,
the goal was to directly experience the Deity by concentrating on mandala-like images that showed a path
to the Throne of God (remember that Carl Jung also meditated on Mandala images). Their emphasis on

out-of-body experiences distinguished them from similar Babylonian schools of spirituality that emphasized
inner-directed visualizations and, therefore, were not as mystical as the Kabbalists. In the second century

Zohar (translated as the Book
Book of Radiance ), which was hidden in a cave in Israel and studied in secret until, around
the year 1280 A.D., a Spanish Kabbalist named Moses de Leon published the Zohar. In the late 1500s, Rabbi
A.D., Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai wrote an important Kabbalist text called the

of Splendor

or the

Yitzhak Luria began teaching Kabbalah, and he contributed a number of additional inuential books, such
as

Etz Hachayim (The Tree of Life ), Sha'ar HaKavanot (The Gateway on Intentions ), and Sha'ar Hagilgulim
Gateway of Reincarnation). Known as the Ari (the Lion), he established a basic system for studying

(The

Kabbalah, which remains in use today (Besserman, 1997; Homan, 2007; Laitman, 2005).
The primary aspects of practicing Kabbalah are quite similar to what we saw with Buddhism. Surrendering oneself to Yahweh, and in the process annihilating one's ego (or concept of self ), in order to release one's
emotions is one of the main goals (Homan, 2007; Weiss, 2005). Meditation is a key practice, attempting to
immerse oneself in Yahweh manifested as self, thus fullling the self. A common technique is to meditate on
some Kabbalah teaching or a passage from the Bible. It is also highly recommended that Kabbalah be practiced within a group of other seekers, and under the guidance of a Rabbi (or teacher). Similar to Buddhist
mindfulness, Kabbalists also attempt to incorporate their practice into every moment of their daily lives.
As a result, the basic teachings of Judaism, such as the Ten Commandments, should become an individual's
way of life, rather than a distant set of rules merely to be obeyed (or not).
When you desire to eat or drink, or to fulll other worldly desires, and you focus your awareness on the
love of God, then you elevate that physical desire to spiritual desire. . .wherever you go and whatever you do
- even mundane activities - you serve God. (pg. 151; Matt, 1995)

Kabbalah and Psychology
The mystical approach to understanding life and individuals has an interesting history in the eld of
psychology, with William James, Carl Jung, and Abraham Maslow being among those most interested in
the study of spirituality and spiritual phenomena. As the meditation practices within Yoga and Buddhism
have gained popularity in psychology, other spiritual/mystical traditions are being re-examined as well.
Accordingly, Kabbalah is becoming more popular, both in Judaism and in psychology, and the links between
Kabbalah and psychology are being actively explored (e.g., Halevi, 1986; Homan, 2007; Weiss, 2005).
Kabbalah seems to compare most favorably with a cognitive approach to understanding personality and
healing broken relationships.

Kabbalah describes a complex arrangement of elements that underlie our

relationship with God, the universe, and consequently, ourselves and other people.

Understanding these

relationships is the key to balancing our emotions, thoughts, and styles of relating to others. Unhappiness
is viewed as the result of a serious imbalance in our understanding of the true nature of our place in our
community, society, and life itself.

While many dierent forms of psychotherapy help people to develop

insight into their personality and relationships, Kabbalah proposes to go beyond insight. Once again, for
those people who live life with a deep spiritual faith, ignoring one's faith makes it all but impossible to
nd balance in one's life.

Only a spiritual path, perhaps augmented by a traditional psychotherapeutic

emphasis on everyday problems and stressors, can help to balance the entire life of the spiritual person.
Thus, Kabbalah need not be viewed as an alternative to psychotherapy, but rather as a bridge between
psychology and spirituality (Weiss, 2005).
There is, however, a problem facing most psychologists when it comes to the study of Kabbalah. Being
based on spirituality and the unquestioned belief in Yahweh, Kabbalists are willing to examine questions that
are decidedly unscientic, such as Jung's concept of synchronicity. They also study the higher dimensions of
human existence, such as awakening ecstasy (Homan, 2007). In this regard their goals are similar to those
of Maslow, and his desire to understand self-actualization and its relationship to spiritual experiences, and
to the whole eld of positive psychology, and its emphasis on doing more for people than simply addressing
the adjustment disorders and/or mental illness of those suering psychological distress. Yet Kabbalah goes
even further into the realm of parapsychology, fully believing in reincarnation (Besserman, 1997; Homan,
2007; Laitman, 2005; Weiss, 2005). In 1988, psychiatrist Brian Weiss, Chairman Emeritus of Psychiatry at
the Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami, published

Kabbalistic view of reincarnation suggests an explanation for Jung's concept of the collective unconscious
(see also, Halevi, 1986), the use of past-life therapy may not be as strange as many would insist it must be.
In continuing to study this phenomenon, Dr. Weiss does not suggest simply accepting anyone's word that
reincarnation is real or that past-life therapy will help:
It is vital to carry your logical, rational mind on this journey. To accept everything without reection,
contemplation, and thoughtfulness would be just as foolish as rejecting everything in the same manner.
Science is the art of observing carefully with an unbiased, non-prejudicial eye. (pg. 7; Weiss, 2000)
Similar thoughts occurred to Carl Jung and Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, both of whom were nervous about
discussing their experiences with patients who reported near-death experiences.

experiences as his wife was dying.

However, they were so

Carl Rogers also reported similar

Thus, the Kabbalists are not simply a group of spiritualists reporting

events that are not considered real by any well-known psychologists or psychiatrists. The truth, however, is
likely to remain elusive for those who do not accept the evidence on faith.

Discussion Question: Whether or not you actually believe in reincarnation,

can you believe in it?

Can

past-life therapy be helpful even if it isn't real, or is it always a harmful delusion? Could reincarnation be
the explanation for Jung's collective unconscious, and if not, is there a conceivable middle ground?

Christianity and Christian Mysticism
Although there are many denominations within

Christianity, at times generating signicant conict

between each other, Christianity as a whole has been a profoundly successful and inuential religion. Approximately one-third of the world's population, over 2.2 billion people, are Christian, and it has spread
around the entire world. At its heart, Christianity is a simple religion, and those who live a truly Christian
life are guided by one simple philosophy: love your neighbor.

The Foundation of the Christian Faith
Approximately 2,000 years ago a man named

Jesus of Nazareth was born. For 30 years he lived a

simple life, but then embarked on a religious crusade that lasted for only 3 short years.

At the end of

those three years, he was crucied for having challenged the right of the religious and political authorities
to lead the people, as well as their decency in so doing.

However, he never outright challenged anyone,

always teaching love, mercy, and peace. Following his death and resurrection he has been called the
(meaning

Christ

Messiah, or anointed), hence the term Christianity.

Christians believed that Jesus was no ordinary man, but rather the son of God (Yahweh, the God of
Judaism).

They also believe that he was born of a virgin, through the power of the Holy Spirit.

although Christians believe in one God, they view God in a Trinitarian way:

Thus,

Father, Son, and Holy

Spirit (Wilkins, 1967). Although Judaic prophecy had foretold of the coming of a Messiah, they do not
believe that Jesus was that person. Yet, having arisen out of Judaism, Christians believe much of the Jewish
faith, including the importance of the Ten Commandments. However, when Jesus was challenged to identify
the most important of the commandments, he surprised those listening:
The rst is, `Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one; and you shall love the Lord your God
with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength.'
The second is this, `You shall love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no other commandment greater
than these.

from Mark, Chapter 12; Holy Bible
What is surprising about this answer is that Jesus simplied the Ten Commandments even further,
emphasizing just two, but those two commandments encompass both the spiritual and the social worlds love God, and love all people (the famous Good Samaritan parable teaches that all people are one another's
neighbors). Thus, it seems appropriate for us to address the social and psychological aspects of loving and/or
caring for other people, as well as for ourselves, as something separate from religious/spiritual pursuits. And
yet at the same time, we cannot, and need not, separate our psychological studies from a religious/spiritual
context (at least when trying to understand those people for whom religion and spirituality are important
daily factors).

Discussion Question: Love God, and love your neighbor as yourself. Is it really that simple?

Christian Mysticism

355

Christian Mysticism is as old as Christianity itself, for Jesus led a mystic life (Walker, 2003). Since that
time there have been many Christian mystics, but two particular groups stand out: the desert fathers and
the women mystics (Chervin, 1992; Clement, 1993; Waddell, 1998). As the Christian faith became legal,
following the conversion of the Roman emperor Constantine the Great late in the third century, Christianity
became caught up in the politics of the empire. Soon enough, a group of spiritual men sought to escape
worldly politics and secular distractions by becoming hermits. They traveled out into the Egyptian desert
and began monastic lives. In order to be with God, they did not merely seek solitude, but they also sought
to eliminate their sense of ego. This was attempted through what we might call contemplative prayer, or
simply meditation. However, the sense of ego does not go away easily:
The ego doesn't want us looking for God because when we nd God, the illusion of being an ego will be
destroyed. It will mean the end of our self-centered existence and all of its negative emotions. . .One cannot
see God and continue to live as a separate person. (pg. 49; Walker, 2003).
Thus, a battle arises between the sense of ego and one's eorts to immerse oneself in the Deity. This
spiritual combat, essentially the battle between good and evil, exists because of our freedom to choose our
path in life (Clement, 1993). It was in recognition of this challenge that the desert fathers sought the solitude
of the desert. There they were able to pursue the ecstasy of unknowing, that which is beyond the boundaries
of any human ability to comprehend or rationalize the experience:
At one time Zachary went to his abbot Silvanus, and found him in an ecstasy, and his hands were stretched
out to heaven. And when he saw him thus, he closed the door and went away: and coming back about the
sixth hour, and the ninth, he found him even so: but toward the tenth hour he knocked, and coming in found
him lying quiet. . .the young man held his fee saying, I shall not let thee go, until thou tell me what thou
hast seen. The old man answered him: I was caught up into heaven, and I saw the glory of God. And I
stood there until now, and now am I sent away. (pg. 130; Sayings of the Fathers, in Waddell, 1998)
Although there have been many mystics who were men, including the desert fathers, Meister Eckhart
(a favorite of Erich Fromm), and the anonymous author of

The Cloud of Unknowing

(see Kirvan, 1996a),

there have also been a number of well-known women mystics, such as Blessed Julian of Norwich (see Chilson,
1995), Saint Teresa of Avila (see Kirvan, 1996b), Saint Therese of Lisieux (Kirvan, 1996c), and most famous
of them all, Saint Joan of Arc (see Chervin, 1992). Given the patriarchal history of the Roman Catholic
Church, and the beginning of mysticism with the desert

fathers, it is enlightening to see that so many women

were blessed by God's grace and presence in a profound mystical fashion, and that this was recognized by
the Catholic Church (as many of these women became saints). Thus, God does not discriminate based on
gender. Indeed, in one mystical experience, St. Hildegard of Bingen (who lived from 1098-1179 A.D.) was
instructed to use the majesty of her mystical gift to instruct men in the true meaning of faith:

. . .as

I was gazing with great fear and trembling attention at a heavenly vision, I saw a great splendor in

which resounded a voice from Heaven, saying to me, O fragile human. . .Cry out and speak of the origin of
pure salvation until those people are instructed, who, though they see the inmost contents of the Scriptures, do
not wish to tell them or preach them, because they are lukewarm and sluggish in serving God's justice. . .Burst
forth into a fountain of abundance and overow with mystical knowledge, until they who now think you
contemptible because of Eve's transgression are stirred up by the ood of your irrigation. (pp. 17-18; St.
Hildegard of Bingen, cited in Chervin, 1992)

Christian Meditation
The practice of meditation as a form of contemplative prayer has continued to the present day, thanks in
part to two inuential monks who lived during the twentieth century: Thomas Merton, OCSO (1915-1968)
and John Main, OSB (1926-1982). Fr. Merton was a Trappist monk who wrote extensively on the monastic
life, contemplation and silence, and connections between Western and Eastern spiritual philosophies (e.g.,
Merton, 1948, 1951, 1977; Montaldo, 2001; Nouwen, 1972). Always supportive of these various approaches
to life, Fr.

Merton adopted one of Jung's objections to Freud's discounting of religion:

the observation

that many people in psychoanalysis (whether Catholic, Protestant, or Jewish) had at the core of their
dysfunction a religious crisis.

Whereas Freud blamed this problem on the failure of religion, Fr.

Merton

blamed the problem on a failure of faith:
The real religious problem exists in the soul of those of us who in their hearts believe in God, and who

recognize their obligation to love Him and serve Him - yet do not! (pg. 4; Merton, 1951)
While a monastic life may have allowed Fr. Merton to serve God with all his heart and soul, not everyone
can be a monk or a nun.

The Benedictine monk John Main sought to oer an easy path to meditation

practice for the average person. Having become interested in mantra meditation following his early career in
the Far East and his study of the writings of the desert fathers, Fr. Main began leading meditation groups at
a monastery in London. He continued these meditation groups in Montreal after establishing the Benedictine
priory there, and he also began sharing his interest in meditation through the publication of books such as

Word Into Silence
Following Fr.

(Main, 1980),

Moment of Christ

(Main, 1984), and

The Way of Unknowing

(Main, 1989).

Main's death, his devoted student Laurence Freeman, OSB continued teaching Christian

Meditation. In 1991, Fr. Freeman helped to establish the World Community for Christian Meditation, with
its headquarters in London, England, and he continues to serve as its director. Fr. Freeman has written
his own books on Christ as the inner source teaching us about life (Freeman, 1986, 2000), as well as some
very practical books on meditation practice and establishing a meditation group (Freeman, 1994, 2002,
2004). Both Fr. Main and Fr. Freeman recommended a simple mantra meditation, using the Aramaic word
 Maranatha, one of the oldest Christian prayers, which means simply Come Lord.

This simple, yet

spiritually deep, form of meditation comes quite easily to those who are willing to pursue this silent path to
contentment and being one with God.

Discussion Question: There is a long and ongoing history of Christian meditation. Were you aware of
this, or did you think that meditation and Christianity were unrelated? Does it seem appropriate to compare
meditation to contemplative prayer?

Islam and Susm
The last of the Abrahamic religions to be established,

Islam has also been a profoundly successful religion.
Muslims,

It ranks second in numbers only to Christianity, with some 1.5 billion followers around the world.

those who practice the Islamic faith, consider Jesus Christ to have been a great prophet, but they do not
consider him to be the Son of God. They follow the teachings of the one whom they believe to be the last
and greatest prophet:

Muhammad (Wilkins, 1967).

The Foundation of the Islamic Faith

Muhammad was born around 571 A.D., in Mecca (in modern-day Saudi Arabia). An upright and honest
man, Muhammad used to take refuge in a cave at Mount Hera, where he would contemplate (meditate?)
good and evil.
called

The religion of his time and region worshipped many spirits in the desert, including one

Allah. Muhammad came to believe that Allah was the one and only God, the creator of the universe.

Muhammad devoted the rest of his life to preaching Allah's message, and was soon literally run out of town
by the authorities. He ed to the city of Medina, in the year 622 A.D., a date which marks the beginning
of Muhammad's formal eorts to establish the religion of Islam. Muhammad became a great leader, in the
name of Allah, and when he died in the year 632 he controlled most of Arabia. Within one hundred years,
Islam had spread around the Mediterranean to Europe, throughout North Africa, and to India in the East
(Wilkins, 1967).
Muslims believe that Muhammad was directly descended from Abraham, through Abraham's son Ishmael.
Ishmael was the half-brother of Isaac, through whom the Jewish people trace their heritage to Abraham. He
received his revelation from Allah through the angel Gabriel, and wrote it down in the

Holy Qur'an, the

holy book of Islam (the rst English translation by a Muslim generally available in the West was originally
published in 1917, and has seen numerous new editions since then; Ali, 2002). Like Judaism and Christianity,
Islam has a fairly simple set of guidelines for living one's life (Fadiman & Frager, 1997; Wilkins, 1967), known
as the
1.

Five Pillars of Islam:

Bearing Witness,

or the Confession of Faith, to Allah and to his chosen

prophet Muhammad.
2.

5.

aord to do so.
Two elements seem to stand out from the Five Pillars. First, Islam requires an active demonstration of
one's faith in Allah. Second, every Muslim must follow through on that faith with good works, particularly
the fasting during Ramadan and the giving of charity to the poor. Thus, neither faith nor good works alone
are adequate for those who claim to be Muslim, they must incorporate both into their lives.

Discussion Question: The Five Pillars of Islam seem to be much more directly related to demonstrating
one's faith in God than we saw with Judaism or Christianity. Do Muslims seem more religious than other
religions? Is your answer just an impression, or is it based on real experience? In your opinion, how do the
Five Pillars of Islam compare to the Ten Commandments or Jesus' two commandments?

Connections Across Cultures: Islamic Faith,
Jihad, Ascesis, and Democracy
When considering the Five Pillars of Islam, it is hard to imagine why there is such a negative view of the
Islamic religion in the Western world, particularly in the United States. The answer is actually quite simple,
but it is based on a terrible misunderstanding: radical Islamic fundamentalism, and its common element of
terrorism, is viewed in the West as being synonymous with Islam itself. As noted in the main text, Maulana
Muhammad Ali was the rst Muslim to translate the Holy Qur'an into English (originally in 1917; see Ali,
2002). In addition, Ali published another lengthy book entitled

The Religion of Islam

(originally in 1936;

see Ali, 1990).
Many Americans believe that Muslims have a religious duty to wage

jihad, a holy war, on all people

who do not follow Islam and put their faith in Allah. This belief is mistaken. First, the word jihad is not
synonymous with war, but rather it means to

exert

oneself, or to have the

ability

to resist one's enemies.

The enemies that must be resisted include the devil and one's self (our weaknesses and our ignorance, which
keep us from the path toward truth). This striving for the truth is reected, of course, in the verses of the

Holy Qur'an:
And those who strive hard for Us, We shall certainly guide them in
Our ways. And Allah is surely with the doers of good.

Chpt. 29:69; Holy Qur'an (Ali, 2002)
What might come as a surprise to many Christians is that this internal battle between oneself and evil is
by no means unique to Muslims. In Christianity the same need to strive for God exists, and the word used to
describe this striving is

ascesis, a word with essentially the same meaning as jihad (Clement, 1993). In St.

Paul's letter to the Ephesians he tells them to put on the armor of God and do battle with the devil. As for
whom this striving is valuable, even Jesus makes it clear that one does

not

have to be Jewish or Christian.

In a passage quite similar to the quote above from the Qur'an:
John said to him, Teacher, we saw a man casting out demons in your name, and we forbade him because
he was not following us.
But Jesus said, Do not forbid him, for no one who does a mighty work in my name will be able soon
after to speak evil of me. For he that is not against us is for us. For truly I say to you, whoever gives you a
cup of water to drink because you bear the name of Christ, will by no means lose his reward.

Mark 6:38-41; Holy Bible
There are times, nonetheless, when one must ght in order to defend oneself.

When this occurs, the

Qur'an makes it clear that Muslims should prepare to accept peace when it is possible to do so:
And if they incline to peace, incline thou also to it, and trust in Allah.
Surely He is the Hearer, the Knower.

Chpt. 8:61; Holy Qur'an
So if the Islamic and Christian faiths are not so dierent, and both are supposed to seek peace, why have
we become so deeply involved with repeated military conicts in the Middle East? The problem may simply
lie with democracy, and our belief that it should be the basis for all government. In America we purport to
believe in separation of church and state, though the reality of this is quite debatable. In Islam, however,
every aspect of one's life must involve submission to Allah's will. Thus, any attempt to spread democracy

358

to Islamic countries, particularly with the American emphasis on separation of church and state, is an act
of war against Islam (Shedinger, 2004; see also Esack, 1999; Moghaddam, 2006). No matter how much we
might want to disagree with this perspective, if it

is

their perspective, then we are the aggressors, and they

are justied, according to the Qur'an, in ghting back. We believe that we are ghting back, and so the
vicious circle of politics continues.
However, there are those who believe that democracy is inevitable in Islamic societies.

The critical

dierence is that they will be pluralistic democracies, not the secular democracy of America (Aslan, 2005,
2006; see also Manji, 2003). The Qur'an makes it clear that There is no compulsion in religion. . . (Chpt.
2:256;

Holy Qur'an).

Thus, the key to peace in the Middle East may lie in learning to understand one

another, and in accepting the guidance of Yahweh, God, Christ, Allah, or whatever name you prefer for the
Deity. The mystics sought to avoid the politics of the world, and to place themselves entirely within the
presence of God.

Susm
Keep your hands busy with your duties in this world,
and your heart busy with God.

Sheikh Muzaer (pg. 35; in Fadiman & Frager, 1997)
This simple expression of the Su way demonstrates how one can seek Allah while remaining actively
engaged in life, allowing for continued spiritual growth and opportunities to practice awareness, generosity,
nonattachment, and love (Fadiman & Frager, 1997). The beginning of Susm, as with the other mystical
approaches, is somewhat shrouded in mystery. Since Islam is a continuation of the monotheistic religion of
Judaism and Christianity, the Judaic and Christian mystics might be viewed as early Sus. Susm in its
proper sense, however, exists within Islam. When the prophet Muhammad died, there was conict between
the primarily Arab and the primarily non-Arab followers of Islam. The primarily Arab Muslims emphasized
the teachings of Muhammad's colleagues, and became known as

sunni, whereas the primarily non-Arab
shi'ah. These two groups drifted apart,

Muslims followed Ali, the son of Muhammad, and became known as

and their disagreements became serious, to say the least (Nurbakhsh, 1990). Those sociopolitical dierences
continue today, and provide much of the basis for the continuing violence in the Middle East. However, a
third group also arose, a group that ignored the sociopolitical arguments of the sunni and shi'ah, and focused
instead on inner prayer and devotion to Allah. These were the rst Sus.
Practice and understanding in Susm goes through four stages, with each one building upon the others:
understanding the teachings of Islam, practicing Susm by making the teachings part of one's everyday life,
discovering the Truth (or realizing the inner meaning of the teachings and practices), and nally, having the
deep level of inner knowing, or superior wisdom, that transcends the Truth. The great Sheikh Ibn El-Arabi
has described these stages as a progression from yours and mine through mine is yours and yours is mine
and then there is no mine and no yours, and nally there is no me and no you (Fadiman & Frager,
1997; see also Shah, 1971). This perspective is reminiscent of a combination of Kohlberg's stages of moral
development (Kohlberg, 1963) and Eastern perspectives on nonattachment and selessness.
Similar to Christianity, Susm considers love to be of utmost importance in transforming the self. As
we pursue a path of love in our lives, God begins to reach out and draw us in toward the divine presence.
If we are willing to surrender to God, we will awaken and be taken in by Him. To assist with this loving
pursuit of God, a number of great Su teachers have also been poets.

Most notable among these Su

teachers are Jalaluddin Rumi and Omar Khayyam (see Fadiman & Frager, 1997; Hall, 1975; Khan, 1999;
Shah, 1971; Yogananda, 1994). In addition to his poetry, Rumi is recognized as the founder of the Order
of the

Whirling Dervishes. The whirling dance that distinguishes this group of Sus is intended to help

the Dervish achieve religious ecstasy, and it is far more ritualized than might be apparent at rst sight. As
strange as such a practice may seem in the Western world, the practice was apparently used on at least
one occasion by the renowned St.

Francis of Assisi, who lived at the same time as Rumi (Shah, 1971).

Omar Kayyam is most famous for a collection of verses known as

The Rubaiyat

(see Yogananda, 1994).

This strange and deeply symbolic poem almost dees interpretation, particularly for those raised in the
Western world, unfamiliar with Su mysticism. The renowned Indian guru Paramahansa Yogananda, who
also made an extensive study of the relationship between Christian gospel and Yoga (Yogananda, 2004a,b),

359

has provided a marvelous interpretation of

The Rubaiyat.

For example, consider verse VII:

Come, ll the Cup, and in the Fire of Spring
The Winter Garment of Repentance ing:
The Bird of Time has but a little way
To y - and Lo! the Bird is on the Wing.

Translation by Edward Fitzgerald, reprinted in Yogananda, 1994
In this verse, ll the cup refers to lling one's consciousness (as one does during meditation), in the
warmth of spiritual enthusiasm (the re of spring ). One should set aside regret caused by unfullled desires
and disillusioning sensory indulgences (the winter garment of repentance ing ). The bird of time represents
eeting, ever-changing human life, and it is ying away, leaving little time to establish purpose in one's life.
In other words, don't waste your life worrying about, or punishing yourself for, either the past or your own
shortcomings. Life is short, and there is a great spiritual truth to be discovered!
As with the Christian mystics, there have been many well-known Su women, including a number of
Black women (Nurbakhsh, 1990).

The following is an amusing story that both teaches a Su lesson and

demonstrates that a woman can be every bit as faith-lled and wise as any man:
Maymuna was reputed to be her brother's equal in asceticism, piety and reliance on God. Ahmad Ebn
Salem recounts the story of a man who went to see Ebrahim Khawass. When he knocked on the door, he
was met by Maymanu, Ebrahim's sister, who asked his name and what he wanted. He introduced himself
and asked for Ebrahim Khawass.
He has gone out, she told him.
When will he return?
Maymuna replied, How can someone who has surrendered his life to another know when he is returning?
(pg. 182; Nurbakhsh, 1990)

Discussion Question: What impression have you had of the whirling dervishes? Can you think of any
religious groups within Christianity that demonstration such fervent, physical worship in their churches?
What eect might this have on the sense of community within the church?

Connections Between Mystical and Eastern Perspectives
One of the most pleasing aspects of studying Yoga, Buddhism, Kabbalah, Christian mysticism, and
Susm is the recognition that all of these spiritual approaches to life respect one another. An examination
of the works of many authors, representing each of these mystical approaches, suggests that there is but one
God of the mystics (Armstrong, 1993). Su, Kabbalistic, and Zen practices often seem quite similar, as do
select Hindu, Yogic, Buddhist, Judaic, Taoist, and Christian teachings (Holy Bible; Khan, 1999; Lao Tsu,
c.

600 B.C./1989; Mitchell, 2000; Walker, 2003).

Renowned Buddhist teachers, such as His Holiness the

Dalai Lama (1996) and Thich Nhat Hahn (1995, 1999), have oered extensive comparisons of Buddhism to
Christianity, as Paramahansa Yogananda has compared Yoga to Christianity (Yogananda, 2004a,b). Two of
Fr. Laurence Freeman's books on Christian mysticism have forewords written by the Dalai Lama and Sir
Yehudi Menuhin. Menuhin, who was Jewish, was also a personal friend of the guru B. K. S. Iyengar, and
wrote the foreword for one of his books (Iyengar, 1966). Fr. Freeman has written an introduction for one of
the Dalai Lama's books. Fr. Thomas Merton was friends with D. T. Suzuki, wrote

Mystics & Zen Masters

(Merton, 1967), traveled extensively throughout the Far East (Burton, Hart, & Laughlin, 1973), and the
Dalai Lama praised Merton as having a more profound understanding of Buddhism than any other Christian
he had known.

In addition, Merton had a keen interest in Susm, and taught a course on it, though he

claimed not to understand it very well (Baker & Henry, 2005).
Similar to the importance of a guru, Sus also emphasize the importance of a teacher, or

sheikh. The

sheikh must be someone who practices what they preach, in order to be an example for their students. A
Su sheikh understands not only the complexity of Susm, but also the complexity of the individual seeking
Allah. In Susm there are no self-appointed sheikhs, and all orders can trace their heritage to the prophet
Muhammad (Fadiman & Frager, 1997). In Judaism, a priest is typically called

Rabbi, which means teacher,

and Jesus was often called Rabbi as well. Rabbis often believed that the whole of Israel (as in the Jewish
people), were called to be Rabbis (Armstrong, 1993), and most Christians have heard that they are all called
to be

evangelists, or those who teach the faith and try to convert others to Christianity. As confusing as

the mystical approach to the Deity can be, it should hardly be surprising that mystics believe in the need for
a teacher to help others understand this path. When it is done sincerely, for those who are indeed seeking
the Deity, it is a wonderful gift to be able to give, and even more so to be able to receive.

Discussion Question: Does the fact that mystics from so many dierent faiths can come together and
share their faith oer hope to the future of humanity? Or will human nature always be a source of prejudice,
discrimination, conict, and war? If religion and/or spirituality cannot help, can psychology surpass them
in the service of peace and contentment?

A Final Thought
One of the great challenges facing the world today, as it has been for thousands of years, is the belief that
one religion is

right,

and all others are

wrong.

A Jesuit priest named Fr. Anthony de Mello, SJ (1931-1987),

who lived in Poona, India, compared Christian contemplative prayer to a variety of Eastern practices, and
wrote marvelous stories to convey this message of diversity (de Mello, 1978, 1982, 1990). The following story,
from

The Song of the Bird,

exemplies the folly of insisting upon a single religion being the only way to

God:
A Christian once visited a Zen master and said, Allow me to read you some sentences from the Sermon
on the Mount. I shall listen to them with pleasure, said the master. The Christian read a few sentences
and looked up. The master smiled and said, Whoever said those words was truly enlightened. This pleased
the Christian. He read on. The master interrupted and said, Those words come from a savior of mankind.
The Christian was thrilled.

He continued to read to the end.

pronounced by someone who was radiant with divinity.

The master then said, That sermon was

The Christian's joy knew no bounds.

He left,

determined to return and persuade the master to become a Christian.
On the way back home he found Jesus standing by the roadside. Lord, he said enthusiastically, I got
that man to confess that you are divine! Jesus smiled and said, And what good did it do you except to
inate your Christian ego?
Unfortunately, Fr. de Mello's writings led to him being censured by the Roman Catholic Church. Regardless, Fr. de Mello continued to consider the Catholic Church his spiritual home, and he dedicated

Song of the Bird

The

to the church. Clearly, he believed and practiced what he was teaching to others.

Personality Theory in Real Life: Completing the
Personality Theory Journey
At the end of Chapter 1 you were given an exercise to explore who you think you are, and whether other
people see you as you see yourself. In the various chapters of this book, you have been introduced to many
dierent ways of viewing personality and its development. You have probably been able to see elements of
each major perspective in your own personality, which can make it dicult to think of one theory as being
the right one. In these nal chapters, you have been introduced to mystical approaches that suggest that
there is no real personality or ego; it is an illusion, which separates us from the reality that we have within
us an essence of divinity, a soul if you will. In order to help us realize our soul, and to be one with the divine
reality, these mystical approaches suggest paths for personal development designed to help be at peace with
who we are, and with our place in the universe.
So, have you ever contemplated, or have you practiced, actively developing your personality in a way
that will lead to contentment in your life and peaceful, friendly relationships with other people? If you have,
was your religious faith an essential element, and do you think that such a spiritual approach can also be
eective if done humanistically by people who are atheists? And now the big question: Do you believe this
topic belongs in the eld of psychology, or should it only be considered by theologians and philosophers?
As before, there is no right or wrong answer to this last question.

The mystics emphasized that the

divine is divine, and the physical world is the world in which we live.

Sometimes the two come together

without conict, but other times the conict that arises from religious/political dierences leads to terrible
tragedies. Consider this: you have not completed your personality journey, despite the title of this section.
Your life continues, your education continues, and you have signicant control over the direction that both
of those endeavors follow. How does that make you and your classmates feel?

15.1 Review of Key Points
•

The Abrahamic religions include over 3.5 billion people around the world. Thus, they are an essential
cultural consideration when examining the factors that inuence personality.

•
•

Judaism oers a simple set of guidelines for living one's life, known as the Ten Commandments.
Kabbalah is the mystical form of Judaism, which emphasizes blending one's daily, worldly life with
one's spiritual life.

•

Kabbalists encourage a way of incorporating the Ten Commandments into one's life, in a manner
reminiscent of Buddhist mindfulness. The meaningless alternative is to simply view the commandments
as a static set of rules to be obeyed.

•

Kabbalah, as an approach to the problems of daily life, compares favorably with cognitive psychotherapy.

•

Past-life therapy relies on accepting the Kabbalistic belief in reincarnation, and using that knowledge
to help people reconnect with their past lives.

•
•
•

Christianity is the largest religion in the world, with over 2.2 billion followers.
Jesus simplied the Ten Commandments to just two: love God, and love your neighbor as yourself.
The early Christian mystics were desert hermits, who helped to establish both Christian mysticism
and the monastic life.

•

In Christian mysticism there have been many inuential women saints, including some who challenged
the patriarchal attitudes of men and one who became a great military leader (St. Joan of Arc).

•

Fr.

John Main, and his student Fr.

Laurence Freeman, have actively worked to help bring simple

Christian meditation techniques to people all around the world.

•
•
•

Islam is the world's second largest religion, with over 1.5 billion followers.
Muslims follow a set of guidelines known as the Five Pillars of Islam.
Susm arose amongst those Muslims who did not wish to be drawn into the political and social battles
that continue today between the sunni and shi'ah. Instead, Sus seek to be drawn into Allah.

•

Susm has developed some most interesting practices, including sheikhs who became renowned poets
and the whirling dervishes.

•

In contrast to the conicts between organized religions, and their supposed followers, there is extraordinary peace and both spiritual and intellectual interaction between mystics of many paths (Hindu,
Taoist, Jewish, Christian, Muslim, etc.).

•

Mystics recognize the diculty that often arises in the form of confusion regarding their ways. Accordingly, they routinely emphasize the need for a teacher (guru, rabbi, sheikh, master, etc.) for those
who wish to pursue a mystic path.

•

Jihad is neither a holy war nor a requirement of Muslims. It is an urging to strive for faith, especially
in the presence of those who are unfaithful. Christianity shares the same element, and it is known as
ascesis.

African Perspective on Personality

To suggest that there is such a thing as an African personality may be misleading.

Africa is the second

largest continent, with just over 1 billion people spread out among over fty dierent countries.

It has

been the target of extensive colonization over the centuries, and the struggle for liberation from European
countries has surely left an indelible mark on the nature of the people there. In addition, the Sahara Desert

North
Africa are primarily Arab-Berber Muslims, with ready access to southern Europe across the Mediterranean
creates a signicant natural division of the people in the north from those in the south. The people of

Sea. This region can rightly be viewed as an extension of Western Asia, in terms of culture, spirituality,
and race/ethnicity (Chatterji, 1960; Senghor, 1971). In contrast, the Black Africans live south of the Sahara
Desert, and they are the people usually referred to when we think about Africans. Indeed, for the remainder
of this section I will use the term African to refer to Blacks living in

Sub-Saharan Africa. Though many

people in Africa identity themselves in terms of their unique ethnicity, history, and geography, this book
would be incomplete if

no

eort was made to address the people of this continent. Keep in mind, however,

that there is a great deal more work to do regarding our understanding of indigenous people around the
entire world.
In 1999, James Lassiter wrote a very helpful article covering many of the historical problems that have
aected the study of personality in Africa.

Unfortunately, many studies sought to identify the nature

of personality among Africans in terms of Western ideals, values, and socioeconomic and technological
advancement.

This biased view created a very negative attitude toward the people of Africa, a negative

attitude that the people of Africa often adopted themselves. Thus, the study of personality fell into disrepute,
and largely came to a halt.

However, a number of professionals from other disciplines, such as sociology

and anthropology, continued to examine whether or not there were characteristics common to the people of
Africa, a unique and valuable personality distinct from other regions of the world. Though some controversy
remains, and the denitions of what personality is from an African perspective are quite dierent than
those we might recognize in traditional Western psychology, this work has led to some interesting insights.
Fundamentally, these perspectives are summarized by the following simple proverb:

Umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu

(a person is a person through other persons)

- Xhosa proverb (cited in Lassiter, 1999 and Tutu, 1999)

The African Worldview and Spirituality
For many authors, a common African personality derives from a common African

worldview.

According to Khoapa (1980), an African's existential reality is one of collective being, they seek to understand the world through their intersection with all aspects of the world and other people. This worldview is
holistic and humanistic, and it focuses on interdependence, collective survival, harmony, an important role
for the aged, the oral tradition, continuity of life, and rhythm. In addition, there is a fundamental belief
in a metaphysical connection between all that exists within the universe, through an all-pervasive energy or
 spirit that is the essence of all things (Chatterji, 1960; Grills, 2002; Grills & Ajei, 2002; Khoapa, 1980;

Mwikamba, 2005; Myers, 1988; Obasi, 2002; Parham et al., 1999; Senghor, 1965, 1971; Sofola, 1973).
At the center of the African worldview is spirit, or life itself, a vital force that animates the universe
and that imparts

feeling

to all things from God down to the smallest grain of sand. Although this spirit

pervades all things, there is a distinct hierarchy among the things that make up the universe. At the top
of the hierarchy is God, followed by the ancestors (including the founders of the tribes, aka the god-like
ones) and the living. Then come the animals, plants, and minerals. Being in the center, humans hold a

being (using this term in the same
spiritness within each person, is divine, and

privileged position. As living beings, people are able to increase their
context as in existentialism). The source of spirit, and the

transcends both the physical universe and time. Thus, it can connect us to any person, place, or thing. This
is part of the basis for African veneration of their ancestors. In order for the ancestors to avoid becoming
completely dead, they must devote themselves to strengthening the lives of the living. As a result, they
can still participate in life. When a person recognizes that through spirit all things become one, and if they
adhere to this realization, they lose all sense of individual ego/mind. Instead, they experience the harmony
of collective identity and a sense of extended self that includes ancestors, those not yet born, all nature, and
their entire community (Busia, 1972; Grills, 2002; Grills & Ajei, 2002; Jahn, 1972; Myers, 1988; Obasi, 2002;
Parham, 2002; Parham et al., 1999; Senghor, 1965).
Based on the previous paragraph, it should be clear that religion and spirituality are very important to
Africans. We share a biological connection with animals, and an inherent spiritual connection with plants
and minerals, but our privileged position at the junction of spirit and nature allows us to participate in a
spiritual life that separates us from the animals, plants, and minerals. This is how Africans believe they are
able to increase their being. According to Khoapa (1980), we link the universe with God, we awaken it, we
speak to it, listen to it, and try to create harmony. This leads to a profound connection with the rhythm
of the universe. Senghor (1965) describes rhythm as the architecture of being. . .the pure expression of the
life-force. Rhythm has become an important aspect of African life, particularly in art, music, and poetry
(also see Busia, 1972; Chatterji, 1960; Jahn, 1972; Mwikamba, 2005; Senghor, 1971; Sofola, 1973).
African music, like sculpture, is rooted in the nourishing earth, it is laden with rhythm, sounds and
noises of the earth. This does not mean that it is descriptive or impressionist. It expresses feelings. (pg. 86;
Senghor, 1965)
As noted above, the transcendent aspect of spirit leads to connections between past, present, and things
that have not yet happened. This has led to a distinct relationship to time, one that diers dramatically
from the Western world. Africans believe there is a rhythmic, cyclical pattern to life set in place by God,
and God knows what is right. This includes the seasons, the rising and setting of the sun, and stages of life
(birth, adolescence, adulthood, old age, and death). Events in the past are typically referred to in terms
of reference points, such as a marriage or a birth. As for the future, in most African languages there is no
word for the distant future, and plans for the near future are once again typically made around events rather
than a specic time on a clock. Accordingly, time is something to be shared with others, there isn't really
any such thing as wasting time. Tribal elders are respected for the wisdom they have accumulated over a
lifetime, and the living dead are kept alive by the tribe's oral historian (Jahn, 1972; Parham et al., 1999;
Sofola, 1973; Tembo, 1980).

Discussion Question: The African worldview focuses on the universe and all the people within it as an
interconnected whole, and seeks harmony and rhythm. Do you see life in a holistic way, do you try to relate
to others as if we are all part of one creation? Do you think the world would be a better place if everyone
tried to relate to others in this way?

Family and Community
For Africans, the basic unit is the

tribe, not the individual. Since the tribe seeks collective survival,

cooperation is valued over competition and individualism. Since close, personal interconnections are so fundamental, aggression toward others is considered an act of aggression against oneself, and the concept of
alienation doesn't exist. This concern for the community is reected in the family structure. For Africans,
family includes parents, children, brothers, sisters, cousins, aunts, uncles, etc. All relatives have the responsibility to care for one another, and when parents become old it is the responsibility of their children to care
for them (Khoapa, 1980; Kithinji, 2005; Lambo, 1972; Parham et al., 1999).

365

According to Khoapa (1980), Westerners are surprised when they observe Africans in normal conversation.
There is a great deal of spontaneity, laughter, and the conversation goes on and on. They do not wait to
be introduced before engaging in conversation. No reason is necessary for someone to drop by and engage
in a conversation. Every gathering is an extension of the family, so there is no reason for inhibiting one's
behavior. Simply being together is reason enough to engage others. Khoapa suggests that the deafening
silence observed when traveling in the Western world is very strange and confusing to Africans.
The cultural institution of marriage provides an interesting example of these principles in action. Marriage
is a unifying link in the rhythm of life: past, present, and future generations are all represented. Having
children is an obligation, and marriage provides the accepted opportunity to fulll that obligation. Indeed,
since the purpose of marriage is to have children, a marriage is not considered complete until children have
been born (Khoapa, 1980; Kithinji, 2005; Lambo, 1972; Parham et al., 1999; Wanjohi, 2005).

Marriages

can also be a profound source of connection between people that goes far beyond the basic family unit
(two parents and their children). The spirit that underlies and provides energy for the fulllment of being
experienced in a family unites that family with other families around the world. In a more practical sense,
when a man and a woman from dierent tribes are married, the members of each tribe see themselves as all
becoming one extended family through that marriage (Parham, et al., 1999; Samkange & Samkange, 1980).
The belief that we are all interconnected extends beyond one's family and tribe to all people.

Hospitality

is an important characteristic that Africans expect will be extended to all visitors, including strangers.
Dierent than in the West, however, is the expectation that hospitality will precede asking any questions.
Thus, when a visitor is met at the door, they will be invited in, oered something to eat and/or drink, and
friendly conversation may ensue, all before asking anything about the visit or even who the person is (if they
aren't known). Being benevolent to everyone is seen as a sign of good character or good reputation. African
myth and folklore often includes stories about gods or spirits who travel in disguise, rewarding people in
kind for how the god or spirit is treated. Selshness does not promote the well being of the tribe, so a selsh
person is likely to be held in contempt and stigmatized. The responsibility for becoming caring people begins
with the family (Kithinji, 2005; Lambo, 1972; Sofola, 1973).
Every Yoruba, the stranger inclusive, is expected to demonstrate that he was well brought up by his
parents whose emblem he carries about by the virtue of his existence and former socialisation.

A good

home to the Yoruba African is a place where good training and nurturing in character and good behaviour
including good mode of addressing people are imparted to the young. . .The good child is supposed not only
to accept and show good character in the home but should show the glory of the home outside through his
own good behaviour. . . (pp. 97-98; Sofola, 1973)

Discussion Question: In African culture, marriage and family are very important. How important are
they to you? How has your personal history aected your feelings about marriage and family?

Ubuntu
The traditional African concept of

ubuntu is one that encompasses the best that the people of Africa

have to oer in terms of social harmony.

It has come into play several times during dicult periods of

nation building as African countries have gained independence and moved toward democracy. Archbishop
Desmond Tutu, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984, served as Chairman of the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission as the nation of South Africa transitioned from Apartheid to democracy. Rather than seeking
revenge and the punishment of those who had supported Apartheid, or attempting to achieve some sort of
national amnesia through blanket amnesty, the South Africans chose a third alternative. Amnesty would be
granted only to those who admitted what had been done in the past. While some were concerned that such
an option would allow crimes to go unpunished, the deep spirit of humanity that is

ubuntu can lead to being

magnanimous and forgiving.

Ubuntu. . .speaks of the very essence of being human. When we

is inextricably bound up, in yours. We belong in a bundle of life. (pg. 31, Tutu, 1999)
Samkange and Samkange (1980) discuss how extensively

ubuntu (aka, hunhu, depending on the language)

is intertwined with life amongst the people of Zimbabwe. It leads to a sense of deep personal relationship with

For example, Black Americans typically have something unique that distinguishes them

from White Americans, something called  soul. According to Samkange and Samkange (1980) soul is long
suering (Oh Lord, have mercy); soul is deep emotion (Help me, Jesus) and soul is a feeling of oneness
with other black people. As a result of the Black American's experience with slavery, we now have soul
food, soul music, and soul brothers.
Discussion Question: It has been suggested that the essence of personality among African people
has given something special to members of the African diaspora known as soul. However, this may be a
characteristic of all dispossessed people. Have you seen examples of this sort of soul? If yes, what was the
experience like, and how did it aect your own views of life?
Although

ubuntu

is uniquely African, the peace and harmony associated with it can be experienced by

all people. According to Archbishop Tutu it is the same spirit that leads to worldwide feelings of compassion
and the outpouring of generosity following a terrible natural disaster, or to the founding of an institution
like the United Nations, and the signing of international charters on the rights of children and woman, or
trying to ban torture, racism, or the use of antipersonnel land mines (Tutu, 1999). Though

ubuntu itself may

belong to Africa, the essence of it is something shared by all dispossessed groups around the world (Mbigi &
Maree, 1995). It embodies a group solidarity that is central to the survival of all poor communities, whether
they are inner city ghettos in the West, or poor rural communities in developing countries. According to
Mbigi and Maree (1995), the key values of

ubuntu

are group solidarity, conformity, compassion, respect,

human dignity, and collective unity. They believe that African organizations need to harness these

ubuntu

values as a dynamic transformative force for the development of African nations and the African people.
Samkange and Samkange share that view:

. . .ubuntuism

permeates and radiates through all facets of our lives, such as religion, politics, economics,

etc. . .Some aspects of

hunhuism

or

ubuntuism

are applicable to the present and future as they were in the

past. . .It is the duty of African scholars to discern and delineate

hunhuism or ubuntuism so that it can, when

applied, provide African solutions to African problems. (pg. 103; Samkange & Samkange, 1980)

Negritude and Nigrescence
Leopold Senghor (1965) has dened

Negritude as the awareness, defence and development of African

cultural values. . .the sum total of the values of the civilization of the African world.
is not a racial phenomenon, but a cultural one, based primarily on cooperation.

For Senghor this

He distinguished this

cooperation from the collectivist idea we typically associate with Asian cultures by focusing more on a
communal perspective. In other words, collectivist cultures may be seen as an aggregate of individuals, but
in the truly communal society, whether in the family, the village, or the tribe, there is a connection from
the center of each person in their heart (see also Grills, 2002; Senghor, 1971). This is what Senghor believes
has always been held in honor in Africa, and it ultimately encourages dialogue with others in Africa (the
White Africans, the Arab-Berbers in North Africa) and beyond, so that we can assure peace and build the
Civilization of the Universal.
Negritude, then, is a part of Africanity. It is made of human warmth. It is democracy quickened by the
sense of communion and brotherhood between men. More deeply, in works of art, which are a people's most
authentic expression of itself, it is sense of image and rhythm, sense of symbol and beauty. (pg. 97; Senghor,
1965)
Abiola Irele has discussed the history of Negritude as a literary and ideological movement among Black,
French-speaking intellectuals in Africa.

It was initially a reaction to, and in opposition to, the colonial

oppression of the African people. As such, it has been criticized by some as its own form of racism (see, e.g.,
Irele, 1981, 2001; Tembo, 1980), or as something unique to intellectuals, as opposed to more common people
in Africa. However, as noted above, Negritude is about culture, not race

per se.

In addition, a small but

nonetheless interesting study by Tembo (1980) provided evidence that scores on an

Scale did not dier based on sex, marital status, having been educated in rural or urban schools, or whether
they wished to pursue higher education in Africa or England. Irele compared Senghor's view of Negritude to
that of the existential philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre. Sartre viewed Negritude as a stage in the development
of Black consciousness, a stage that would be transcended by the ultimate realization of a human society
without racism. In contrast, according to Irele, Senghor's Negritude is an inner state of Black people. It is
a distinctive mode of being, which can be seen in their way of life, and which constitutes their very identity
(Irele, 1981). Irele nds value in the concept of Negritude insofar as it reects a profound engagement of
African minds upon the fundamental question of the African being in history. . .
At a time when Africans are trying to experiment with new ideas and institutions, adapt them to their
needs in the light of their traditional value systems, there is the need for a sustained belief in oneself, and this
belief can be generated and kept alive by an ideology. This has been, and still is, the function of Negritude.
(pg. 86; Ghanaian scholar P. A. V. Ansah, cited in Irele, 1981)
Although the concept of Negritude is not without its critics, if one accepts its premise there are important
implications for people of the Black diaspora (Irele, 2001).

Nigrescence has been described as the process of

converting from Negro to Black, i.e., rejecting the deracination imposed by Whites and embracing traditional
African values and a Black identity (Parham, 2002; Parham et al., 1999; Tembo, 1980).

This process of

searching for one's identity can be very powerful, leading perhaps to a positive self-identity or, at least,
serving as a buer against racism and oppression (Parham & Parham, 2002). For additional information
on the importance of identify formation and the development of negative identity, I refer you back to the
discussion of negative personality development among Black Americans in the chapter on Erik Erikson. But
what triggers this critical search for one's identity?
For people of African descent in places such as the United States, the process of nigrescence seems to
follow four stages:

pre-encounter, encounter, immersion-emersion, and internalization (Parham,

2002; Parham et al., 1999). In the pre-encounter stage, the indivdiual views the world from a White frame
of reference.

They think, act, and behave in ways that devalue and/or deny their Black heritage.

Then,

however, they encounter personal and/or social events that do not t with their view of society. Muhammad
Ali (formerly Cassius Clay) described in vivid and shocking detail how he was refused service at a restaurant
because he was Black, after he had won the Olympic gold medal in boxing and been given the key to the
city by the mayor of Louisville, Kentucky (Ali & Ali, 2004)! The individual then becomes immersed in Black
culture. This can be a psychologically tumultuous time. For some, everything of value must reect some
aspect of Black and/or African heritage. They withdraw from contact with other racial/ethnic groups, and
strong anti-White attitudes and feelings can emerge. Eventually, however, the individual internalizes their
Black identity and becomes more secure. The tension, emotionality, and defensiveness of the previous stage
is replaced with a calm and secure demeanor. The individual becomes more open minded, more ideologically
exible, and although Black values move to and remain at the forefront, there is a general trend toward
being more pluralistic and nonracist, and anti-White attitudes and feelings decline (Parham et al., 1999; see
also Mbalia, 1995).

Some Issues for Modern Africa
In a fascinating book entitled

Education for Self-Reliance, Julius Nyerere (1967) discussed the importance

of building the post-colonial educational system in Tanzania. A fundamental premise, according to Nyerere,
is that the educational system needed to serve the goals of Tanzania (see also Gichuru, 2005; Khoapa, 1980).
Therefore, they had to decide what kind of society they were building.

He said their society was based

on three principles: equality and respect for human dignity, sharing of resources, and work by everyone
and exploitation by none. Interestingly, these principles do not focus on academic content. The successful
community life of the village was more important. Social goals, the common good, and cooperation were all
emphasized over individual achievement. Nyerere considered it particularly important to avoid intellectual
arrogance, so that those who became well educated would not despise those whose skills were non-academic.
Such arrogance has no place in a society of equal citizens (pg. 8; Nyerere, 1967).
The aim of education in Tanzania became one in which students were to realize they were being educated
by the community in order to become intelligent and active members of the community. Since education is
provided at the expense of the community, the community is well within its rights to expect those students

to become leaders and innovators, to make signicantly greater contributions to the community than if
they had not received an education (Bennaars, 2005; Sanyal & Kinunda, 1977). To this end, the training
of teachers places ideology ahead of content.
Tanzanian concept of

ujamaa

Student-teachers are taught: 1) the true of meaning of the

(familyhood and socialism; a basis for planned, self-contained villages), 2) to

be dedicated and capable teachers who understand and care for the children in their charge, and 3) to deepen
the students' general education. Since colonial rulers exploited, humiliated, and ignored the people of Africa
for so long, it was believed that teachers should be of sound mind and sound body. Thus, admission into
a teacher training program requires a good academic background, sound character, physical tness, and a
good all-around background (Mmari, 1979).

Thus, teachers were trained to be good role models for the

development of Tanzania and her people (see also Bennaars, 2005; Mbalia, 1995).

Discussion Question: In post-colonial Africa, some countries trained their teachers to educate children
in being good citizens, and to be role models for how children should live their lives.

Do you agree that

teachers should play such an intentional role in helping to raise children? If not, does it seem that this was
necessary for a time, given the history of colonization in Africa?
Although most of the work covered in this section has been done by writers, anthropologists, and sociologists, is there a role for more formalized personality testing in Africa? While this may not be the ideal
approach for studying personality in African, it would allow us to compare this work with our Western
concepts of personality (which constitutes the large majority of this book). There is preliminary evidence
that the Five-Factor Model applies well when measuring the personality traits of Africans in Zimbabwe and
South Africa (McCrae, 2002; Piedmont et al., 2002). Tembo (1980) developed an African Personality Scale
on which Zambian college freshman did indeed demonstrate pro-African personality views (as opposed to
anti-African personality views that would have indicated negative eects as the result of colonization; see,
however, Mwikamba, 2005). Thomas Parham (2002) has used two personality tests designed to focus more

Racial Identity Attitude Scale (RIAS; which
African Self-Consciousness Scale. The RIAS measures the nigrescence

specically on the concept of an African personality: the
Parham helped develop) and the

construct, whereas the African Self-Consciousness Scale is grounded in Afrocentric theory (closer to the
concept of Negritude). However, Parham has come to the conclusion that both of these tests fall short of
measuring the core elements of what might be a common African personality, particularly spiritness and
the potential biogenetic nature of African people (Parham, 2002). Thus, if this is an appropriate eld of
study, there certainly needs to be further investigation to determine whether Western concepts of personality
assessment apply to the essence of African personality.

A Final Thought
One of the most widely recognized cultural distinctions in psychology today is the dierence between
individualistic, Western cultures and collectivistic, Eastern cultures. In Western societies, such as the United
States of America, the individual not only has the freedom to seek purely personal advancement, it is expected
of them. In contrast, the individual in countries such as China is expected to subordinate their own desires
and ambitions for the good of the family and their community. With regard to a broad view of the African
personality, we nd a middle ground. There is signicant individual freedom, but individuals are expected
to serve their family and community. As a result, the individual also benets from the overall success of
the family and community. Thus, there is an ongoing interplay between the value of the individual and the
values of family and community.
When this system works to its best potential, the results are people who ourish and can be proud of
themselves. In the words of Dr. J. A. Sofola:

. . .the philosophy,

the world-view, values and thought-patterns that form the ingredients or the building-

blocks of the African Personality are live-and-let-live; the emphasis on wholesome human relations; the belief
of the universality of man and communality of the people in the community; the historic sense of the unity of
the human society as consisting of the ancestors, the living and the future generations yet unborn; spiritual
attitude to life and attachment to communal life with communal responsibilities; a keen sense of rhythm;
the conception of man as one roaming spirit in the chain of spirits in the universe. . .This is the personality
which in its expression of an inward peace and stillness maintains an external composure and gait, head and
chin raised high, and with deliberate, calculated dignied steps proclaims to the world: Black is beautiful

and I am black and proud of being so. (pp. 143-144; Sofola, 1973)

Review of Key Points

•

Roughly speaking, African can be divided into two distinct regions: North Africa and sub-Saharan
Africa.

•
•
•

Black Africans are the people of sub-Saharan Africa.
The African worldview focuses on interdependence, rhythm, harmony, and spirit.
Religion and spirituality are very important to Africans, and humans hold a privileged position at the
junction of spirit and nature.

•
•

Time is part of the cyclical rhythm of life, set by God, who knows what is right.
The tribe is the basic unit of life, not the individual. The family includes a broad range of relatives,
and caring for one's family, especially the aged, is an important obligation.

•

Marriage is an important institution, providing a rhythmic link between past, present, and future. A
marriage is only complete when the couple has children.

• Hospitality to all people, including strangers, is expected, and a sign of good character.
• Ubuntu encompasses the social harmony that is valued in African life.
• Among the people of the African diaspora, ubuntu may be seen in action as the soul referred to in soul
food, soul music, and soul brothers.

•

Negritude represents the active claiming of those best elements of a common African personality by
the people of Africa.

•

Nigrescence is the process of converting from Negro to Black among the people of the African diaspora.
It appears to follow four stages: pre-encounter, encounter, immersion-emersion, and internalization.

•

In post-colonial African countries, educational systems were developed based on the ideals of the new
nations. Teachers were trained to embody those ideals.

•

There is some evidence for the usefulness of traditional approaches to studying personality in Africa
with formalized testing. However, signicantly more work needs to be done.

•

Common elements of personality across Africa seem to represent a middle ground between the individualistic personalities seen in the West, and the collectivistic personalities seen in the East.

Learning Theory and Personality
1

Development

While psychodynamic theory was developing in Europe, American psychology was largely under the inuence
of behaviorism. The American psychologist John B. Watson (of Little Albert fame) is considered to be
the father of behaviorism. Although he is not known for addressing issues of personality development, he
did feel it was important for behaviorists to do so. His approach involved reducing personality to smaller
and smaller units of behavior referred to as habit systems, suggesting that personality was very consistent.
Nonetheless, through further conditioning the personality of an individual could change, leading Watson to
make the bold statement that if he was given a dozen healthy infants he could take any one at random and
train him or her for any career, including doctor, lawyer, artist, merchant-chief and yes, even beggar-man
and thief  (cited in Stagner, 1988; see also Lundin, 1979).
As the scientic study of behavior continued, it became common to try determining behavior on the
basis of mathematical models. This work led to an era of grand learning theories, which culminated in the
highly complex models of behavior proposed by Clark Hull (see Bower & Hilgard, 1981).

This research

took the behavioral study of personality in a very dierent direction than psychodynamic theory.

The

direction in which B. F. Skinner took personality theory, however, was so dierent that it became known
as

radical behaviorism. Skinner rejected anything he could not directly observe, so concepts such as

consciousness, thought, reasoning, and the mind, were all considered irrelevant to the study of individuals.
Only the specic behaviors performed by the individual were open to being examined in Skinner's form of
behaviorism.
In contrast, John Dollard and Neal Miller tried to nd some common ground between psychodynamic
theory and learning theory. Dollard was a true generalist, with interests in anthropology and sociology in
addition to psychology. Miller studied with two renowned learning theorists, Edwin Guthrie and Clark Hull,
and was psychoanalyzed by Heinz Hartman in Vienna, while studying in Europe in the 1930s. Together,
Dollard and Miller tried to develop a theory that would encompass psychodynamic theory, learning theory,
and the inuence of sociocultural factors. Their eort to develop what might be called a unied theory of
personality stands in stark contrast to the constraints of radical behaviorism. Most importantly, they set
the stage for the social learning theorists who followed.

17.1 B. F. Skinner and the Behavioral Analysis of Personality Development
Many psychology students nd it dicult to apply the strict principles of radical behaviorism to personality
development. And yet, psychologists generally consider our discipline to be objective and scientic. Thus,

372

it would seem essential that we acknowledge those psychologists who apply a strict scientic approach to
the study of behavior. Skinner represents the extreme conditions under which some psychologists control
the study of behavior, and his contributions to understanding the basic underlying principles of reward and
punishment, and their consequences, rank him among the most inuential psychologists of all time.

A Brief Biography of B. F. Skinner
Burrhus Frederic Skinner was born on March 20, 1904 in Susquehanna, Pennsylvania. He lived there for
18 years, and graduated from the same high school as his mother and father. By his own account he had a
happy childhood, though it was somewhat chaotic in the rough and tumble coal town that was Susquehanna.
Skinner roamed the hillsides, invented and built all sorts of gadgets, and developed a love for the wide variety
of experiences that life has to oer a child living in a warm and stable home. He constantly satised his
curiosity and imagination:
I was always building things.

I built roller-skate scooters, steerable wagons, sleds, and rafts. . .I made

seesaws, merry-go-rounds, and slides. I made slingshots, bows and arrows, blow guns and water pistols. . .and
from a discarded water boiler a steam cannon with which I could shoot plugs of potato and carrot over the
houses of our neighbors. (Skinner, 1970).
Skinner's father, a lawyer, bought many books and maintained a large library in their home. Skinner
enjoyed school and, under the guidance of an inuential teacher named Mary Graves, eventually chose to
major in English Literature in college and then to pursue a career in writing. While still at home, Skinner
played the piano and the saxophone, and during high school he played in a jazz band.

He also became

quite interested in spirituality, particularly under the conicting views of Miss Graves and his grandmother
Skinner. Miss Graves was a devout Christian, who had taught Skinner's Sunday school class, but held fairly
liberal views on the Bible. Grandmother Skinner took a more re-and-brimstone approach, showing Skinner
the burning coals in the stove to make sure he understand the dangers of Hell! Ultimately Skinner came to
his own perspective, and from that point forward he no longer believed in God (Bjork, 1997; Skinner, 1970,
1976).
Skinner attended Hamilton College, where he majored in English and minored in Romance languages.
He felt that he never quite t in at college, largely because he was no good at sports and because Hamilton
College required students to attend daily chapel.

By his senior year, he and his friends became involved

in some serious pranks, ultimately being threatened with not being allowed to graduate. He did graduate,
however, and began a brief attempt at a career as an author. A professor with whom Skinner had taken a
summer course introduced him to the renowned poet Robert Frost. Frost oered to review some of Skinner's
stories, and he sent a favorable reply that greatly encouraged Skinner (the letter is reprinted in Skinner,
1976). However, Skinner had only one success as an author. His father had always hoped Skinner would
practice law with him, and together they published a private book on legal decisions in the ongoing battles
between the coal companies and the unions. Skinner then spent 6 months living a bohemian lifestyle in New
York's Greenwich Village, followed by some time in Paris, France. Ultimately, however, he gave up his career
as an author because he simply had nothing important to say (Bjork, 1997; Skinner, 1970, 1976).
As a child, Skinner had always been interested in the behavior of animals and kept many wild pets. In
high school he was very interested in philosophy, and in college a professor had introduced him to comparative
psychology and Pavlov's work on classical conditioning. He began reading Pavlov and Watson while living
in Greenwich Village, and eventually went to Harvard University to study psychology. At Harvard Skinner
developed the rigorous work schedule that was to become one of his personal hallmarks.

After leaving

Harvard he taught at the University of Minnesota, where, during World War II, he conducted research on
using pigeons as the guidance system for missiles. He then moved on for a brief period as the chairman of the
psychology department at Indiana University. In 1948 he was asked to return to Harvard, where he worked
for the remainder of his career (Bjork, 1997; Skinner, 1970).
Throughout the rest of his career, Skinner attempted to apply aspects of his radical behaviorism to a
variety of issues, including child care, education, and the very nature of society itself. His inuence has been
substantial, particularly with regard for his emphasis on psychology as a science.

However, his views on

scientic methodology and other elds of psychology have been controversial. For example:

I'm not at all impressed by the model builders, the information theory analysts, the systems analysts,
and so on. They still haven't shown me that they can do anything important. (pg. 82; Evans, 1968)
In general, scientic methodology is not an accurate reection of what the scientist really does. . .it doesn't
reect the actual behavior of the scientist. Fortunately for science, scientic method and statistics weren't
formulated until the middle of the nineteenth century. (pg. 89; Evans, 1968)
In Skinner's defense, however, he often felt that his position was misunderstood.

One of the most

important approaches to the study of behavior that he emphasized was to focus on individuals, not on
average measures of behavior that show none of the characteristic individuality of the organism you're
studying (pg.

92; Evans, 1968).

Despite harsh criticism, Skinner did not take attacks on his scientic

perspectives personally. As he described it, he simply reported the facts that arose from his research, and
chose not to debate those who disagreed. One exception, however, was Carl Rogers. On several occasions
he debated Rogers, whom he described as a friend, about the dignity of man and the control of men (Bjork,
1997; Evans, 1968). He also sent a letter to E. L. Thorndike, who described the Law of Eect after studying
cats escaping from puzzle-boxes well before Skinner was born (published in 1898; see Bower & Hilgard,
1981), apologizing for perhaps having failed to give Thorndike proper recognition for establishing the basic
concepts that led to the study of

operant conditioning. Thorndike replied that he was more honored to

have been of service to new scientists than if he were to have received credit for founding a new school of
psychology (Skinner, 1970).
In 1970,

American Psychologist

listed Skinner second only to Freud in his inuence on twentieth-century

psychology, and in 1989 Skinner seemed to express some pride in being cited more often than Freud (Bjork,
1997). Near the end of 1989, however, Skinner was diagnosed with leukemia. He continued to work as best
he could, and expressed no anxiety about his approaching death. In August, 1990 he spoke for 20 minutes
to a standing-room only audience at the annual meeting of the American Psychological Association. Eight
days later he died (Bjork, 1997).

Placing B. F. Skinner in Context: Radical Behaviorism
B. F. Skinner shares at least one thing in common with Sigmund Freud: he provided a target for the
behavioral and cognitive theorists who followed him. Freud, of course, was a target for everyone in psychiatry
and psychology, including Skinner.

Although some might say that Skinner established the experimental

analysis of behavior, as far as personality is concerned, Freud also thought that he was being very scientic
in his studies of human behavior and the human mind. In order to absolutely dene his understanding of
behavioral principles, Skinner rejected anything he could not observe. Although this allowed him to claim
a level of precision never before possible in the study of behavior, it disallowed the study of the mind,
consciousness, thinking, emotion, the very things that most people consider to be the domain of psychology!
It also disallowed doing many types of research on humans, and so Skinner, his students, and his colleagues
focused much of their eort on studying rats and pigeons.
Like Freud before him, Skinner faced his critics and defended his theories. He certainly had solid scientic
data to support his position, but when he went so far as to propose that he could solve the problems of society
(in his novel

Walden Two ), perhaps he was asking for criticism.

Nonetheless, in psychology today, behavioral

and cognitive approaches to understanding mental illness and conducting psychotherapy are popular and
eective. Although behavioral and cognitive theorists incorporate the very things Skinner rejected (emotions,
thought, etc.), they have built upon the unquestioned behavioral principles studied rst by Skinner.

In

addition, the application of many of Skinner's theories, such as reinforcement and punishment, has had a
major inuence on child rearing and education, or at least in our understanding of those processes.
Although Skinner was not the rst behaviorist, that honor goes primarily to John B. Watson (since Pavlov

374

was rst and foremost a physiologist), his name is typically the rst that comes to mind when recognizing
behaviorism as one of three great forces in psychology (the others being psychodynamic and humanistic
psychology).

Thus, Skinner stands with Freud and with Rogers and Maslow as a giant in the history of

psychology.

Scientic Analysis of Behavior and Personality
Late in Skinner's life (in 1988 to be exact), his former graduate student A. Charles Catania had this to
say:
Of all contemporary psychologists, B. F. Skinner is perhaps the most honored and the most maligned,
the most widely recognized and the most misrepresented, the most cited and the most misunderstood. (pg.
3; Catania & Harnad, 1988)
Skinner emphasized, above all else, approaching human behavior scientically. However, he acknowledged
that human behavior is complex, and that our familiarity with it makes it dicult for us to be truly
objective. In addition, he recognized that many people nd it oensive to suggest that human behavior can
be understood and predicted in terms of environmental stimuli and their consequences. Still, Skinner took
the scientic approach very seriously, and he knew that science is about more than just determining a set of
facts or principles. In Science and Human Behavior (Skinner, 1953), Skinner wrote that:
Science is concerned with the general, but the behavior of the individual is necessarily unique. The case
history has a richness and avor which are in decided contrast with general principles. . .A prediction of
what the

average

individual will do is often of little or no value in dealing with a particular individual. . .The

extraordinary complexity of behavior is sometimes held to be an added source of diculty. Even though
behavior may be lawful, it may be too complex to be dealt with in terms of law. (pp. 20-21; Skinner, 1953)
Given this complexity, Skinner focused on

cause and eect relationships in behavior. In common

use, these terms have come to carry a meaning far beyond the original intention. For Skinner, a cause is a
change in an independent variable, whereas an eect is a change in a dependent variable. Skinner argued
that the terms cause and eect say nothing about how a cause leads to an eect, but rather, only that there
is a specic relationship in specic order. If we can discover and analyze the causes, we can predict behavior;
if we can manipulate the causes, then we can control behavior (Skinner, 1953).

By focusing entirely on

observable behavior, Skinner felt that psychologists have an advantage, in that they will not waste time and
eort pursuing either inner psychic forces or external social forces that may not even exist.

Focusing on

actual behavior is simply more direct and practical. Before examining some of the larger implications of this
approach, however, let's review the basic principles of operant conditioning as dened by Skinner.

Discussion Question: Skinner emphasized a scientic approach to the study of behavior, in part,
because individual behavior is so unique.

Understanding what the average person might do may tell us

nothing about a certain individual. However, a science of personality that treats everyone as unique seems
to become hopelessly complex, because we must study everyone individually. Does this really seem like a
scientic approach, and whether it is or not, can it really help us to understand other people?

Principles of Operant Conditioning
Operant conditioning begins with a response, known as an operant, which has some eect in the organism's environment. These responses have consequences that determine whether or not the probability

Reinforcers increase the probability of a given
punishers decrease the probability of a response that precedes them.

of the response will increase or decrease in the future.
response that precedes them, whereas

In common terms we might say that good consequences increase behaviors, or that the behavior is rewarded.
However, Skinner avoids words like reward due to their psychological implications, preferring instead to use
the technical term reinforcer (Holland & Skinner, 1961; Skinner, 1953).
Both reinforcement and punishment come in two forms: positive and negative.

Positive reinforcement

involves the application, or administration, of a favorable consequence to a response. For example, when a
child cleans their room, they receive some money as an allowance. The response of cleaning the room results

Negative reinforcement involves the removal of an
aversive or noxious stimulus. We are commonly told not to scratch itchy bug bites, because we might

get them infected. However, an itch is a very noxious stimulus, and it is not easy to ignore them. When
we nally give in and scratch, the itching goes away (at least for a while). The response of scratching is

375

negatively reinforced by the removal of the noxious stimulus (no more itching). In both of these examples,
the response (the operant of room cleaning or scratching) is followed by a consequence (reinforcement) that
increases the likelihood that we will clean our room or scratch our itchy bug bite.
Punishment can also be positive or negative. If a child misbehaves and is spanked, that is a positive
punishment. In other words, an aversive consequence is applied (the spanking) as a result of the misbehavior. With negative punishment, favorable stimuli are withdrawn. For example, a child who misbehaves
receives a time-out, thus removing them from toys, playmates, snacks, etc.

Other common examples of

a negative punishment are being grounded or losing privileges (such as television or video games).

Once

again, in positive punishment the response (misbehavior) results in the application of an aversive stimulus
(a spanking), whereas in negative punishment the response misbehaving results in the removal of favorable
consequences (loss of privileges). One of the most common mistakes that psychology students make is to
confuse negative reinforcement with punishment.
negative.

This is understandable, because of the use of the word

So it is essential to determine rst whether a consequence is a reinforcer or a punisher. Then

determine whether the reinforcer is positive or negative, or whether the punisher is positive or negative. It
is also generally accepted that punishment is not as eective as reinforcement, and it is more dicult to pre-

discriminative
stimuli, which signal the contingencies that may be in eect at a given time. In other words, the presence
cisely control the cause-eect relationship (Skinner, 1953, 1974, 1987). This is partly due to

or absence of a parent (a discriminative stimulus) may determine whether one will be punished for a given
response (if the cat's away, the mice will play). In addition, the possibility always exists that punishment
can cross the line into abuse (physical and/or emotional). As Skinner noted, science is not just about the
facts, there is always something more. In theory punishment may seem equivalent to reinforcement, but in
practical matters, such as raising children, every situation may require a more detailed analysis.
In order to reliably measure the behavior of animals (typically rats or pigeons) in his laboratory, Skinner

Skinner box (though its technical name is an
operant conditioning chamber). This apparatus allowed for the precise measurement of how subjects
built a special piece of equipment commonly known as a

responded over time under varying conditions, and produced a special measure of behavior known as a

cumulative record. Although continuous reinforcement is certainly eective for increasing behavior, in
most situations we are not reinforced every time we engage in a certain behavior. Skinner identied four basic

schedules of reinforcement, based on variations in the number of responses necessary for reinforcement,
ratio schedules, or the time intervals between making reinforcers available, so-called interval
schedules. Both ratio and interval schedules can be either xed or variable.
so-called

Although the principles of reinforcement may seem relatively straightforward, they can lead to either
complex or odd behavior.
process of

Complex behavior can be developed with operant conditioning through the

shaping. Shaping involves reinforcing chains of behavior in a specic sequence, with each change

being relatively small and, therefore, relatively simple. As a result, complex behavior can be explained in
terms of shaping a series of simple changes in behavior. As Skinner describes it:
Operant conditioning shapes behavior as a sculptor shapes a lump of clay. Although at some point the
sculptor seems to have produced an entirely novel object, we can always follow the process back to the
original undierentiated lump, and we can make the successive stages by which we return to this condition
as small as we wish. At no point does anything emerge which is very dierent from what preceded it. (pg.
91, Skinner, 1953)
Sometimes, however, this process goes awry. When an individual accidentally associates a consequence
with a response, even though no actual relationship existed,

superstitious behavior can result.

For

example, if you provide a few seconds of access to food for a hungry pigeon every 20 seconds, regardless of
what the pigeon is doing at the time, the pigeon will develop some form of food-getting ritual. Since the food
is delivered regardless of what the pigeon does, the ritual that develops is superstitious. The development of
superstition in humans is believed to follow the same principles (Skinner, 1953, 1987). For a straightforward
description of the principles of operant conditioning, and the prime example of how Skinner believed these
principles might be applied to education, see the programmed instruction book entitled

Behavior

never receive positive punishment (e.g., a spanking). Instead, parents should use negative punishment (e.g.,
a timeout) and then redirect their child's behavior in positive ways. How does this compare to how you were
punished, and do you agree that this is

Personality Development

always

true?

Based upon the principles of operant conditioning, Skinner proceeded to address the full range of human
behavior, including personality development, education, language, mental illness and psychotherapy, and
even the nature of society itself.
Skinner believed that the terms self  and personality are simply ways in which we describe the characteristic patterns of behavior engaged in by an individual. Skinner also referred to the self as a functionally
unied system of responses (Skinner, 1953), or at best a repertoire of behavior imparted by an organized
set of contingencies (Skinner, 1974). Skinner acknowledges that critics of the science of behavior claim that
behaviorists neglect the person or the self. However, Skinner claims that the only thing neglected is a vestige
of

animism, which in its crudest form attributes behavior to spirits. If behavior is disruptive, the spirit is

a demon; if behavior is creative, the spirit is a muse or guiding genius (Skinner, 1974). Indeed, Skinner's
arguments describing the self sound quite similar to the Buddhist perspective we will examine later in this
book:
When a man jams his hands into his pockets to keep himself from biting his nails,

whom?

who

is controlling

When he discovers that a sudden mood must be due to a glimpse of an unpleasant person,

discovers

whose

mood to be due to

whose

who

visual response? Is the self which works to facilitate the recall of

a name the same as the self which recalls it? When a thinker teases out an idea, is it the teaser who also
eventually has the idea? (pg. 283; Skinner, 1953)
If the self, or the personality, does not exist, but is instead simply a collection of behavioral attributes
and functions, then it is an irrelevant concept that needs to be discarded.

Skinner did not discount the

value of Freud's explanation of human behavior, since Skinner acknowledged that many sciences take time
to develop. But now that behavioral science was advancing, according to Skinner, it became time to discard
Freudian concepts of an unconscious mind and mental functioning.

Curiously, this is very similar to the

way in which Freud addressed religion: as something that had served its purpose in the course of human
development, but which should now be discarded in favor of the science of psychoanalysis.
Since no two people have exactly the same experiences (not even identical twins, who do share an
identical genetic make-up), each individual is truly unique. When any one of us seems to have an experience
of identity, a feeling of self, it always exists within the unique circumstances of our experiential contingencies,
the reinforcers, punishers, discriminative stimuli, etc. that have determined our behavioral patterns. Thus,
Skinner argues that we do have a unique individuality, but we are not an originating agent, not a self that
decides to act a certain way. Instead, we are a

locus, a point of convergence for genetic and environmental

conditions which have come together and that will determine our next act (Skinner, 1974).

Education
Skinner's theories have direct applications to education, particularly with regard to controlling classroom
behavior and motivating students to learn. Indeed, when looking at the big picture, the challenges facing
educators that Skinner wrote about in the 1970s sound very much like the challenges in education today
(Skinner, 1978).

Teachers are being asked to do more, to address new and dierent material in their

classrooms, and schools face dwindling budgets and rising costs.

A reasonable solution: make education

more ecient.
Skinner's approach to increasing the eciency of teaching was to rely on programmed instruction, either
through teaching machines (see, e.g., Skinner, 1959) or specially designed books (e.g., Holland & Skinner,
1961).

When I was a teaching assistant at Wayne State University in Detroit, we used

Behavior

The Analysis of

by Holland and Skinner for laboratory sections of the learning course. It proved to be both ecient

and eective. Unfortunately, however, programmed instruction is just that, a systematic program, and it
takes up time that might otherwise allow for meaningful and stimulating relationships between professors and
students. Interestingly, one of the strongest trends in higher education today is to shift from lecture-based
classes to learner-centered education. But this is done with the intent of increasing the active participation
of students within the classroom, not to isolate them in programmed instruction.

In defense of Skinner's approach, it is true that his simple teaching machines and books were only a start.
Today we have access to marvelous educational programs on computer, and most of them are anything but
boring. Some of the educational programs available for children are fascinating and fun games, and that may
be wonderful for children. But is the same approach appropriate for college-level students? In time, perhaps,
technology will bring us yet other innovative approaches that combine the best of programmed instruction
and human interaction.

Discussion Question: Skinner proposed that education could be made more ecient and eective
through the use of programmed learning and teaching machines. Have you ever experienced either of these
approaches? Did you feel that you were getting the most out of your education in these situations?

Language
One of the most controversial areas to which Skinner applied his behavioral theories was that of language.
It took Skinner over 20 years to write

Verbal Behavior

(Skinner, 1957), but in the end he presented an analysis

of language in which he argued that even our most complex verbal behavior could be understood in terms
of simple behavioral contingencies. Skinner began by considering whether there is any dierence between
speech and any other behavior.

For example, what is the dierence between using the word water when

asking for a glass of water and using the arm to reach for that glass of water? In looking at the beginnings of
verbal behavior in childhood, Skinner emphasized the simplicity of a young child's early use of single words
to convey meaning far beyond the particular word. For example, when a 2-year old says cookie, they are
asking for, and expecting to receive, a cookie that they cannot get for themselves. Skinner referred to such
simple one word utterances as a

mand, which he said was short for several related concepts: command,

demand, countermand, etc. When the child says cookie, they will then receive one (reinforcement) or they
will not. If it is too close to dinner, or if the child has already been told no, the child may receive a loud
No!

(punishment).

To make a long story short, all complex verbal behavior develops from this simple

beginning, taking its more complex variations from the process of shaping, just like any other behavior.
Perhaps even more controversial, Skinner assigned thought to the role of subaudible speech. In other
words, thinking was nothing more than talking to one's self, or behaving in the roles of both the speaker
and the listener, but doing so without making any sounds out loud. As strange as it may sound to consider
thought as nothing more than another behavior subject to reinforcement or punishment, if one is willing to
accept Skinner's theory on verbal behavior in the rst place, he then makes a compelling argument:

. . .speech

is only a special case of behavior and subaudible speech a further subdivision. The range of

verbal behavior is roughly suggested, in descending order of energy, by shouting, loud talking, quiet talking,
whispering, muttering under one's breath, subaudible speech with detectable muscular action, subaudible
speech of unclear dimensions, and perhaps even the unconscious thinking sometimes inferred in instances
of problem solving. There is no point at which it is protable to draw a line distinguishing thinking from
acting on this continuum. (pg. 438; Skinner, 1957).
There are those, of course, who do not accept Skinner's theory on verbal behavior. The renowned linguist
Noam Chomsky published critical reviews of both

Verbal Behavior

and, later,

Beyond Freedom & Dignity

(Skinner, 1971). Bower and Hilgard (1981) consider Chomsky's critiques to be perhaps the most eective in
challenging Skinner's viewpoint. Chomsky argued that our knowledge of a series of input-output relationships
tells us nothing of behavior in general, but rather we should be examining the internal structure, states, and
organization of the organism that produced these unique input-output relationships (the very concepts that
Skinner rejected). Most importantly, rather than accepting that Skinner had taken an appropriate scientic
approach, Chomsky felt that Skinner had placed unnecessary fetters on the scientic process.

Chomsky

also adopted the cognitive perspective that addresses whether a stimulus in the environment really exists
in isolation from the individual. In other words, is the nature of a stimulus aected by the perception of
the individual (e.g., how might a paranoid person react to a friendly greeting)?

Attempts at supporting

Skinner's view and answering Chomsky's critique have, according to Bower and Hilgard, simply failed to be
eective or persuasive. And so, experimental psycholinguistics has remained with the general disciplines of
linguistics and cognitive psychology, rather than becoming a branch of behavioral learning theory (Bower &
Hilgard, 1981).

CHAPTER 17. LEARNING THEORY AND PERSONALITY DEVELOPMENT

378

Although much of our conditioning takes place during the early years of life, Skinner did not neglect the
later years. However, he addressed issues of aging in a decidedly unscientic way, mostly by describing ways
in which he had personally dealt with the intellectual challenges of aging. Skinner wrote about a variety of
techniques he had found useful in dealing with forgetfulness, fatigue, and a lack of motivation (see Skinner,
1987). More importantly, however, was the need to prepare for old age when young. By preparing for old
age, we can meet its challenges in the best possible health and frame of mind. In

Enjoy Old Age, co-authored

with Dr. Margaret Vaughan, one nds the following advice:
Nevertheless, it is probably easier to be happy when you are young...We do not live in order to be old,
and for young people to expect that the best is yet to be would be a great mistake. But what comes can
be enjoyed if we simply take a little extra thought. (pg. 28; Skinner & Vaughan, 1983)
In this relatively brief book, Skinner and Vaughan recommend a series of practical steps that one might
take: do something about old age, keep in touch with the world, keep in touch with the past, think clearly,
keep busy, have a good day, get along with people, feel better, recognize death as a necessary end, and play
the role of old age with dignity.

An important part of the latter step is to have a sense of humor.

The

realities of old age can be frustrating, but when you can laugh at the lighter side of these challenges, then
everyone around you has the chance to feel better too (Skinner & Vaughan, 1983).
Having addressed the full range of human life, Skinner also addressed the very nature of society itself.
Actually, it was rather early in Skinner's career that he wrote the controversial novel

Walden Two

(Skinner,

1948). And yes, this book was a novel, not a scientic study, though it certainly addresses Skinner's scientic
endeavors.

Walden Two

is about a utopia, a society based entirely on behavioral principles. Similar to the

challenges Skinner faced in his failed attempt at a career as an author, Walden Two was rejected by two
publishers, and it was accepted by Macmillan only when Skinner agreed to also write an introductory
textbook for them.

Few critics were impressed by the book, and it failed to sell for a dozen years.

But

eventually it did sell, and became a well known, if still controversial, book (Skinner, 1978). Skinner himself
has written interesting reections on

Walden Two

and its implications, including a ctional conversation

between one of the characters and the late George Orwell (author of

1984 ;

Skinner, 1978, 1987).

Perhaps the most interesting aspect of Skinner's behavioral, utopian society is that it has not remained ctional. At least two communities have been established based on the ideas presented in

Two.

Walden

The rst, established in 1967, is the Twin Oaks Intentional Community, located in rural Vir-

ginia (www.twinoaks.org).

The second, established in 1973, is Los Horcones, located in Sonora, Mexico

(www.loshorcones.org.mx). Los Horcones has, among its many interesting programs, developed special education programs for developmentally delayed children, particularly those suering from autism. Although
both communities have been successful, they have found it dicult to expand.

Mental Illness and Behavior Therapy
Although the topics of mental illness and behavior therapy are better left to a course in abnormal
psychology, let's take a brief look at some of the more dramatic applications of Skinner's theories to this
important topic. Today, an important trend in psychology is community mental health, in which it is common
for a team of mental health practitioners, including psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, and mental
health nurses, to come together and combine their unique specialties in the treatment of a variety of mental
health issues. Following two conferences in 1953 and 1954, on the development and causes of mental disease,
Skinner wrote that it is important for psychology to maintain a narrow focus, not an interdisciplinary one.
Specically, Skinner believed that psychologists should focus on the signicant properties of mental
disease. He describes the organism (or person) as being under the inuence of hereditary and environmental
inuences, and engaging in behaviors. How we dene these variables depends on our perspective. We can
refer to genetic inuences as instincts or, in humans, as traits and abilities. We can refer to environmental
variables, both past and present, as memories, needs, emotions, perception, etc.

But we do not have to

interpret those factors we cannot observe, and Skinner felt it was not useful to do so (Skinner, 1959).
Skinner did not actually reject the possibility of the existence of a mental apparatus, as described by
Freud, but he did consider it outside the realm of psychological

science.

And as with complex verbal behavior,

Skinner believed that if we could suciently break down the behavioral contingencies that underlie psychotic
behavior, then we would be able to describe its signicant properties in behavioral terms. This analysis may

someday involve a more detailed understanding of what happens in the nervous system (and in the brain),
but that analysis may appropriately belong in psychiatry and/or neurology, not in psychology (Skinner,
1959).
Skinner felt that mental illness centered on issues of control, and the development of abnormal contingencies in the control of behavior. Most people fear control, and Skinner posed the somewhat amusing question:
How often do psychotics have delusions about benevolent controllers?

(pg.

234; Epstein, 1980).

When

faced with being controlled, under excessive conditions, individuals may attempt to escape, revolt, or resist
passively. Given the complexity of human life, these behaviors can take many forms and can result in many
emotional by-products, such as fear, anxiety, anger or rage, or depression (Skinner, 1953). When these conditions become maladaptive or dangerous, a need for psychotherapy arises. Skinner viewed psychotherapy
as yet another form of control, but one in which the therapist creates a non-punishing situation that allows
the patient to address problematic behaviors. The therapist and the patient can then work out programs
that reduce occasions of punishment and increase occasions of reinforcement in the patient's life. As such,
Skinner considered psychotherapy to be somewhat the opposite of religion and governmental agencies, both
of which tend to rely on punitive measures to control the behavior of people (Skinner, 1953).
Through it all, Skinner was optimistic about the future of humanity, and he felt that behaviorism would
help people to achieve their full potential. In this regard, he was similar to Freud, who felt that psychoanalysis
was a fully scientic endeavor, which would also help to advance the development of humanity. The dierence
between these two great scientists of human behavior lies in how this might come about:
An experimental analysis shifts the determination of behavior from autonomous man to the environment
- an environment responsible both for the evolution of the species and for the repertoire acquired by each
member. . .but we must remember that it is an environment largely of his own making. The evolution of a
culture is a gigantic exercise in self-control. . .But no theory changes what it is a theory about; man remains
what he has always been.

And a new theory may change what can be done with its subject matter.

A

scientic view of man oers exciting possibilities. We have not yet seen what man can make of man. (pp.
214-215; Skinner, 1971)

Connections Across Cultures: Personality within Society
John Dollard was one of three theorists whom we will cover in this book who made signicant contributions
to studying racial issues and minority groups. However, unlike Erik Erikson (see Chapter 7) and Gordon
Allport (see Chapter 13), both of whom addressed these issues later in their careers, Dollard (trained in
sociology and anthropology) began these studies before he made his signicant contributions to psychology.
This fact had an important inuence on his later approach to how personality is learned, and the use he
and Miller made of cross-cultural examples in the books they published together. Indeed, as something of a
prelude to his work with Miller, Dollard ends the book

Caste and Class in a Southern Town

(Dollard, 1937)

with the following passage:

. . .It is one of the urgent needs of social psychology to see the life-history problem against the background
of class structure and to get life records from persons who are also described from the sociological standpoint.
(pg. 459; Dollard, 1937)
Dollard made an important distinction between
living in the Southern United States in the 1930s.

class and caste, as it applies to Blacks and Whites
Class generally refers to a group of people of similar

economic and political status, such as lower (or working) class, middle class or upper class.

A caste is a

group dened by some social and/or hereditary factor, such as being ethnically Black or White. There are
lower class Blacks and Whites, and there are middle class Blacks and Whites. However, in our society it
has been the Blacks who were most dramatically oppressed, through the institution of slavery. Thus, Blacks
have been relegated to a lower caste, regardless of whether their economic success qualies them for middle
class status, or even whether they are wealthy. This has had a detrimental inuence on family structure in
the Black community, and with it an important inuence of personality development:
Personality formation must be intelligible in terms of patterns in the family. The study of the family
as a formal unit has been slighted in this research, but some things are known. One is that the lower-class
Negro family diers from the middle-class white family and seems by comparison to be disorganized. This
is undoubtedly a result of the fact that during slavery days it was impossible for Negroes to approximate

white family structure. (pp. 413-414; Dollard, 1937)
Dollard discusses a variety of ways in which White plantation owners worked to eliminate all trace of the
African family structure and culture among their slaves, not the least of which was the dramatic removal of
them from Africa to America. In many ways the slave owners encouraged pleasure-seeking, lack of discipline,
and independence from family. These values helped to keep male slaves somewhat satised in spite of their
conditions, and they encouraged the independence of children so that they might begin working at a young
age (Dollard, 1937). These values slowly established a new culture for Blacks in America, often with negative
consequences. After the Civil War, some Blacks also began to adopt the values of the White culture, but
they were not accepted by many people in America. This conict is what ultimately led the Supreme Court

Brown v. Board Education, to declare that separate is not equal.
Children of Bondage, with a social anthropologist named Allison Davis (Davis

of the United States, in the 1954 ruling
Dollard also co-authored

& Dollard, 1940). Davis was one of the rst Black professors to receive tenure at a university that was not
an historically Black institution (the University of Chicago). He successfully challenged the racial bias in IQ
tests of the past, helping to eliminate their use in the school systems of many cities, and he was recognized by
the U. S. government with a postage stamp in a series that included Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Jackie
Robinson. In their work together, Davis and Dollard focus on describing the personalities and socialization
of eight adolescent Blacks in the deep south. They emphasize the demands placed on these youth by both
their particular caste position and the social class into which they were born. Individuals may attempt to
rebel against their feelings of inferiority with regard to class, and class mobility is possible, but not so with
one's racial identity:
In studying the status controls operating upon an individual one nds that most persons in our society
are disposed to conceal, even from themselves, any inferiority in their social rank. . .Refusal to acknowledge
one's inferior status, and the building of defenses to decrease anxiety on this score are especially complex
with regard to class status. . .Color caste, however, is so clearly and so rigidly dened that persons in the
lower-caste society (as well as the general American reader of this book) will exhibit much less psychological
resistance to the fact of caste status than to that of class position. (pg. 17; Davis & Dollard, 1940)
It was within this context, recognizing caste and class as socializing factors inuencing personality development, that Dollard went on to study learning theories related to personality development:
But what, one may ask, is the practical use of studying these class patterns of behavior? . . .what good
is such knowledge to the student of human nature, and to our society?. . .is it a valuable tool which will help
us to

predict

behavior in any given situation and in the end to change it?

The writers' studies of the class conditioning of Negro children have convinced them. . .that when properly understood the sanctions of the class position, as enforced by the family, the clique, and the larger
class environment, are among the most important controls in the formation of human habits. In order to
understand the powerful grip of this class behavior, we must rst examine the social environment in which
Negro children learn their habits and the specic methods by which this learning is reinforced. (pg. 259;
Davis & Dollard, 1940)
John Dollard and Neal Miller: Psychodynamic Learning Theory
Sigmund Freud felt that only his approach to psychodynamic theory and psychoanalysis would allow
for an understanding of human behavior. B. F. Skinner felt the same way about radical behaviorism. But
very few psychologists have felt so strongly about one, and only one, approach to psychology. John Dollard
and Neal Miller attempted to blend psychodynamic theory with learning theory, and the results were quite
successful. Their theories on the relationship between frustration and aggression, social learning (developed
more fully by Bandura, Rotter, and Mischel, whom we will cover in the next chapter), and conict are
standard topics in introductory psychology textbooks.

Brief Biographies of John Dollard and Neal Miller
John Dollard (1900-1980) and Neal Miller (1909-2002) were born just a few years and a few miles apart
in Wisconsin, though Miller's family soon moved to Washington. Dollard was a generalist, with interests in
psychology, anthropology, and sociology, who conducted important research on racial discrimination in the
American south. Miller was particularly interested in physiological psychology, and his pioneering work on
biofeedback is as famous as anything we will discuss in this chapter. Though pursuing very dierent careers,

their paths crossed at Yale University's Institute of Human Relations.
Dollard received his bachelor's degree from the University of Wisconsin in 1922, and then went to the
University of Chicago, where he earned his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in sociology in 1931.

His interests

at the time were primarily in sociology and anthropology, and he accepted an assistant professorship in
anthropology at Yale University. A year later he became an assistant professor of sociology at Yale's newly
formed Institute of Human Relations. Dollard remained at Yale throughout his career, earning the status
of professor emeritus in 1969.

In addition to his work with Miller, Dollard studied the eects of racial

segregation and discrimination in the southern United States, resulting in two landmark books. Dollard also
traveled to Germany between completing graduate school and beginning his position at Yale. While there,
he studied psychoanalysis and was psychoanalyzed at the Berlin Institute.
Miller received his bachelor's degree from the University of Washington in 1931, where he studied with the
well-known learning theorist Edwin Guthrie. He received an M.A. from Stanford University, and his Ph.D.
from Yale in 1935. While a graduate student at Yale he studied with Clark Hull, one of the most inuential
learning theorists. Like Dollard, Miller traveled to Europe after graduate school, and was psychoanalyzed
at the Vienna Institute for Psychoanalysis (reportedly he could not aord to be analyzed by Freud himself ).
Upon returning, Miller joined the faculty at Yale's Institute of Human Relations. He remained there from
1936 to 1941, and it was during these years that worked closely with Dollard.
During World War II Miller conducted psychological research for the Army Air Force, while Dollard
remained at Yale and studied the eects of combat on fear.

Miller returned to Yale as a professor of

psychology, and remained there until 1966. He then left Yale to establish the Laboratory of Physiological
Psychology at Rockefeller University, where he retired as professor emeritus. Among his many honors, Miller
served as president of the American Psychological Association, he received an award for Outstanding Lifetime
Contribution to Psychology from APA, and he received a National Medal of Science from President Johnson
in 1964.

Placing Dollard and Miller in Context: Learning Theory in Moderation
Dollard and Miller brought important perspectives into the study of learning and personality. Dollard
was a sociologist with strong interests in anthropology.

Miller was trained as a learning theorist with a

future in physiological psychology. Although two such men might seem an unlikely pairing, their combined
perspective opened the door for eclectic approaches to psychology. Both Dollard and Miller had also studied
psychoanalysis. This combination of psychoanalysis, sociology, and learning led to some of the most famous
theories in psychology:

the frustration-aggression hypothesis, social learning, and a theoretical basis for

understanding behavior in conict situations.

These studies laid the foundation for social learning and

cognitive personality theorists.
In addition, Dollard studied cultural eects on personality development, particularly under oppressive
conditions. Once again, his work laid the foundation for an appreciation of cross-cultural studies in psychology. However, despite occasional studies by noted theorists, such as Erik Erikson and Gordon Allport, the
eld of psychology has only recently begun to make a concerted eort to study cross-cultural issues (Sue,
1999). Thus, in some ways, the fulllment of Dollard and Miller's legacy remains to be realized.

Learning Theory and the Inuence of Clark Hull
As mentioned above, Miller was a student of Clark Hull, one of the most inuential learning theorists.
As an example of just how inuential Hull was, ve theorists who advanced his ideas (including Miller,
Orval Mowrer [a co-author on Dollard and Miller's rst book together], and Ernest Hilgard [whose learning
theories text, co-authored with Gordon Bower, is cited in this chapter]) went on to the presidency of the
American Psychological Association and also received distinguished scientic contribution awards from APA
(Stagner, 1988).

Hull's theory is not easy to understand, as it is a complex mathematical model of the

variables impinging upon an organism's behavior. Unlike Skinner, Hull focused on the organism that exists
between the input and output that were the sole focus of radical behaviorists.
According to Hull, the strength of a response (net

response strength; E), or its probability of occurring,
drive (D) and the strength of relevant habits (H), all within the
context of conditioned inhibition (extinction; s Ir ) and the organisms overall level of response inhibition

is determined by the strength of an internal

(e.g., fatigue; Ir ). Hull expressed this relationship by using a formula:

Available for free at Connexions <http://cnx.org/content/col11901/1.1>

CHAPTER 17. LEARNING THEORY AND PERSONALITY DEVELOPMENT

382

E = (H x D) - (s Ir + Ir ).
Hull later modied his theory to take into account non-learning factors, such as the eectiveness of an
evoking stimulus (V) and the incentive motivation of stimuli (K), resulting in the modied formula:
E = H x D x V x K.
For a more detailed discussion of learning theory see

Theories of Learning

by Bower and Hilgard (1981).

Clearly, Hull's consideration of psychological factors, such as the quality of stimuli, their value as motivators,
internal drives and habits, all of which inuence the nature of input-output relationships stands in stark
contrast to Skinner's theories.

It was within this context that Dollard and Miller attempted to blend

learning theory with psychodynamic phenomena.

Discussion Question: Clark Hull proposed a mathematical formula for understanding behavior, based
in part on habit and the incentive of rewards. Look at the formula E = H x D x V x K, and consider whether
you agree that human behavior can be reduced to mathematics.

Dollard and Miller's Psychodynamic Learning Perspective: FrustrationAggression; Social Learning and Imitation; Conict
Dollard and Miller collaborated on three books, in which they attempted to apply Hull's principles of
learning theory to Freudian psychoanalysis:
& Sears, 1939),

Social Learning & Imitation

Frustration and Aggression

(Dollard, Doob, Miller, Mowrer,

(Miller & Dollard, 1941), and

Personality and Psychotherapy

(Dollard & Miller, 1950). Like Hull before them, Dollard and Miller emphasized drives and habits. They
also addressed theoretical dierences in the strength of reinforcers and punishers, and they equated Freud's
concept of displacement to the behavioral concept of generalization. Rather than considering psychoanalysis
and behaviorism as fundamentally opposed, as Skinner had, Dollard and Miller allowed for a synthesis of
these two major schools of psychology. Their vision led to inuential and popular perspectives (Bower &
Hilgard, 1981; Lundin, 1979; Stagner, 1988).
Dollard, Miller, and their colleagues believed that the relationship between

frustration and aggression

is absolute. In other words, aggression is always the result of frustration. Equally true, but not always as
obvious, is the fact that frustration always leads to some form of aggression. While it may appear that some
people very quickly accept situations in which they do not get their own way (i.e., they are frustrated), it
is also true that we learn early in life to restrain our aggressive impulses. Although we may appear to be
successful in not responding to frustration with aggression, this restraint is most likely only temporary. We
may then aggressively respond after some delay, or toward some other target, but there will eventually be an
aggressive response as a result of the initial frustration (Dollard et al., 1939). In addition, such aggression
does not have to involve active responses, since passive-aggressive behavior is all too common. Indeed, a

passive-aggressive personality disorder (identied by Theodore Millon as the negativistic personality
disorder [Millon, 1996; Millon and Grossman, 2005]; see the Appendix) was included in the DSM-IV-TR for
further study, although it did not make it into the DSM-V (American Psychiatric Association, 2000, 2013).
This is an essential contrast to the view of Skinner. Radical behaviorism does not do a very satisfying job of
relating responses and stimuli following long delays, not does it easily address the displacement of aggression.
However, by accepting internal psychological processes, more exible learning theories can incorporate factors
such as memory, reasoning, emotion, etc. into the relationships between us and our environments.
Aggression comes in many forms, and Dollard, Miller, and their colleagues addressed a wide variety
of social factors, including child and adolescent development, criminality, dierences between democracy,
fascism, and communism, and the nature of aggression amongst the Ashanti.
African tribe of people who were considered powerful and warlike.

The Ashanti are a West

Their erceness in intertribal battle

was said to strike terror into their enemies. Based on anthropological records (primarily the writings of a
Captain Rattray), Dollard, Miller, et al. (1939) described a variety of aspects of the Ashanti culture within
the framework of the

frustration-aggression hypothesis. For example, being captured during war was

considered treason, and treason was punishable by death. Thus, it was expected that a warrior would never
surrender, but rather would ght to the death. However, a warrior's primary goal during war was to win,
and then return home to the family and way of life they were ghting for. If it became clear to a warrior
that he was going to lose, his desire to survive should be foremost in his mind. However, surrendering was
punishable by death, so it was not an option. This created profound frustration! The response might then

be an aggressive rejection of the culture that demanded his death, and he might go ahead and surrender (as
often happened). Another shocking example involved the claiming of infants. In Ashanti culture children
were cherished.

For the rst eight days after birth, an infant was kept in very simple conditions, hidden

from any outside observers. Then, after the 8 days, the parents would claim the child in a public ceremony.
The child would be named, dressed in ne clothes, given a special sleeping mat, and brought out into the
community. If the child died during those rst 8 days, while the family was making its preparations for the
celebration, the result was a very painful frustration. Consequently, the custom was to violently abuse the
body, whipping and mutilating it, and nally burying it in the women's latrine! As shocking as this may
seem, it represents an extreme example of the frustration-aggression hypothesis in a culture where aggression
plays an important role.
In a study relating Freud's defense mechanism of displacement to the behavioral concept of generalization,
Miller conducted a study in which rats were trained to strike each other (see Lundin, 1979). Very simply, a
mild electrical shock was applied to the oor of a cage containing two rats, and as soon as the rats bumped
into each other the shock was turned o. The rats quickly learned to strike each other as soon as the electrical
current was turned on. A white, plastic doll was then added to the cage, and when the electrical current was
turned on the rats quickly struck each other. Then, when one of the rats was placed in the cage alone, and
the electrical current was turned on, the rat struck the doll. Whether this is displacement or generalization
depends simply on whether it is dened by a Freudian or a behaviorist, respectively.

Although Dollard,

Miller, et al. dened the frustration-aggression hypothesis as we know it today, they credit Freud with the
most systematic and extensive use of the frustration-aggression hypothesis, which led to Freud's proposal
of the death instinct and its underlying aggressive energy (Dollard, et al., 1939).
In their second book together,

Social Learning & Imitation

(Miller & Dollard, 1941), Miller and Dollard

addressed the roles of culture and society in the learning process:

. . .To understand thoroughly any item of human behavior - either in the social group or in the individual
life - one must know the psychological principles involved in its learning and the social conditions under
which this learning took place. It is not enough to know either principles or conditions of learning; in order
to predict behavior both must be known. The eld of psychology describes learning principles, while the
various social science disciplines describe the conditions. (pg. 1; Miller & Dollard, 1941)
Given Dollard's background in sociology and anthropology, it should not be surprising that they gave
such emphasis to the social conditions surrounding learning. Indeed, in the preface to this book they discuss
the diculty they had communicating with one another, since they each brought very dierent backgrounds
into this combined eort. They then dened learning theory as the study of the circumstances under which
responses and cue stimuli become connected, and they focused their studies on

imitation and copying.

According to Miller and Dollard (1941), there are four essential factors involved in learning: the cue,
the response, drive, and reward.

In simple terms, in the presence of an appropriate signal (the cue), the

person responds with a particular behavior, if there is an adequate reward (based on learning). The entire
process will not take place, however, if the individual does not want a reward (drive). The normal order,
after learning has taken place, would then be: drive

→ cue → response → reward;

when we want something,

and we see a signal that it is available, we try to get it, and are rewarded for our actions. Another important
aspect of social learning is that both drives and rewards can be acquired.

For example, food choices are

highly cultural. Would you enjoy a dinner of grubs, whale blubber, and sheep entrails, followed by a few
crunchy grasshoppers for dessert? And yet, each of these items is commonly eaten in some cultures, so they
must be reinforcers for hungry people there.
As an additional example of the importance of social learning, Dollard and Miller once again turned
to the anthropological literature. The Semang people of the Malay Peninsula are quite dierent than the
Ashanti described above. The Semang are known as excessively shy and timid people. When faced with
hostility they never respond in kind. Instead, they just retreat farther into the jungle. Dollard and Miller
questioned whether this behavior was due to some personality trait or to learning. The Semang often dealt
with the more powerful Malay tribe. The Malay often cheated the Semang, stole their land, and enslaved
some of their people. When the Semang resisted, they were severely punished by the Malay. As a result,
escape behavior among the Semang was rewarded, whereas aggression was severely punished. As this became

engrained within the culture of the Semang, it was no longer necessary for each generation to re-learn these
contingencies, withdrawal and escape became the cultural norm for the Semang people (Dollard & Miller,
1941). To put it in the terms used above, there is a drive for survival. In the presence of aggressive Malays

In perhaps their most inuential book,

(1950) advo-

cated an eclectic approach to psychology. They believed that the ultimate goal is to combine the vitality
of psychoanalysis, the rigor of the natural-science laboratory, and the facts of culture (Dollard & Miller,
1950). They also felt it was important for all psychologists, even experimental psychologists, to understand
psychotherapy, since it provides a window to higher mental life. They proposed that psychiatric clinics are
full of patients showing three common signs: misery, stupidity (in some ways), and neurotic symptoms. Basically, Dollard and Miller believed that

conict produces the misery, that repression produces the stupidity

(perhaps we should say unconsciousness or unaware), and that neurotic symptoms reduce conict. However, neurotic symptoms do not solve conicts, they only mitigate the conict. In order to better understand
these conicts, Dollard and Miller presented a detailed analysis of conict, which became the best-known
portion of their nal book together (Dollard & Miller, 1950).
Psychotherapy may take place in a therapist's oce, but misery and conict can only be relieved in real
life. Dollard and Miller give credit to Freud for making this observation, but there is a distinct dierence
between how Freud viewed conict, as something primarily intrapsychic (between the id, ego, and superego),
and how Dollard and Miller viewed conict, as a choice between opposing options.

Conict arises when

we must make a choice. Some stimuli are rewarding, some are punishing, and some can be both. We tend
to approach a rewarding stimulus, and that tendency grows stronger as we get closer to it. Likewise, we
tend to move away from a punishing stimulus, and our tendency to move away is stronger if we are close
to it.

Two other important dierences, according to Dollard and Miller (1950), are that the strength of

avoidance increases more rapidly as we get closer to punishing stimuli than does the strength of approaching
a rewarding stimulus, and the strength of both varies with their associated drives. These relationships are
easier to understand when viewed graphically.
Three types of conict are most commonly discussed. In

approach-approach conicts, the individual

must make a choice between two rewarding stimuli, such as having ice cream or cookies for dessert. This type
of conict is easily resolved, since one reward is likely to be more inviting (perhaps you haven't had ice cream
for a while). A much more dicult situation is an

approach-avoidance conict. In this situation, from

a distance the rewarding aspect of the stimulus is stronger, so we approach the stimulus. As we approach,
however, the drive to avoid the stimulus grows rapidly, until we move away. For example, when an abusive
parent tries to comfort a child (something an abused child cannot trust), there is a drive to move toward
the parent for comfort (approach) as well as a drive to avoid further abuse (avoidance). Thus, the child may
begin to approach the parent, but as they move closer they become more fearful and anxious, so they back
away. This type of conict can clearly create the sort of misery that Dollard and Miller were writing about.
Finally, we have

avoidance-avoidance conicts, where both of our choices will result in punishment. For

example, if a child has misbehaved, and their parent is going to punish them, the natural response is to run
away.

With young children this situation can be very easy to observe.

However, many parents will then

yell: Don't you dare run away from me! Now the child must choose between being punished (avoidance)
or running away and being punished worse (avoidance). In this situation, the typical response is to freeze,
and make no choice at all. The child may still be punished, but they will not have chosen the punishment.
Addressing the nature of an individual patient and their levels of approach and avoidance in conicting
situations is critical. According to Dollard and Miller, neurotic patients generally have high levels of avoidance. The key here is that these people have become patients. Many people suer, and are urged by their
friends to work on improving their situation. When those individuals have relatively low levels of avoidance
motivation, they may well be successful in taking care of their problems. It is the ones who cannot overcome
their avoidance issues who end up in therapy. Thus, if the therapist attempts to encourage the patient to
approach their feared goals, the therapist will only increase the patient's fear and conict, and the resulting
misery will drive the patient out of therapy (Dollard & Miller, 1950). Instead, the therapist must focus on
reducing the fears that motivated the patient's avoidance in the rst place.

Overall, Dollard and Miller emphasized that psychotherapists must be well-trained, open-minded, stable
individuals who put the interests of their patients rst.
We have emphasized the precautions important to psychologists who work as psychotherapists. In the
same connection we stress that the ability to treat organic disease does not automatically carry with it a
skill at psychotherapy. Nor does the possession of any degree such as Ph.D. or M.D. routinely confer such
skill. Only the knowledge of theory, the kind of character, and the supervised training discussed here can
make a man a psychotherapist. Anyone who undertakes psychotherapy without such training is exposing his
patient to real danger and committing a moral, if not yet a legal, fraud. (pg. 422; Dollard & Miller, 1950)

Discussion Question: Dollard and Miller described how the Semang culture seems to lack aggression,
as a result of their learning the danger of challenging the Malay. Can you recognize examples in your own
life where a certain group seems to act in a predictable way as the result of how another group acts? If yes,
how has one group reinforced or punished the behavior of the other in consistent ways, in keeping with the
predictable behavioral outcomes?

Psychoanalysis, Behavior Therapy, and Relational Models
Paul Wachtel has continued studying the relationship between psychoanalysis and behavior therapy,
following in the footsteps of Dollard and Miller, and he has also extended this comparison into the relational
world (Wachtel, 1977, 1997). Wachtel emphasized that psychotherapy should be understood in terms of
the theory that guides it, and that the practice of therapy provides the true test of any psychological theory
related to personality and/or mental illness.

Behavior therapy is appealing in terms of being direct and

practical, but Wachtel feels that it can gain in several ways from being blended with psychoanalysis. He
questions whether pure behavior therapists can really assess psychological conditions, whether they achieve
narrow gains at the expense of broader psychological change, and he addresses the ethical implications of
being involved in specically changing another person's behavior. He also addresses several problems that
behaviorists see for psychoanalysis, such as the focus on internal states that cannot be observed, whether
underlying causes are really treated instead of symptoms, and the application of the medical model to
psychological processes.
It is my general premise that psychodynamic and behavioral approaches to psychotherapy, and to the
understanding of personality, are far more compatible than is generally recognized, and that an integration
of the concepts and observations accumulated by these two approaches can greatly enrich our clinical work
and our understanding of human behavior. . .It is my experience that workers guided by either of these two
broad frames of reference tend to have only a rather supercial knowledge (and sometimes none at all) of
the important regularities observed by those guided by the other viewpoint. (pg. 5; Wachtel, 1977)
In

Psychoanalysis, Behavior Therapy, and the Relational World,

Wachtel (1997) discusses advances in

the recognition of object relations theory in American psychology, and how object relations theory ts into
connections between traditional psychodynamic perspectives and learning theory. Although it was not necessarily the intent of object relations theorists, object relations theory has shifted the focus of psychoanalysis
from internal psychological conicts to relationships with other people. Thus, there has been a shift from
an internal focus to an external focus, which is more compatible with learning theory (and the input-output
contingencies that are essential to learning). Wachtel also considers this shift as favorable for connections
between psychoanalysis and family systems approaches to therapy. Surprisingly, Wachtel makes no mention
of relational-cultural theory and the work of the Stone Center Group, which seems ideally suited to the
integration of approaches proposed by Wachtel. Regardless of the nature and extent to which these various
approaches might be integrated, it remains of the utmost importance that the focus of the therapist remains
on helping the patient (Wachtel, 1997).

Cultural Eects on Learning
As shown above, Dollard and Miller regularly incorporated interesting cultural examples in their work
relating learning theory to psychodynamic processes.

Though it may not be obvious, Skinner's radical

behaviorism is as intercultural as any theory. A detailed analysis of environmental inuences on behavior,
including past contingencies and present cues,

must

incorporate an examination of the unique cultural

factors that are part and parcel of those contingencies in dierent cultural groups. In addition, of course,
some psychologists today continue to study relationships between culture and learning.

CHAPTER 17. LEARNING THEORY AND PERSONALITY DEVELOPMENT

386

Tweed and Lehman (2002) compared Western and Chinese learning styles by using two extraordinary
teachers from ancient times as examples of these potentially dierent styles: Confucius and Socrates. Their
article begins with an attempt to address the likely controversy that accompanies such a study.

They

carefully and thoughtfully point out that one can easily misunderstand any contrast between cultures that
are dicult to dene. For example, what does Western mean? Does it really mean European-Americans,
or does that leave out Canadians, Australians, and non-European Westerners? So, Tweed and Lehman prefer
the terms

culturally Western and culturally Chinese, openly admitting that another important issue

is that some Western people may be culturally Chinese and vice versa. They also point out their study was
meant to be descriptive, not judgmental. Having presented such caveats, they proceeded with their study,
and yet received some criticism nonetheless (Gurung, 2003; Li, 2003; see also the response to these critiques
by Tweed & Lehman, 2003).
Tweed and Lehman oer the following generalizations about culturally Western and culturally Chinese
learning:

culturally Western learning focuses on overt and private questioning, expressing personal hy-

potheses, and a desire for self-directed tasks, whereas culturally Chinese learning emphasizes eort-focused
learning, pragmatic orientations, and acceptance of behavior reform as an academic goal (Tweed & Lehman,
2002). In keeping with their non-judgmental attitude, they suggest that these disparate approaches both
have their place in education, and that the ideal situation for students would be one that is academically
bicultural, an environment that oers the opportunity for the strengths of each approach to learning to come
out:

. . .These

students would be in a sense academically bicultural and could operate adaptively within en-

vironments requiring Confucian or Socratic approaches. . .Educators. . .would encourage both thoughtful acquisition (Confucian) and inquiry (Socratic) such that students acquire knowledge and thinking skills that
become fully understood, active, and elicited in many domains beyond the academic context. (pg. 97; Tweed
& Lehman, 2002)
One of the individuals who commented on Tweed and Lehman's article, Jin Li, has focused more directly
on how cultural factors inuence learning itself.

As essential dierence between culturally Western and

culturally Chinese learning is that Socrates proposed that the best learners develop and use their minds to
inquire into the world, whereas the great Chinese tutor Mencius taught that becoming a better, more virtuous
person is the most essential quality for a learner (Li, 2005). This perspective is reminiscent of Wober's study
on intelligence amongst the Baganda people in Africa. They consider intelligence to be something closer to
what we would call wisdom, and their educational system is focused on an individual's ability to succeed by
conforming to the expectations of society, rather than on the ability to solve new and independent problems
(Wober, 1974). Since cultural attitudes and beliefs develop early in life (Ferraro, 2006a; Matsumoto & Juang,
2004), a valuable educational objective would be to emphasize the strengths of each approach to learning as
early as possible in the school years (or even during the preschool years).
In addition to broad-based eects of culture on learning in general, culture also comes into play for many
of the aspects of learning we have examined in this chapter. Henrich et al. (2006) recently demonstrated that
a wide variety of societies are willing to participate in costly punishment in order to encourage cooperation
among groups. In other words, each party to an agreement is motivated to abide by the agreement because
the consequences of breaking it are severe. This study involved fteen dierent cultural groups from Africa,
North America, South America, Asia, and Oceania, suggesting that willingness to cooperate as a function
of severe punishment is universal. Language, which Skinner believed is learned just like any other behavior,
appears to be essential for the development of autobiographical memory, which serves primarily social and
cultural functions and is intimately related to social and cultural development (Fivush & Nelson, 2004).
Presenting an interesting perspective on conict, Eidelson and Eidelson (2003) have identied ve belief
domains that propel groups toward conict. When individuals experience feelings of superiority, injustice,
vulnerability, distrust, or helplessness, there is a good chance they will feel frustrated. When their individuallevel core beliefs parallel the group-level worldview, the situation may trigger or constrain conict or, possibly,
trigger violent struggle (Eidelson & Eidelson, 2003). In such situations, the worldview of the larger group
may be serving as a discriminative stimulus that it is acceptable to act out on one's individual frustration,
since the society in which one lives is likely to reinforce any subsequent aggression (since they share the

individual's frustration). In the next two chapters, we take a closer look at how the social environment and
cognitive processes contribute to the development of our personality.

Personality Theory in Real Life: Positive Reinforcement Keeps Us Behaving!
The presence of positive reinforcement in our lives can be seen in a multitude of ways.

We use it to

encourage our children and train our pets, it is quite common in education, from the earliest grades through
college, and it enters into our lives as adults in many ways. Often the application of reinforcement is not
intentional, we give it out of habit, and partly because it leads to reinforcement for us as well. Although
learning theorists may disagree about the nature of reinforcement, no one can deny it.
There are many ways in which positive reinforcement is given to children.

Infants respond favorably

to attention, and as they coo and smile back, that attention is itself reinforced.

This helps to create an

essential bond between the child and its caregivers. In the case of premature infants, gentle physical contact
(massaging or stroking) by the parents is typically reinforced as a result of the babies gaining weight more
rapidly and being more active (Field, 1993). In other words, caring for an at-risk infant is reinforced, and
thus the caring behavior continues. Infant massage is quite popular in many countries around the world,
and it is part of the total approach to therapy recommended by Wilhelm Reich (Field, 2000, 2001).
As children grow a little older,

secondary reinforcers such as encouraging words (You can do it!) or
primary

clapping are commonly used to reinforce taking rst steps or solving a simple puzzle. Of course,

reinforcers (e.g., crackers or juice) remain very popular as well. Such simple examples of reinforcement
are certainly not unique to humans. Small pieces of food are often used to train dogs, and the reinforced
behavior increases as a result, just like it does with children. While this demonstrates the basic universality
of behavioral principles, it does not suggest that dogs have a personality. However, if you were to ask most
pet owners, they will tell you that their animals do have personalities. And junk yard dogs don't become
vicious as a result of being treated with loving kindness.
In educational settings, positive reinforcement is used quite intentionally, and can be a lot of fun with
young children. Teachers can use a wide variety of stars, smiley face stickers, student of the week awards,
and other little treats that children nd very rewarding. Sometimes children receive good citizen awards
when their teachers observe an occasion of

prosocial behavior (such as helping another child who was

hurt on the playground). Each of these reinforcers is intended to increase those behaviors that are viewed
favorably in the educational environment (completed assignments, good grades, and good citizenship). As
students get older, the reinforcers come less often (as with schedules of reinforcement). Grades are given
out at the end of a term or semester (reinforcing, of course, only if they are good grades). Measures such
as being Valedictorian, in the top 10 of the class, being on the Dean's List in college, or graduating summa
cum laude are the pinnacles of this positive reinforcement hierarchy, yet they depend on long time intervals
(some as long as the typical four years of high school or college).
As adults, our reinforcement often becomes more complicated. Based on Hull's formula H x D x V x
K, consider the eect of being oered chocolate for dessert. After eating dinner, our drive for food should
decrease, and we should not be likely to eat more. However, chocolate is a powerful incentive, so we may
go ahead and eat it even if we are no longer hungry. Skinner's radical behaviorism cannot account for the
phenomenon of eating something we really like when we have already eaten our ll. And yet many of us
have experienced that desire to continue eating something we really like, even after we feel uncomfortably
stued with food! One might also consider Dollard and Miller's frustration-aggression hypothesis, and the
problem many people face when trying to lose weight. It is extremely dicult to stay on a low calorie diet,
especially if we cannot eat the foods we like. Very simply, this is frustrating. According to Dollard and Miller,
frustration always leads to aggression. How might this aggression be manifested? We return to overeating,
even though it is bad for us. In other words, we are harming ourselves and/or rebelling against a culture that
seems to demand being thin in order to be attractive. Interestingly, many diet programs have responded
to this problem (whether or not they understood it this way) by providing either tantalizing recipes or by
oering the food itself in prepackaged form. The hope is that the meals will themselves be reinforcing, thus
eliminating the frustration caused by munching endless amounts of celery and rice cakes. Of course, these
days you can buy quite an interesting variety of avored rice cakes, so even they can be reinforcing for some
people!

17.2 Review of Key Points
•

Skinner emphasized the experimental analysis of human behavior, despite its complexity. He addressed
causes and eects, but was very precise in describing a cause as a change in an independent variable
and an eect as a change in a dependent variable.

•

Reinforcers increase the likelihood of behaviors that precede them; punishers decrease the likelihood
of behaviors that precede them.

•

Positive reinforcement involves giving a reinforcer, negative reinforcement involves removing an aversive
or noxious stimulus.

•
•
•

Positive punishment involves applying a punisher, negative punishment involves removing reinforcers.
Discriminative stimuli signal the behavioral contingencies in eect at a given time.
Skinner automated much of his research, inventing the operant conditioning chamber (aka, the Skinner
box). The data were typically collected in the form a cumulative record.

•

The operant conditioning chamber was designed to control the schedule of reinforcement. These schedules could be either xed or variable, and based on either ratios (number) or intervals (time).

•
•
•

Operant conditioning can lead to complex behavior by shaping the behavior in a series of small steps.
When a subject accidentally forms an inappropriate association, superstitious behavior can result.
Skinner claimed that our typical idea of the person, or the self, is a vestige of animism, the belief that
we are inhabited by spirits. Instead, he believed we are simply a locus for the convergence of genetic
and environmental conditions.

•

According to Skinner, education can be made more ecient by using programmed instruction and
teaching machines.

•
•

Language, according Skinner, begins with the association of simple word elements known as mands.
Skinner believed that behavioral principles could be applied to improve life in old age as well as to
improve society itself.

•

In attempting to address mental illness, Skinner did not rule out the possibility of a disordered mind.
However, he felt that such a construct served no useful purpose in understanding abnormal behavior.
He also believed that mental illness focused on issues of control.

•

Clark Hull, a major inuence on Dollard and Miller, proposed a mathematical model of learning that
included the nature of the mind and experience.

•

Dollard and Miller believed that frustration always led to aggression, and that aggression could always
be traced back to frustration.

They applied their frustration-aggression hypothesis to a variety of

cultural groups.

•

Dollard and Miller began the eld of social learning, with an emphasis on the learning processes of
imitation and copying.

•

When addressing psychological disorders, Dollard and Miller emphasized conict.

They provided

a theoretical basis for understanding approach-approach conicts, approach-avoidance conicts, and
avoidance-avoidance conicts.

•

By incorporating an appreciation for the contribution of object relations theory, Wachtel has advanced
our understanding of how learning theory and psychodynamic theory can be combined in an eclectic
approach to psychotherapy.

•

Tweed and Lehman caution against regional stereotypes when examining cultural aspects of learning.
They propose using the terms culturally Western and, for their particular study, culturally Chinese.

•

Since culture is learned early in life, any attempt to incorporate the best aspects of dierent cultural
approaches to education must begin early.

Social Learning Theory and Personality
1

Development

The social learning theorists observed that the complexity of human behavior cannot easily be explained
by traditional behavioral theories. Bandura recognized that people learn a great deal from watching other
people and seeing the rewards and/or punishments that other people receive. Social learning theorists do
not deny the inuence of reinforcement and punishment, but rather, they suggest that it can be experienced
through observation and does not require direct, personal experience as Skinner would argue. In addition,
observational learning requires cognition, something that radical behaviorists consider outside the realm of
psychological research, since cognition cannot be observed. Bandura took a broad theoretical perspective
on social learning, whereas Rotter and Mischel focused more closely on specic cognitive aspects of social
learning and behavior.
It is also important to point out an articial distinction that is dicult to avoid in the chapters of this
section. Chapters 10, 11, and 12 are roughly set up as chapters on radical behaviorism and formal learning
theory, followed by social learning, and then concluding with cognitive theories on personality development.
However, as will be evident, the chapters overlap a great deal. For example, Dollard and Miller's attempt
to nd a middle ground between Freud and Skinner led to their initial descriptions of social learning, which
provided a prelude to this chapter. Bandura, Rotter, and Mischel address a number of aspects of cognition
in their theories, but they are not as completely focused on cognition as are Kelly, Beck, and Ellis, hence
the separation of this chapter from the following one. In

Social Learning Theory,

Bandura had this to say:

A valid criticism of extreme behaviorism is that, in a vigorous eort to avoid spurious inner causes, it has
neglected determinants of behavior arising from cognitive functioning. . .Because some of the inner causes
invoked by theorists over the years have been ill-founded does not justify excluding all internal determinants
from scientic inquiry. . .such studies reveal that people learn and retain behavior much better by using
cognitive aids that they generate than by reinforced repetitive performance. . .A theory that denies that
thoughts can regulate actions does not lend itself readily to the explanation of complex human behavior.
(pg. 10; Bandura, 1977).

Albert Bandura and Social Learning Theory
Bandura is the most widely recognized individual in the eld of

social learning theory, despite the

facts that Dollard and Miller established the eld and Rotter was beginning to examine cognitive social
learning a few years before Bandura. Nonetheless, Bandura's research has had the most signicant impact,
and the eects of

modeling on aggressive behavior continue to be studied today (see Personality Theory

in Real Life at the end of the chapter). Therefore, we will begin this chapter by examining the basics of
Bandura's social learning perspective.

CHAPTER 18. SOCIAL LEARNING THEORY AND PERSONALITY
DEVELOPMENT

390

Albert Bandura was born in 1925, in the small town of Mundare, in northern Alberta, Canada.

His

parents had emigrated from Eastern Europe (his father from Poland, his mother from the Ukraine), and
eventually saved enough money to buy a farm. Farming in northern Canada was not easy. One of Bandura's
sisters died during a u pandemic, one of his brothers died in a hunting accident, and part of the family
farm was lost during the Great Depression. Nonetheless, the Bandura family persevered, and maintained a
lively and happy home.
Although Bandura's parents lacked any formal education, they stressed its value. Despite having only
one small school in town, which lacked both teachers and academic resources, the town's children developed
a love of learning and most of them attended universities around the world. Following the encouragement
of his parents, Bandura also sought a wide variety of other experiences while he was young.

He worked

in a furniture manufacturing plant, and performed maintenance on the Trans-Alaska highway. The latter
experience, in particular, introduced Bandura to a variety of unusual individuals, and oered a unique
perspective on psychopathology in everyday life.
When Bandura went to the University of British Columbia, he intended to major in biology. However,
he had joined a carpool with engineering and pre-med students who attended classes early in the morning.
Bandura looked for a class to t this schedule, and happened to notice that an introductory psychology
course was oered at that time. Bandura enjoyed the class so much that he changed his major to psychology,
receiving his bachelor's degree in 1949. Bandura then attended graduate school at the University of Iowa,
in a psychology department strongly inuenced by Kenneth Spence, a former student of Clark Hull. Thus,
the psychology program at the University of Iowa was strongly behavioral in its orientation, and they were
well versed in the behavioral research conducted in the psychology department at Yale University.
As we saw in the previous chapter, John Dollard and Neal Miller had established the eld of social
learning at Yale in the 1930s, but they had done so within the conceptual guidelines of Hullian learning
theory. Bandura was not particularly interested in Hull's approach to learning, but he was impressed by
Dollard and Miller's concepts of modeling and imitation. Bandura received his Ph.D. in clinical psychology
in 1952, and then began a postdoctoral position at the Wichita Guidance Center. Bandura was attracted
to this position, in part, because the psychologist in charge was not heavily immersed in the Freudian
psychodynamic approach that was still so prevalent in clinical psychology.
Following his postdoctoral training, Bandura became a member of the faculty at Stanford University,
where he spent the rest of his career. The chairman of Bandura's department had been studying frustration
and aggression, and this inuenced Bandura to begin his own studies on social learning and aggression. This
research revealed the critical role that modeling plays in social learning, and soon resulted in the publication
of

Adolescent Aggression

(co-authored by Richard Walters, Bandura's rst graduate student; Bandura &

Walters, 1959). This line of research also led to the famous Bobo doll studies, which helped to demonstrate
that even young children can learn aggressive behavior by observing models. Bandura then became interested
in self-regulatory behavior in children, and one of the colleagues he collaborated with was Walter Mischel,
whose work we will address later in this chapter. During his long and productive career, Bandura became
more and more interested in the role played by cognition in social learning, eventually renaming his theory
to reect his social cognitive perspective on human learning. He also examined the role of the individual in
inuencing the nature of the environment in which they experience life, and how their own expectations of
self-ecacy aect their willingness to participate in aspects of that life.
Bandura has received numerous honors during his career. Included among them, he has served as president of the American Psychological Association and received a
from APA. He received the

William James Award

Distinguished Scientic Contribution Award

from the American Psychological Society (known today as

Distinguished Contribution Award

the Association for Psychological Science), a Guggenheim Fellowship, the
from the International Society for Research in Aggression, and a

to the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences, and he has received numerous honorary
degrees from universities around the world.

Establishes Its Independence
Although social learning theory has its foundation in the work of Dollard and Miller, they addressed social
learning in the context of Hullian learning theory (complete with mathematical formulae). Bandura shifted
the focus of social learning away from traditional behavioral perspectives, and established social learning as
a theory on its own. Bandura also freely acknowledged cognition in the learning process, something that
earlier behaviorists had actively avoided.

By acknowledging both the external processes of reinforcement

and punishment and the internal cognitive processes that make humans so complex, Bandura provided a
comprehensive theory of personality that has been very inuential.
Although Bandura criticized both operant conditioning and Pavlovian conditioning as being too radical,
he relied on a procedure that came from Pavlovian conditioning research for one of his most inuential
concepts: the use of modeling. The modeling procedure was developed by Mary Cover Jones, a student of
John B. Watson, in her attempts to counter-condition learned phobias. Subsequent to the infamous Little
Albert studies conducted by Watson, Jones used models to interact in a pleasant manner with a rabbit that
test subjects had been conditioned to fear. After a few sessions, the test subjects were no longer afraid of
the rabbit (see Stagner, 1988). This may have been the rst use of behavior therapy, and Bandura's use of
the procedure helped to bring together dierent behavioral disciplines.
Perhaps one of Bandura's most signicant contributions, however, has been the application of his theory to
many forms of media. Congressional committees have debated the inuence of modeling aggression through
violent television programs, movies, and video games. We now have ratings on each of those forms of media,
and yet the debate continues because of the levels of aggression seen in our schools, in particular, and society
in general. Bandura's Bobo doll studies are certainly among of the best known studies in psychology, and
they are also among the most inuential in terms of practical daily applications. The long list of awards
that Bandura has received is a testament to both his inuence on psychology and the respect that inuence
has earned for him.

Reciprocal Determinism
One of the most important aspects of Bandura's view on how personality is learned is that each one
of us is an agent of change, fully participating in our surroundings and inuencing the environmental contingencies that behaviorists believe aect our behavior.
ways.

These interactions can be viewed three dierent

The rst is to consider behavior as a function of the person and the environment.

In this view,

personal dispositions (or traits) and the consequences of our actions (reinforcement or punishment) combine
to cause our behavior. This perspective is closest to the radical behaviorism of Skinner. The second view
considers that personal dispositions and the environment interact, and the result of the interaction causes
our behavior, a view somewhat closer to that of Dollard and Miller. In each of these perspectives, behavior
is caused, or determined, by dispositional and environmental factors, the behavior itself is not a factor in
how that behavior comes about.

However, according to Bandura, social learning theory emphasizes that

behavior, personal factors, and environmental factors are all equal, interlocking determinants of each other.
This concept is referred to as

reciprocal determinism (Bandura, 1973, 1977).

Figure 18.1

Early theories considered behavior to be a function of the person and their environment, or a function of
the interaction between the person and their environment. Bandura believed that behavior itself inuences
both the person and the environment, each of which in turn aects behavior and each other. The result is
a complex interplay of factors known as reciprocal determinism.
Reciprocal determinism can be seen in everyday observations, such as those made by Bandura and others
during their studies of aggression.

For example, approximately 75 percent of the time, hostile behavior

results in unfriendly responses, whereas friendly acts seldom result in such consequences. With little eort,
it becomes easy to recognize individuals who create negative social climates (Bandura, 1973). Thus, while it
may still be true that changing environmental contingencies changes behavior, it is also true that changing
behavior alters the environmental contingencies. This results in a unique perspective on freedom vs. determinism. Usually we think of determinism as something that eliminates or restricts our freedom. However,
Bandura believed that individuals can intentionally act as agents of change within their environment, thus
altering the factors that determine their behavior. In other words, we have the freedom to inuence that
which determines our behavior:

. . .Given

the same environmental constraints, individuals who have many behavioral options and are

adept at regulating their own behavior will experience greater freedom than will individuals whose personal
resources are limited. (pg. 203; Bandura, 1977)

Discussion Question: According to the theory of reciprocal determinism, our behavior interacts with
our environment and our personality variables to inuence our life. Can you think of situations in which your
actions caused a noticeable change in the people or situations around you? Remember that these changes
can be either good or bad.

Observational Learning and Aggression
observational learning, because it comes about as
models. Bandura became interested in social aspects of learning at the beginning

Social learning is also commonly referred to as
a result of observing

of his career. Trained as a clinical psychologist, he began working with juvenile delinquents, a somewhat
outdated term that is essentially a socio-legal description of adolescents who engage in antisocial behavior.
In the 1950s there was already research on the relationships between aggressive boys and their parents, as
well as some theoretical perspectives regarding the eects of dierent child-rearing practices on the behavior
and attitudes of adolescent boys (Bandura & Walters, 1959).

Much of the research focused, however, on

sociological issues involved in the environment of delinquent boys. Choosing a dierent approach, Bandura

decided to study boys who had no obvious sociological disadvantages (such as poverty, language diculties
due to recent immigration, low IQ, etc.). Bandura and Walters restricted their sample to boys of average
or above average intelligence, from intact homes, with steadily employed parents, whose families had been
settled in America for at least three generations. No children from minority groups were included either. In
other words, the boys were from apparently typical, White, middle-class American families. And yet, half
of the boys studied were identied through the county probation service or their school guidance center as
demonstrating serious, repetitive, antisocial, aggressive behavior (Bandura & Walters, 1959).
Citing the work of Dollard and Miller, as well as others who paved the way for social learning theory,
Bandura and Walters began their study on adolescent aggression by examining how the parents of delinquents
train their children to be socialized.

Working from a general learning perspective, emphasizing cues and

consequences, they found signicant problems in the development of socialization among the delinquent
boys. These boys developed dependency, a necessary step toward socialization, but they were not taught to
conform their behavior to the expectations of society. Consequently, they began to demand immediate and
unconditional gratication from their surroundings, something that seldom happens. Of course, this failure
to learn proper socialization does not necessarily lead to aggression, since it can also lead to lifestyles such
as the hobo, the bohemian, or the beatnik (Bandura & Walters, 1959). Why then do some boys become so
aggressive? To briey summarize their study, Bandura and Walters found that parents of delinquent boys
were more likely to model aggressive behavior and to use coercive punishment (as opposed to reasoning with
their children to help them conform to social norms). Although parental modeling of aggressive behavior
teaches such behavior to children, these parents tend to be eective at suppressing their children's aggressive
behavior at home. In contrast, however, they provide subtle encouragement for aggression outside the home.
As a result, these poorly socialized boys are likely to displace the aggressive impulses that develop in the
home, and they are well trained in doing so. If they happen to associate with a delinquent group (such as a
gang), they are provided with an opportunity to learn new and more eective ways to engage in antisocial
behavior, and they are directly rewarded for engaging in such behaviors (Bandura & Walters, 1959; also see
Bandura, 1973).
Having found evidence that parents of aggressive, delinquent boys had modeled aggressive behavior,
Bandura and his colleagues embarked on a series of studies on the modeling of aggression (Bandura, Ross,
& Ross, 1961, 1963a,b). Initially, children were given the opportunity to play in a room containing a variety
of toys, including the 5-foot tall, inated Bobo doll (a toy clown).

As part of the experiment, an adult

(the model) was also invited into the room to join in the game. When the model exhibited clear aggressive
behavior toward the Bobo doll, and then the children were allowed to play on their own, they children
demonstrated aggressive behavior as well.

The children who observed a model who was not aggressive

seldom demonstrated aggressive behavior, thus conrming that the aggression in the experimental group
resulted from observational learning. In the second study, children who observed the behavior of aggressive
models on lm also demonstrated a signicant increase in aggressive behavior, suggesting that the physical
presence of the model is not necessary (providing an important implication for violent aggression on TV and
in movies; see Personality in Theory in Real Life at the end of the chapter). In addition to conrming the
role of observation or social learning in the development of aggressive behavior, these studies also provided
a starting point for examining what it is that makes a model inuential.
One of the signicant ndings in this line of research on aggression is the inuence of models on behavioral
restraint. When children are exposed to models who are not aggressive and who inhibit their own behavior,
the children also tend to inhibit their own aggressive responses and to restrict their range of behavior in
general (Bandura, Ross, & Ross, 1961). Thus, children can learn from others, in particular their parents,
how to regulate their behavior in socially appropriate ways.

When the inappropriate behavior of others

is punished, the children observing are also vicariously punished, and likely to experience anxiety, if not
outright fear, when they consider engaging in similar inappropriate behavior. However, when models behave
aggressively and their behavior is rewarded, or even just tolerated, the child's own tendency to restrict
aggressive impulses may be weakened.

indierently to the actions of assailants, they convey the impression that aggression is not only acceptable
but expected in similar situations. By thus legitimizing aggressive conduct, observers anticipate less risk of
reprimand or loss of self-respect for such action. (pg. 129; Bandura, 1973)

Discussion Question: The concept of disinhibition is based on the belief that we all have aggressive
tendencies, and our self-control is diminished when we see models rewarded for aggressive behavior. Have
you ever found yourself in situations where someone was rewarded for acting aggressively? Did you then
adopt an aggressive attitude, or act out on your aggression?

Characteristics of the Modeling Situation
When one person matches the behavior of another, there are several perspectives on why that matching
behavior occurs. Theorists who suggest that matching behavior results from simple

imitation don't allow

for any signicant psychological changes. Dollard and Miller discussed imitation in their attempts to combine
traditional learning theory with a psychodynamic perspective, but they did not advance the theory very far.
A more traditional psychodynamic approach describes matching behavior as the result of

identication, the

concept that an observer connects with a model in some psychological way. However, identication means
dierent things to dierent theorists, and the term remains somewhat vague. In social learning, as it has
been advanced by Bandura, modeling is the term that best describes and, therefore, is used to characterize
the psychological processes that underlie matching behavior (Bandura, 1986).
Observational learning through modeling is not merely an alternative to Pavlovian or operant conditioning:
Learning would be exceedingly laborious, not to mention hazardous, if people had to rely solely on the
eects of their own actions to inform them what to do. Fortunately, most human behavior is learned observationally through modeling: from observing others one forms an idea of how new behaviors are performed,
and on later occasions this coded information serves as a guide for action. (pg. 22; Bandura, 1977)
Individuals dier in the degree to which they can be inuenced by models, and not all models are equally
eective. According to Bandura, three factors are most inuential in terms of the eectiveness of modeling
situations: the characteristics of the model, the attributes of the observers, and the consequences of the
model's actions. The most relevant characteristics of an inuential model are high status, competence, and
power. When observers are unsure about a situation, they rely on cues to indicate what they perceive as
evidence of past success by the model.

Such cues include general appearance, symbols of socioeconomic

success (e.g., a fancy sports car), and signs of expertise (e.g., a doctor's lab coat).

Since those models

appear to have been successful themselves, it seems logical that observers might want to imitate their
behavior. Individuals who are low in self-esteem, dependent, and who lack condence are not necessarily
more likely to be inuenced by models. Bandura proposed that when modeling is used to explicitly develop
new competencies, the ones who will benet most from the situation are those who are more talented and
more venturesome (Bandura, 1977).
Despite the potential inuence of models, the entire process of observational learning in a social learning

attentional
processes, retention processes, production (or reproduction) processes, and motivational processes
environment would probably not be successful if not for four important component processes:

(Bandura, 1977, 1986). The fact that an observer must pay attention to a model might seem obvious, but
some models are more likely to attract attention.

Individuals are more likely to pay attention to models

with whom they associate, even if the association is more cognitive than personal. It is also well-known that
people who are admired, such as those who are physically attractive or popular athletes, make for attentiongetting models. There are also certain types of media that are very good at getting people's attention, such
as television advertisements (Bandura, 1977, 1986). It is a curious cultural phenomenon that the television
advertisements presented during the National Football League's Super Bowl have become almost as much of
the excitement as the game itself (and even more exciting for those who are not football fans)!
The retention processes involve primarily an observer's memory for the modeled behavior.

The most

important memory processes, according to Bandura, are visual imagery and verbal coding, with visual
imagery being particularly important early in development when verbal skills are limited.

Once modeled

behavior has been transformed into visual and/or verbal codes, these memories can serve to guide the
performance of the behavior at appropriate times. When the modeled behavior is produced by the observer,

the so-called production process, the re-enactment can be broken down into the cognitive organization of
the responses, their initiation, subsequent monitoring, and nally the renement of the behavior based on
informative feedback. Producing complex modeled behaviors is not always an easy task:

. . .A common problem in learning complex skills, such as golf or swimming, is that performers cannot fully
observe their responses, and must therefore rely upon vague kinesthetic cues or verbal reports of onlookers.
It is dicult to guide actions that are only partially observable or to identify the corrections needed to
achieve a close match between representation and performance. (pg. 28; Bandura, 1977)
Finally, motivational processes determine whether the observer is inclined to match the modeled behavior
in the rst place. Individuals are most likely to model behaviors that result in an outcome they value, and
if the behavior seems to be eective for the models who demonstrated the behavior. Given the complexity
of the relationships between models, observers, the perceived eectiveness of modeled behavior, and the
subjective value of rewards, even using prominent models does not guarantee that they will be able to create
similar behavior in observers (Bandura, 1977, 1986).

Producing complex behaviors that cannot be readily observed by the performer can prove quite dicult.

A common misconception regarding modeling is that it only leads to learning the behaviors that have
been modeled. However, modeling can lead to innovative behavior patterns. Observers typically see a given
behavior performed by multiple models; even in early childhood one often gets to see both parents model
a given behavior.

When the behavior is then matched, the observer will typically select elements from

the dierent models, relying on only certain aspects of the behavior performed by each, and then create a
unique pattern that accomplishes the nal behavior. Thus, partial departures from the originally modeled
behavior can be a source of new directions, especially in creative endeavors (such as composing music or
creating a sculpture). In contrast, however, when simple routines prove useful, modeling can actually stie
innovation. So, the most innovative individuals appear to be those who have been exposed to innovative
models, provided that the models are not so innovative as to create an unreasonably dicult challenge in
modeling their creativity and innovation (Bandura, 1977, 1986; Bandura, Ross, & Ross, 1963b).

Discussion Question: Two of the components necessary for modeling to be eective, according to
Bandura, are attention and retention. What aspects of commercial advertisements are most likely to catch
your attention? What do you tend to remember about advertisements? Can you think of situations in which
the way an advertiser gets your attention also helps you to remember the product?

Connections Across Cultures: Global Marketing and Advertising
Although we are constantly surrounded by modeling situations, the most obvious and intentional use of
models and modeling is in advertising. As our world becomes increasingly global, the use of advertisements
that work well in one place may be entirely inappropriate in a dierent culture.

at universities in the Netherlands, Spain, Finland, and Germany, has undertaken the challenging task of
studying how culture aects consumer behavior and the consequences of those eects for marketing and
advertising in dierent societies around the world (de Mooij, 2000, 2004a,b, 2005).
To some, increasing globalization suggests that markets around the world will become more similar to
one another. De Mooij (2000), however, contends that as dierent cultures become more similar in economic
terms, their more personal cultural dierences will actually become more signicant! Thus, it is essential
for global businesses to understand those cultural dierences, so that marketing and advertising can be
appropriately adjusted. The challenge is in recognizing and dealing with the global-local paradox. People
in business are taught to think global, but act local. This is because most people throughout the world tend
to prefer things that are familiar. They may adopt and enjoy global products, but they remain true to their
own culture (de Mooij, 2005). Thus, it is important to understand local culture and consumer behavior in
general before beginning an advertising campaign in a foreign country.
In her studies on culture and consumer behavior, de Mooij (2004b, 2005) addresses a wide variety of
topics, including several that are covered in this chapter. In terms of the characteristics of models, many
countries do not emphasize physical attractiveness and/or fashionable clothes the way we do in America.
However, the overall aesthetic appeal of advertising can be more important in many Asian markets, focusing
on preferences for values such as nature and harmony. Given that America is generally an individualistic
culture and most Asian cultures are collectivistic, it should be no surprise that Americans tend to focus on
the appeal of the model whereas Asians tend to focus on the appeal of the overall scene and relationships
amongst the various aspects depicted within it. In a similar way, cultures dier in terms of their general
perspective on locus of control. In cultures that tend to believe that their lives are determined by external
forces, the moral authorities (such as the church and the press) are typically trusted. People in such cultures
might not be responsiveness to advertisements that call for individual restraint, such as eorts to reduce
cigarette smoking for better health, since they rely on their doctors (external agents) to take care of their
health.
There are also signicant dierences in how people in dierent cultures think and process information,
and cognitive processes underlie all aspects of social learning. Involvement theory suggests dierences in how
individuals and cultures dier in their approach to purchasing, and how advertising must take those dierences into account. For example, amongst American consumers considering a high involvement product
(such as a car), those who are likely to buy something respond to advertising in which they learn something,
develop a favorable attitude toward the product, and then buy it (learn-feel-do). For everyday products,
which are considered low involvement, consumers respond to advertising in which they learn something,
then buy the product, and perhaps afterward they tend to prefer that brand (learn-do-feel). There is now
evidence that in typically more collectivist cultures such as Japan, China, and Korea, it is important to rst
establish a relationship between the company and the consumer.

Only then does the consumer purchase

the particular product, and then they become more familiar with it (feel-do-learn). Thus, the very purpose
of advertising changes from culture to culture (de Mooij, 2004b). Naturally, a number of other approaches
to advertising exist, based on concepts such as: persuasion, awareness, emotions, and likeability (de Mooij,
2005). Each of these techniques relies on a dierent psychological approach, taking into account the observers
that the advertiser hopes to inuence (the so-called target demographic).
One of the most important aspects of advertising, when it is being carried from one culture to another,
is the translation of verbal and written information. Dierent languages have dierent symbolic references.
They rely on dierent myths, history, humor, and art, and failing to tap into such dierences is likely to
result in bland advertising that does not appeal to the local audience (de Mooij, 2004a). Other languages are
simply structured dierently as well, perhaps requiring meaning in a name, and this sometimes makes direct
translation impossible. Thus, an international advertiser must choose a dierent name for their product. For
example, Coca-Cola is marketed in China as the homonym

kekou kele,

which means tasty and happy (de

Mooij, 2004a). Visual references also have cultural meanings. A Nokia ad, shown in Finland, used a squirrel
in a forest to represent good reception and free movement in a deep forest.

countries can be grouped into preferred styles. Based on a comparison of multiple dimensions of preferred
verbal style, some of the countries that share similar styles are: 1) the United States, the United Kingdom,
Norway, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Denmark; 2) Austria, Finland, and Germany; 3) India, China, and
Singapore; and 4) Italy, Spain, Belgium, France, Argentina, Brazil, and the Arab world (de Mooij, 2004a).
As challenging as it might seem to address these issues (and the many more we have not covered), it is
essential for individuals involved in global marketing and advertising:
The cultural variety of countries worldwide as well as in Europe implies that success in one country
does not automatically mean success in other countries. . .nding the most relevant cultural values is dicult, especially because many researchers are based in Western societies that are individualistic and have
universalistic values. Western marketers, advertisers, and researchers are inclined to search for similarities,
whereas understanding the dierences will be more protable. . .There are global products and global brands,
but there are no global buying motives for such brands because people are not global. Understanding people
across cultures is the rst and most important step in international marketing. (pg. 314; de Mooij, 2004b)
Finally, none of these approaches to international marketing and advertising is going to be successful
if business relationships are not established in the rst place. In

Business,

The Cultural Dimension of International

Ferraro (2006b) oers a comprehensive guide to understanding cultural dierences. In addition

to the importance of being aware of such factors, which the very existence of the books and articles in this
section belies, Ferraro emphasizes cultural dierences in communication. For individuals working in a foreign
country where English is not the rst language, good communication becomes a matter of intent:
Because communication is so vitally important for conducting business at home, it should come as no
surprise that it is equally important for successful business abroad.

The single best way to become an

eective communicator as an expatriate is to learn the local language. . .Besides knowing how to speak
another language, expatriate candidates should demonstrate a willingness to use it. For a variety of reasons,
some people lack the motivation, condence, or willingness to throw themselves into conversational situations.

[Authors note: see the section on self-ecacy below] . . .Thus, communication skills must be assessed in terms
of language competency, motivation to learn another language, and willingness to use it in professional and
personal situations. (pg. 170; Ferraro, 2006b)

Self-Regulation and Self-Ecacy
Self-regulation and self-ecacy are two elements of Bandura's theory that rely heavily on cognitive
processes. They represent an individual's ability to control their behavior through internal reward or punishment, in the case of self-regulation, and their beliefs in their ability to achieve desired goals as a result
of their own actions, in the case of self-ecacy. Bandura never rejects the inuence of external rewards or
punishments, but he proposes that including internal,

self-reinforcement and self-punishment expands

the potential for learning:

. . .Theories

that explain human behavior as solely the product of external rewards and punishments

present a truncated image of people because they possess self-reactive capacities that enable them to exercise
some control over their own feelings, thoughts, and actions. Behavior is therefore regulated by the interplay
of self-generated and external sources of inuence. . . (pg. 129; Bandura, 1977)
Self-regulation is a general term that includes both self-reinforcement and self-punishment.

Self-

reinforcement works primarily through its motivational eects. When an individual sets a standard of performance for themselves, they judge their behavior and determine whether or not it meets the self-determined
criteria for reward. Since many activities do not have absolute measures of success, the individual often sets
their standards in relative ways. For example, a weight-lifter might keep track of how much total weight they
lift in each training session, and then monitor their improvement over time or as each competition arrives.
Although competitions oer the potential for external reward, the individual might still set a personal standard for success, such as being satised only if they win at least one of the individual lifts. The standards
that an individual sets for themselves can be learned through modeling.

This can create problems when

models are highly competent, much more so than the observer is capable of performing (such as learning the
standards of a world-class athlete). Children, however, seem to be more inclined to model the standards of
low-achieving or moderately competent models, setting standards that are reasonably within their own reach
(Bandura, 1977). According to Bandura, the cumulative eect of setting standards and regulating one's own

performance in terms of those standards can lead to judgments about one's self. Within a social learning
context, negative self-concepts arise when one is prone to devalue oneself, whereas positive self-concepts arise
from a tendency to judge oneself favorably (Bandura, 1977). Overall, the complexity of this process makes
predicting the behavior of an individual rather dicult, and behavior often deviates from social norms in
ways that would not ordinarily be expected. However, this appears to be the case in a variety of cultures,
suggesting that it is indeed a natural process for people (Bandura & Walters, 1963).
As noted above,  perceived self-ecacy refers to beliefs in one's capabilities to organize and execute
the courses of action required to produce given attainments  (Bandura, 1997). The desire to control our
circumstances in life seems to have been with us throughout history. In ancient times, when people knew
little about the world, they prayed in the hope that benevolent gods would help them and/or protect them
from evil gods. Elaborate rituals were developed in the hope or belief that the gods would respond to their
eorts and dedication. As we learned more about our world and how it works, we also learned that we can
have a signicant impact on it. Most importantly, we can have a direct eect on our immediate personal
environment, especially with regard to personal relationships.

What motivates us to try inuencing our

environment is specic ways is the belief that we can, indeed, make a dierence in a direction we want.
Thus, research has focused largely on what people think about their ecacy, rather than on their actual
ability to achieve their goals (Bandura, 1997).
Self-ecacy has been a popular topic for research, and Bandura's book

of Control

(1997) is some 600 pages long.

Self-Ecacy: The Exercise

We will address two key issues on this fascinating topic: the

relationships between (1) ecacy beliefs and outcome expectancies and (2) self-ecacy and

self-esteem. In

any situation, one has beliefs about one's ability to inuence the situation, and yet those beliefs are typically
balanced against realistic expectations that change can occur.

Each side of the equation can have both

negative and positive qualities. Suppose, as a student, you are concerned about the rising cost of a college
education, and you would like to challenge those rising costs. You may believe that there is nothing you can
do (negative) and tuition and fees will inevitably increase (negative). This dual negative perspective leads
to resignation and apathy, certainly not a favorable situation. But what if you believe you can change the
college's direction (positive), and that the college can cut certain costs in order to oset the need for higher
tuition (positive). Now you are likely to engage the college community in productive discussions, and this
may lead to personal satisfaction (Bandura, 1997). In the rst scenario, you are not likely to do anything,
in the second scenario you will most likely be highly motivated to act, even energized as you work toward
productive changes. Of course, there are two other possible scenarios. You may believe there is nothing you
can do (negative), but that change is possible (positive).

In this case, you are likely to devalue yourself,

perhaps feeling depressed about your own inability to accomplish good. Conversely, you may believe there is
something you can do (positive), but that external forces will make change dicult or impossible (negative).
This may lead some people to challenge the system in spite of their lack of expected change, resulting in
protests and other forms of social activism (Bandura, 1997). Since all of these scenarios are based on beliefs
and expectations, not on the unknown eventual outcome that will occur, it becomes clear that what we think
about our ability to perform in various situations, as well as our actual expectations of the consequences of
those actions, has both complex and profound eects on our motivation to engage in a particular behavior
or course of action.
As for self-ecacy and self-esteem, these terms are often used interchangeably, and on the surface that
might seem appropriate. Wouldn't we feel good about ourselves if we believed in our abilities to achieve our
goals? In fact, self-ecacy and self-esteem are entirely dierent:

. . .There is no xed relationship between beliefs about one's capabilities and whether one likes or dislikes
oneself. Individuals may judge themselves hopelessly inecacious in a given activity without suering any
loss of self-esteem whatsoever, because they do not invest their self-worth in that activity. (pg. 11; Bandura,
1997)
For example, my family was active in the Korean martial art Taekwondo. Taekwondo emphasizes powerful
kicks. Because I suer from degenerative joint disease in both hips, there are certain kicks I simply can't do,
and I don't do any of the kicks particularly well. But I accept that, and focus my attention on areas where
I am successful, such as forms and helping to teach the white belt class. Likewise, Bandura notes that his

complete inecacy in ballroom dancing does not lead him into bouts of self-devaluation (Bandura, 1997).
So, though it may improve our self-esteem to have realistic feelings of self-ecacy in challenging situations,
there is not necessarily any corresponding loss of self-esteem when we acknowledge our weaknesses.

And

even positive self-ecacy might not lead to higher self-esteem when a task is simple or unpleasant. To cite
Bandura's example, someone might be very good at evicting people from their homes when they can't pay
their rent or mortgage, but that skill might not lead to positive feelings of self-esteem. This concept was the
basis for the classic story

A Christmas Carol,

featuring the character Ebenezer Scrooge (Charles Dickens,

1843/1994).

The Development of Self-Ecacy
Young children have little understanding of what they can and cannot do, so the development of realistic
self-ecacy is a very important process:

. . .Very

young children lack knowledge of their own capabilities and the demands and potential hazards

of dierent courses of action. They would repeatedly get themselves into dangerous predicaments were it not
for the guidance of others. They can climb to high places, wander into rivers or deep pools, and wield sharp
knives before they develop the necessary skills for managing such situations safely. . .Adult watchfulness and
guidance see young children through this early formative period until they gain sucient knowledge of what
they can do and what dierent situations require in the way of skills. (pg. 414; Bandura, 1986)
During infancy, the development of perceived causal ecacy, in other words the perception that one
has aected the world by one's own actions, appears to be an important aspect of developing a sense of
self.

As the infant interacts with its environment, the infant is able to cause predictable events, such as

the sound that accompanies shaking a rattle. The understanding that one's own actions can inuence the
environment is something Bandura refers to as

personal agency, the ability to act as an agent of change

in one's own world. The infant also begins to experience that certain events aect models dierently than
the child. For example, if a model touches a hot stove it does not hurt the infant, so the infant begins to
recognize their uniqueness, their actual existence as an individual.

During this period, interactions with

the physical environment may be more important than social interactions, since the physical environment
is more predictable, and therefore easier to learn about (Bandura, 1986, 1997).

Quickly, however, social

interaction becomes highly inuential.
Not only does the child learn a great deal from the family, but as they grow peers become increasingly
important. As the child's world expands, peers bring with them a broadening of self-ecacy experiences.
This can have both positive and negative consequences. Peers who are most experienced and competent can
become important models of behavior. However, if a child perceives themselves as socially inecacious, but
does develop self-ecacy in coercive, aggressive behavior, then that child is likely to become a bully. In the
midst of this eort to learn socially acceptable behavior, most children also begin attending school, where the
primary focus is on the development of cognitive ecacy. For many children, unfortunately, the academic
environment of school is a challenge. Children quickly learn to rank themselves (grades help, both good and
bad), and children who do poorly can lose the sense of self-ecacy that is necessary for continued eort at
school. According to Bandura, it is important that educational practices focus not only on the content they
provide, but also on what they do to children's beliefs about their abilities (Bandura, 1986, 1997).
As children continue through adolescence toward adulthood, they need to assume responsibility for themselves in all aspects of life. They must master many new skills, and a sense of condence in working toward
the future is dependent on a developing sense of self-ecacy supported by past experiences of mastery. In
adulthood, a healthy and realistic sense of self-ecacy provides the motivation necessary to pursue success in
one's life. Poorly equipped adults, wracked with self-doubt, often nd life stressful and depressing. Even psychologically healthy adults must eventually face the realities of aging, and the inevitable decline in physical
status. There is little evidence, however, for signicant declines in mental states until very advanced old age.
In cultures that admire youth, there may well be a tendency for the aged to lose their sense of self-ecacy
and begin an inexorable decline toward death.

But in societies that promote self-growth throughout life,

and who admire elders for their wisdom and experience, there is potential for aged individuals to continue
living productive and self-fullling lives (Bandura, 1986, 1997).

refers to how we feel about ourselves. What are you good at? Do others agree that you are good at that
skill? When you nd yourself trying to do something that you are NOT good at, does it disappoint you (i.e.,
lower your self-esteem)?

Behavior Modication
In Principles of Behavior Modication

(Bandura, 1969), Bandura suggests that behavioral approaches

to psychological change, whether in clinical settings or elsewhere, have a distinct advantage over many of
the other theories that have arisen in psychology. Whereas psychological theories often arise rst, become
popular as approaches to psychotherapy, but then fail to withstand proper scientic validation, behavioral
approaches have a long history of rigorous laboratory testing. Thus, behavioral techniques are often validated
rst, and then prove to be applicable in clinical settings. Indeed, behavioral and cognitive approaches to
psychotherapy are typically well respected amongst psychotherapists (though some might consider their
range somewhat limited).
Bandura made several points regarding the application of social learning theory to behaviorally-oriented
psychotherapy. For example, Bandura notes that the labeling of psychological disorders, indeed the denition
of what constitutes abnormal behavior, is made within a social context. While it has been demonstrated
that common categories of mental illness are seen throughout a wide variety of cultures (Murphy, 1976),
we still view those with psychological disorders based on sociocultural norms and, in the case of too many
observers, with unreasonable prejudice. Bandura also opposed the medical model of categorizing and treating
psychopathology, believing that the desire to identify and utilize medications has hindered the advancement
of applying appropriate psychotherapies. The application of an appropriate therapy involves issues of ethical
concern and goal-setting. Therapy cannot be successful, according to Bandura, if it does not have clear goals
characterized in terms of observable behaviors. Choosing goals means that one must make value judgments.
In making these decisions it is important that the client and the therapist share similar values (or at least
that the therapist work with values appropriate for their client), and that the therapist does not try to
impose their own values on the client (Bandura, 1969).
Overall, Bandura presents behavioral approaches to psychotherapy as non-judgmental applications of
learning principles to problematic behavior, behavior that is not to be viewed as psychological illness:

. . .From a social-learning perspective, behaviors that may be detrimental to the individual or that depart
widely from accepted social and ethical norms are considered not as manifestations of an underlying pathology
but as ways, which the person has learned, of coping with environmental and self-imposed demands. (pg.
62; Bandura, 1969)

Cognitive Aspects of Social Learning Theory: The Contributions of Julian Rotter
and Walter Mischel
Julian Rotter deserves at least as much credit as Albert Bandura for the establishment of social learning
theory.

Social Learning & Clinical Psychology (Rotter, 1954) was published ve years
Adolescent Aggression (Bandura & Walters, 1959). In addition, Rotter always focused on

Indeed, his book

before Bandura's

cognitive aspects of social learning, something Bandura gave more consideration to only later in his career.
But their careers were by no means separated from one another.

Walter Mischel was Rotter's graduate

student, and later joined the faculty of Stanford University where he was a colleague of Bandura. Mischel
and Bandura collaborated on some of Mischel's best known research: delayed gratication.

Brief Biographies of Julian Rotter and Walter Mischel
Julian Rotter was born in 1916 in Brooklyn, NY. The son of successful Jewish immigrants, his childhood
was quite comfortable. During the Great Depression, however, the family business failed, and for a few years
the family struggled (as many people did). This time of struggle instilled in Rotter a profound sense of social
justice, as well as an interest in the eects of situational environments.
As a child Rotter was an avid reader, and eventually he read most of the novels in the local library.
He then turned to reading books on psychology, taking a particular interest in works by Freud and Adler.
During his senior year in high school he was interpreting people's dreams and he wrote a paper based on
Freud's

Psychopathology of Everyday Life

(Freud, 1904/1995). He attended Brooklyn College, but chose to

major in chemistry instead of psychology, as it seemed more likely to provide a promising career. During
college, however, he learned that Adler was teaching at the Long Island College of Medicine.

He began

DEVELOPMENT

attending Adler's seminars, became Adler's friend, and was invited to meetings of the Society for Individual
Psychology. Another well-known psychology professor who inuenced Rotter was Solomon Asch. When he
graduated from Brooklyn College, he actually had more credits in psychology than in chemistry.
Rotter attended the University of Iowa, where he earned a Master's Degree in 1938, and then took a
clinical internship at the Worcester State Hospital in Massachusetts. A year later he began working on his
Ph.D. at Indiana University, because a professor there, C. M Louttit, had published one of the rst books
advocating clinical psychology as a career. Rotter received his Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology in 1941. After a
short period of time at Norwich State Hospital in Connecticut, Rotter was drafted into the Army. He spent
World War II working as a military psychologist. After the war he briey returned to Norwich, but soon
Rotter accepted a position at Ohio State University.
It was during his time at Ohio State University that Rotter developed his ideas on social learning theory.
He and George Kelly were the two most prominent members of the psychology department, each of them
having a lasting inuence in the elds of social and cognitive learning theory. Rotter attracted many excellent
graduate students, including Walter Mischel.

Rotter was also keenly interested in the training of clinical

psychologists, and he helped to outline the training model that became the basis for how doctoral level
clinical psychologists are trained today.
As much as he enjoyed his time at Ohio State University, Rotter left in 1963 to direct the rebuilding
of the clinical psychology training program at the University of Connecticut. He retired as professor emeritus in 1987. One year later he received an American Psychological Association's

Contribution Award,

Distinguished Scientic

and one year after that he was recognized by the Council of University Directors of

Clinical Psychology with their

Distinguished Contribution to Clinical Training Award.

He has also worked

with the Peace Corps. Rotter included a brief autobiography in his self-edited compendium entitled

Development and Applications of Social Learning Theory

The

(Rotter, 1982).

Walter Mischel was born in 1930, into a comfortable home, where he enjoyed a pleasant childhood. They
lived in Vienna, a short distance from Sigmund Freud's house. However, when the Nazis invaded Austria at
the beginning of World War II, the Mischel family moved to the United States, eventually settling in New
York City. In college, Mischel studied to become a social worker. While working as a social worker in the
Lower East Side slums, Mischel attended City College of New York and pursued a graduate degree in clinical
psychology. He had been taught that Freud's theory oered the best explanation of human behavior, but he
did not nd this to be true in his work with juvenile delinquents (the same practical conclusion occurred to
Carl Rogers in his rst clinical position).
He then attended Ohio State University, where he was a graduate student of both Julian Rotter and
George Kelly. Rotter and Kelly helped to rmly establish Mischel as a member of the general social learning/cognitive learning camp, and later Mischel became a faculty member at Stanford University, alongside
Albert Bandura (from 1962-1983). He then returned to New York as a faculty member at Columbia University, where he continued his work on delayed gratication and the eects of situations on personal behavior.
Mischel has been recognized with a

Distinguished Scientic Contribution Award

by the American Psycho-

logical Association.

Placing Rotter and Mischel in Context: Cognitive Social Learning Theory
The distinction between Bandura as a social learning theorist, and Rotter and Mischel as cognitive
learning theorists, is not entirely accurate. As Bandura's career progressed, he focused more and more on
cognitive factors, and Mischel collaborated with Bandura while both were at Stanford University.

What

distinguishes Rotter and Mischel is that cognitive factors were always the most important aspect of their
learning theories. Although humans are capable of learning simply by watching a model, their expectations
regarding the outcome of a situation, and the value the place on the potential reward (or punishment),
determines their course of action. According to Mischel, these variables can lead to seemingly inconsistent
behavior, but when examined in closer detail individuals demonstrate consistent patterns of variation, a form
of consistency in itself.
Rotter and Mischel can also be seen as having encompassed Bandura's career. Although all three men
were active during the same general time frame, Rotter's rst book on social learning theory preceded

403

Bandura's rst book by 5 years. Mischel, a student of Rotter, and then a colleague of Bandura for a while,
has continued to modify his most inuential theory quite recently, in the 1990s and 2000s.
Rotter and Mischel can also be considered as providing a bridge between the more traditional social
learning theory of Bandura and the full-edged cognitive theory of George Kelly. Kelly was Rotter's colleague
at Ohio State University, and Mischel studied under both men while in graduate school. Thus, social learning
theory, cognitive social learning theory, and cognitive theories of personality development all occurred in close
relationship to one another, and they all oered a dramatic alternative to radical behaviorism, an alternative
that helped to fulll the vision of John Dollard and Neal Miller.

Basic Constructs in Rotter's Social Learning Theory
Rotter's early research focused on the need to understand human behavior and personality so that clinical
psychologists might eectively help their patients. In the preface to

Social Learning & Clinical Psychology,

Rotter wrote:

. . .the

practice of clinical psychology in many instances is unsystematic and confused when viewed from

logical or rigorous scientic viewpoints. This confusion, however, is not a necessary condition but the result
of the failure of the clinical psychologists' training program to translate and relate the basic knowledge of
experimental and theoretical psychology into the practical situations of the clinic, the hospital, and the
school. . . (pg. viii; Rotter, 1954)
Given his emphasis on clinical psychology, Rotter focused on the clinician's ability to predict behavior.
According to Rotter, social learning theory assumes that the unit of investigation for the study of personality
is the interaction between the individual and their meaningful environment. Although personality has unity,
the individual's experiences inuence each other. As a result, personality is continuously changing, since each
person is always having new experiences. However, personality is also stable in some respects, since previous
experiences inuence new learning. Given the complexity of each individual, Rotter believed that in order to

behavior
potential, expectancy, reinforcement value, and the psychological situation (Rotter, 1954, 1964,

make reasonable predictions about behavior it was necessary to examine four kinds of variables:
1972; Rotter & Hochreich, 1975).

Behavior potential refers to the likelihood of a certain behavior occurring in the context of specic
potential reinforcement.

For example, in order to earn good grades a student can rely on any number

of possible behaviors, such as studying, cheating, skipping class to avoid a bad grade, etc. Each potential
behavior can only be described as more or less likely than other potential behaviors, and included as potential
behaviors are psychological reactions such as thoughts, emotions, and even defense mechanisms. Expectancy
is dened as the probability held by the individual that reinforcement will follow one's chosen behavior.
Although Rotter preferred to avoid the concept that expectancy is subjective, he acknowledged that an
element of subjectivity is involved. Regardless, it is the individual's point of view, their expectations in a
given situation, that are more important for predicting behavior than the realistic probability of a chosen
behavior resulting in an expected reinforcement. Reinforcement value, quite simply, refers to the preference
for a given reinforcer. To use Rotter's own example, most people would consistently choose to be paid $10
dollars an hour rather than $1 an hour, if it were simply their choice.

Finally, there is the psychological

situation. According to Rotter, it is not enough to say that to each individual a given situation might seem
dierent. In order to address the situation in more objective terms, psychologists need to identify a variety of
cues within the situation. In an objective sense, consequently, dierent people can be described as attending
to dierent specic cues in the environment (Rotter, 1954, 1972; Rotter & Hochreich, 1975).
Although Rotter broke new ground in this approach to the study of social learning theory, he did not
entirely abandon the use of mathematical formulae similar to those of Dollard and Miller. Rotter proposed
the following basic formula for predicting goal-directed behavior:
BPx,S1Ra = /(Ex,RaS1 & RVa,S1 )
Although this formula appears complicated at rst glance, it is relatively straightforward. The potential
for behavior x (BPx) to occur in situation 1 with potential reinforcement a (S1Ra) is a function (/) of the
expectancy (E) that reinforcement a will follow behavior x in situation 1 (x,RaS1) and the reinforcement
value (RV) of reinforcement a in situation 1 (a,S1) (Rotter, 1954; Rotter & Hochreich, 1975).

In other

words, we are most likely to choose the behavioral option that we realistically expect will result in the most

favorable outcome in our current situation.

Discussion Question: Rotter believed that both the expectancy of reward and the perceived value of
that reward were essential in determining whether an individual engaged in a particular behavior. Have you
ever found yourself doing something even though you did not expect to get anything for your eorts? Have
you ever had a job where you felt that you weren't being paid what you deserved? In such situations, how
long did you continue your behavior, and how did you feel about it?

Locus of Control
One of the most important generalized expectancies underlying behavior, and perhaps Rotter's best
known concept, is referred to as
as

internal versus external control of reinforcement (commonly known

locus of control):
People are known to dier in their belief that what happens to them is the result of their own behaviors

and attributes (internal control) versus the result of luck, fate, chance, or powerful others (external control).
Clearly, persons who believe or expect that they can control their own destinies will behave dierently, in
many situations, than those who expect that their outcomes are controlled by other people or determined
by luck. (pg. 105; Rotter & Hochreich, 1975)
Rotter pointed out that almost all psychologists recognize the role that reinforcement or reward plays in
determining future behavior, but that this is not a simple stamping-in process. For beings as complex as
humans, the eects of reinforcement depend upon an individual's perception of a causal relationship between
their behavior and the potential reward (Rotter & Hochreich, 1975).
A number of scales have been developed to measure locus of control (for an early review see Lefcourt,
1976), including one developed by Rotter himself (Rotter, 1966). Rotter's scale, simply referred to as the

I-E scale (for internal-external), consists of 29 forced-choice statements. For example:
1.a. Children get into trouble because their parents punish them too much.
1.b. The trouble with most children nowadays is that their parents are too
easy with them.
In each instance, the person taking the test must choose one or the other option. After taking all 29, the
person's score is the total number of external choices. Does it seem dicult to determine whether 1.a. or
1.b. is the external choice? Good! Question 1 is actually a ller question, designed to interfere with the test
taker's ability to understand what the test is about! So, consider question 2:
2.a. Many of the unhappy things in people's lives are partly due to
bad luck.
2.b. People's misfortunes result from the mistakes they make.
For question 2 it is quite obvious that choice a is the external choice, and if it wasn't clear, the test
has choice a marked for you! There are a total of six ller questions, leaving the test itself with 23 choices
(Rotter, 1966).
Locus of control appears to arise from two primary sources: the family, and

contingency awareness

(Lefcourt, 1976). The role of the family in the development of locus of control is complex, and appears to
be somewhat dierent based on the behavior of mothers and fathers. The most reliable nding appears to
be that individuals with an internal locus of control had mothers who pushed them to achieve independence
at an early age. This motherly push, however, must be a careful one. Children need support, guidance and
nurturance, but they must not be smothered to the point of being pampered. Lefcourt (1976) cites Adler's
concern regarding two extremes in child-rearing, pampering and neglect, neither of which is conducive to the
healthy psychological growth of a child. Contingency awareness refers to an understanding of instrumentality,
the conception that one's actions are indeed related to certain outcomes. In order for a child to repeat a
behavior with purpose, the child must be able to recall that their prior actions resulted in a given outcome,
and they must know that their actions were related to the expected outcomes. It would appear that children
as young as two months old are capable of this type of social learning, and it tends to result in positive
emotional reactions (Lefcourt, 1976).
Early studies on locus of control also focused on some interesting cultural questions.

It is generally

accepted that social class and ethnic group are important determinants of personality. Battle and Rotter
(1963) found that lower class Blacks were signicantly more external in their locus of control than were

405

middle class Whites. Interestingly, middle class Blacks were closer to middle class Whites than lower class
Whites were to middle class Whites, suggesting that social class may have been the primary factor in these
results, rather than the race or ethnicity of the subjects. Furthermore, IQ seems to have exacerbated these
results in that the most external individuals were high IQ lower class Blacks (i.e., individuals aware of social
injustice in American society) and the most internal individuals were low IQ middle class Whites (who may
be blaming themselves for failing to live up to their expected potential; Battle & Rotter, 1963). During the
civil rights movement, Gore & Rotter (1963) examined whether locus of control might be a useful measure
of social action. They found that students at a southern Black college who expressed interest in attending a
civil rights rally or marching on the state capitol scored signicantly more internal on the I-E scale. In other
words, those who believed they could personally make a dierence were more willing to try making that
dierence. In a study that followed soon after, Strickland (1965) compared Blacks who were indeed active
in the civil rights movement to those who were not (but who were matched for sex, age, education, etc.).
As predicted, the individuals who were active in the civil rights movement scored signicantly more internal
on the I-E scale than those who were not active.

Strickland did note, however, that the individuals she

studied were pioneers in the civil rights movement, and had become active, in part, because others groups
had failed to demonstrate an adequate degree of commitment to the civil rights movement.

Strickland's

concern seems to contradict earlier results of Mischel (1958a), who found that when individual's make public
commitments, they are less likely to change their expectancies (i.e., individuals publicly involved in the civil
rights movement should have remained committed to the cause even when faced with initial failure). Still, as
Mischel himself noted, one cannot rely entirely on inferences from research when considering the complexities
of real-life (and, at the time, dangerous) behavior.

Discussion Question: Do you consider yourself to have an internal or an external locus of control? Do
you feel that locus of control is an important inuence on personality; might it be good or bad?

Rotter's Emphasis on Clinical Psychology
As noted above, Rotter was actively involved in developing the model that provided the basis for how
clinical psychologists are typically trained today. Accordingly, much of Rotter's career was devoted to clinical
applications of his work, In addition to writing two books that emphasized clinical psychology (Rotter, 1954,
1964) and developing the I-E scale (Rotter, 1966), Rotter and one of his research assistants published

Rotter Incomplete Sentences Blank: College Form

The

sentence completion method, particularly for use with college students. The test consists of

forty simple statements that require the subject to nish the sentence. For example, one beginning is simply
My father. . . The subjects responses are then scored in terms of whether they demonstrate conict (on a
scale of 1-3), are neutral, or whether they are positive (also on a scale of 1-3). The manual oers examples
of possible answers for both males and females. For example, conicted responses for males include breaking
promises or being a fool (level 3), or never had much of a chance or is proud (level 1). A neutral response
might simply be that the father is a salesman, or is a hard worker. Positive responses for females include that
the father is quite a character or is a good man (level 1), or that he has a great sense of humor or is a lot of
fun (level 3). Interpreting this test requires a great deal of experience, and an understanding of personality

Rotter Incomplete Sentences Blank can be used to evaluate individuals. Both the Rotter

Incomplete Sentences Blank and the I-E scale have proven useful in evaluating patients, as well as normal
individuals, in a variety of settings and cultures, including Africa, Sri Lanka, American Indians, Brazil,
Black and White college students in America, Ukrainian doctors training in Canada, and amongst military
personnel (Janzen, Paterson, Reid, & Everall, 1996; Lefcourt, 1976; Logan & Waehler, 2001; Nagelschmidt
& Jakob, 1977; Niles, 1981; Picano, Roland, Rollins, & Williams, 2002; Rossier, Dahourou, & McCrae, 2005;
Rotter, 1960, 1966; Trimble & Richardson, 1982). In a particularly interesting study, a unique version of
the Sentence Completion Test was developed by Herbert Phillips and provided the basis for a major study
on the personality of Thai peasants living in the village of Bang Chan, Thailand (Phillips, 1965).

The

Rotter Incomplete Sentences Blank, and other variations of the sentence completion method, remain very
popular today (Holaday, Smith, & Sherry, 2000), ranking with the Rorschach Inkblot Test and the Thematic
Apperception Test as the most popular projective tests for personality assessment.

DEVELOPMENT

Overall, Rotter emphasized the value of training clinical psychologists for just that responsibility, with
a particular emphasis on the realities that will face the psychologist in an actual clinical setting (Rotter,
1954, 1964).

In 1972, Rotter edited a volume including both original and previously published papers in

which social learning theory was applied to psychopathology in general (Phares, 1972) and to such diverse
topics as drinking amongst college students, excessively needy individuals, working with mentally retarded
children, and electroconvulsive shock therapy (Cromwell, 1972; Dies, 1968; Jessor, Carman, & Grossman,
1968; Jessor, Liverant, & Opochinsky, 1963). A particularly important aspect of therapy also addressed in
this volume is the issue of terminating therapy. Strickland & Crowne (1963) found that defensiveness and
avoiding self-criticism are common signs in individuals who are likely to end therapy abruptly, whereas Piper,
Wogan, & Getter (1972) found that the patient's expectancy regarding improvement, and the value they
place on improving, are useful predictors of terminating therapy. Although helping patient's to achieve a
level of psychological health that allows terminating therapy should be the goal of every therapist, premature
termination might prove even more detrimental to the patient. For Rotter, the proper training of clinical
psychologists is not an easy task. In the preface to

. . .Yet

Clinical Psychology,

Rotter wrote:

psychology itself is a relatively new science and its areas of application are in rapid transition.

Neither theory nor facts are always agreed upon, and in clinical psychology there is no single set of
orthodox, approved skills for which a person can be certied as a trained practitioner. . .The goal is to gain
comprehension without resorting to an oversimplication of the complex nature of man or of the problem of
understanding him. (pg. xi; Rotter, 1964).

Behavioral Specicity and Consistency
In 1968, Walter Mischel challenged both state and trait theories of personality.

Psychological states

typically fall with the domain of psychodynamic theory, whereas trait theories are a perspective unto themselves. According to Mischel (1968), although state and trait theorists use very dierent language, they tend
to approach personality in the same general way: they use responses to infer pervasive, underlying mental
structures that exert enduring causal eects on behavior. Thus, both state and trait theorists emphasize
consistency in behavior. However, there is a wealth of data that individuals do not act consistently from
situation to situation.

Instead, Mischel argues, behavior can best be predicted only when one takes into

account the specic situation in which the behavior occurs:
Progress in the area of personality psychology and assessment has been hindered by the failure to apply
relevant principles about the conditions that produce, maintain, and modify social behavior. The principles
that emerge from basic research too often have not been seen as directly relevant to the understanding of the
determinants of test responses in the clinic or the assessment project. It is as if we live in two independent
worlds: The abstractions and articial situations of the laboratory and the realities of life. (pg. 1; Mischel,
1968).
In order to support his argument, Mischel examined which aspects of behavior are or are not consistent.
Generally, intellect is consistent, including academic ability, achievement, and cognitive style. In contrast,
there is little evidence to support consistency of behavior across situations when examining personality
variables such as attitudes, moral behavior, sexual identication, dependency, aggression, tolerance, conditionability, etc.

(Mischel, 1968).

How, then, might we predict behavior?

Mischel suggests a dynamic

perspective on how persons interact with their situations. If the environment has not changed much, we can
expect past behavior to be a reasonable predictor of current behavior (and state and trait theories would
seem to hold true as well).

However, if the environment changes dramatically, the individual may act in

unpredictable ways. In addition, the individual may begin to learn new social conditions, thus allowing for
considerable change in behavior over time:
Global traits and states are excessively crude, gross units to encompass adequately the extraordinary
complexity and subtlety of the discriminations that people constantly make. Traditional trait-state conceptions of man have depicted him as victimized by his infantile history, as possessed by unchanging rigid trait
attributes, and as driven inexorably by unconscious irrational forces. . .A more adequate conceptualization
must take full account of man's extraordinary adaptiveness and capacities for discrimination, awareness,
and self-regulation. . .and that an understanding of how humans can constructively modify their behavior in
systematic ways is the core of a truly dynamic personality psychology. (pg. 301; Mischel, 1968)

Delayed Gratication
Perhaps Mischel's most famous contribution to psychology is his research on

delayed gratication. In

a series of studies, begun in the late 1950s, Mischel examined the conditions under which children choose
immediate gratication or whether they can delay gratication in order to obtain a larger reinforcer at a
later time. The ability to delay gratication, according to Mischel, is essential for the development of selfcontrol. From early childhood throughout the lifespan, achieving long-term goals often requires setting aside
tempting distractions.

Conversely, many personal and social problems result from failures of self-control,

such as dropping out of school, poor job performance, and even violent and criminal behavior (Mischel &
Mischel, 1980). In an amazing longitudinal study, Mischel and his colleagues oered 4 year-old children the
opportunity to grab a marshmallow. But, if the child could wait until the researcher ran an errand, the child
could then have two marshmallows! Some children grabbed the marshmallow as soon as the experimenter left,
but others were able to wait 15-20 minutes. It was not easy, however. The children who waited demonstrated
a variety of behaviors to distract themselves from the marshmallow: they would play, sing, cover their eyes
so they didn't have to look at the marshmallow, etc. The most striking results from this study were actually
obtained years later. Mischel and his colleagues tracked down the former 4 year-old subjects as they were
graduating from high school. The individuals who had delayed gratication as 4 year-olds were signicantly
more personally eective and self-assertive, and they were better able to cope with life's frustrations (Mischel,
Shoda, & Rodriguez, 1989; Shoda, Mischel, & Peake, 1990). In addition, the 4 year-old children who had
been able to delay gratication were more successful as students in a variety of ways, including eventually
earning signicantly higher SAT scores (210 points higher, on the combined score), and the ability to delay
gratication proved to be a better predictor of SAT scores than IQ (Peake, cited in Goleman, 1994).
Although the famous marshmallow-grabbing study was conducted at a preschool on the campus of Stanford University, Mischel began this research with very dierent groups: Black and East Indian children on
the islands of Trinidad and Grenada (Mischel, 1958b, 1961). On these relatively poor, Caribbean islands,
Mischel not only compared the Black and East Indian children, he also compared the children of Trinidad to
the children of Grenada. The main purpose of the second study, however, was to examine the eect of fathers
being absent from the home on the preference of children for immediate or delayed gratication. Overall,
when fathers are absent from the home, both young boys and young girls (ages 8 to 9 years old) demonstrated
a preference for immediate gratication. Mischel suggests that the inability to delay gratication amongst
children who lack a father may be related to immaturity or poor psychological adjustment (Mischel, 1961).
While Mischel was at Stanford University, he also collaborated with Bandura.

Blending the interests

of both men, they examined whether observing models would aect children's choices regarding immediate
vs. delayed gratication. They identied two groups of children (both boys and girls) as preferring either
immediate gratication (a small candy bar now) or delayed gratication (a larger candy bar later).

The

children were then exposed to either a live model choosing the alternative strategy, a symbolic model (a
description of an adult choosing the alternative), or no model. As expected, exposure to a model choosing
the alternative strategy dramatically aected the behavior of the children, and a live model was more eective
than the symbolic model. The eects of this modeling appeared to be quite persistent (Bandura & Mischel,
1965). Considering the importance that modeling can play in developing the ability to delay gratication, it
is perhaps easy to see why children in families lacking a complete and stable family structure don't develop
self-control as well as other children.

Discussion Question: Mischel's most famous contribution is the concept of delayed gratication. How
good are you at waiting for gratication? Are some rewards easier to wait for than others? If you know
anyone who is signicantly dierent than you, either wanting immediate gratication or being able to delay
it without much trouble, does the dierence between you create any problems or interesting situations?

The Cognitive-Aective Processing System (CAPS)
More recently, Mischel has turned his attention to solving what has been called the  personality paradox: How do we reconcile our intuition and theories that personality is relatively stable with the overwhelming evidence that personality varies across dierent situations?

Mischel proposes a dynamic personality

system that takes into account both: (1) the behavioral consistency that accounts for specic scores on trait
tests and indicates what the individual is like in general; and (2) the consistency in how an individual varies

across dierent situations.

This consistency of variation is recognized by distinct patterns of

if. . .then. . .

relationships, which are characteristic of the individual's overall personality (Mischel, 2004).
In 1995, Mischel and Shoda rst presented this dynamic approach to understanding personality, referring

cognitive-aective
processing system (CAPS; Mischel, 2004; Mischel & Shoda, 1995/2000; Shoda, Leetiernan, & Mischel,
to it then as the cognitive-aective personality system, but now preferring the term

2002). Over a number of years, Mischel, his students, and his colleagues studied children extensively in a
residential summer camp. They observed both behaviors and the situations in which they occurred. Over
time, they were able to identify patterns of

if. . .then. . .

situation-behavior relations that reected distinctive

and stable characteristics of each child's behavior organization. These observations, therefore, gave rise to

situation-behavior proles for each child. It is essential to recognize, however, that the term situation
in these studies does not refer to simple environmental stimuli, as they might for a behaviorist such as
B. F. Skinner. Instead, these situations activate a whole set of internal reactions, including cognitive and
emotional elements.

They are also not limited to the external world; they can be generated in thought,

cognitiveaective units (or CAUs). These CAUs include encodings, expectancies and beliefs, aects, goals and
fantasy, planning, etc. Accordingly, Mischel and Shoda referred to these personality variables as
values, and competencies and self-regulatory plans.
Mischel and Shoda (1995/2000) did not neglect the individual's development in this theory. Our ability
to recognize distinct aspects of the environment are inuenced by genetic/biological factors, cultural factors,
and the interactions between them. These genetic/biological/cultural factors also inuence the CAPS, as
does our social learning history. In a sense, bringing all of these factors together begins to move us beyond
the person-situation debate, since both sides of the debate are correct in the proper context. The future of
personality theory may lie in an as yet undetermined synthesis of these perspectives (Fleeson, 2004). For
now, according to Mischel, this dynamic approach to understanding personality has at least helped to bring
together the major aspects of dierent schools of personality theory:
The two goals - dispositions and dynamics - that have so long been pursued separately do not require
two elds from this perspective. In this theory, dispositions are conceptualized not in semantic terms but as
processing structures characterized by stable cognitive aective organizations in the processing system that
becomes activated when the individual encounters relevant situational features. (pg. 170; Mischel & Shoda,
1995/2000)

The Impact of Social Learning Theory
It would be dicult to overestimate the impact of social learning theory on psychology, because the
human species is so inherently social. Social life seems to come automatically, mediated via mental processes
that are largely unconscious (Bargh & Williams, 2006), and our social norms appear to arise from social
behavior that is adaptive within local ecologies (Kameda, Takezawa, & Hastie, 2005).
note, however, that social organization is by no means unique to the human species.

It is important to
There are many

animal species that live in social groups, some demonstrating a surprising degree of intelligence, suggesting
that social living itself may have helped to foster the development of intelligence (Pennisi, 2006). Further
evidence for the impact of social learning theory on psychology can be found in the simple name recognition
enjoyed by Bandura, certainly one of the most famous psychologists.
There are also interesting lines of research within the eld of neuroscience that provide support for
Mischel and Shoda's cognitive-aective processing system. Utilizing functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI), Decety & Jackson (2006) have found that empathy appears to involve activation of the same brain
regions involved in experiencing the situation about which one is feeling empathy toward another person. For
example, there is signicant activation of brain regions involved in pain when an individual views pictures
of someone else in a clearly painful situation.

This would seem to provide neurobiological evidence in

support of Mischel and Shoda's cognitive-aective units, the functional components of the cognitive-aective
processing system. Similarly, Knoblich & Sebanz (2006) have demonstrated that perceptual, cognitive, and
motor processes are enhanced by social interaction, and that such interactions can be measured using eventrelated potentials that measure brain electrical activity. Some of the data presented in the study by Knoblich
& Sebanz are essentially situation-behavior proles for the individuals in their study.
Finally, let's address the role of expectancy in one of the most challenging social issues facing the world

today: diversity. We hear more and more about the value of diversity in higher education and in the workplace, but pursuing diversity is often challenged by prejudice. Expectations of prejudice enhance attention
to social cues that threaten one's social identity. In other words, when individuals expect that engaging in
diversity will lead to prejudice, and perhaps then to discriminatory behavior, they are more likely to notice
evidence of that very outcome (Kaiser, Vick, & Major, 2006). In addition, contact between diverse groups
does less to displace feelings of prejudice among members of minority groups than it does among members of
the majority group (likely due to the minority group members' recognition of the ongoing eects of prejudice
and discrimination; Tropp & Pettigrew, 2005). These represent dicult situation-behavior circumstances,
since it can obviously be very dicult for team members to predict the behavioral responses likely to follow the articial establishment of diversity.

In making recommendations to the leaders of organizational

teams, Mannix & Neale (2005) suggest clearly dening the team's tasks and goals, providing bridges across
diversity, and enhancing the inuence of the minority. Perhaps most importantly, there is a need to provide
incentives for change. Taken together, these approaches both increase the expectancy of success and raise
the reinforcement value of working toward successfully diversifying the team. As such, principles that have
arisen from social learning theory can clearly play a positive role is reshaping society.

The Future of Psychology: Bandura's Vision as Compared to Freud
In

Toward a Psychology of Human Agency,

Bandura (2006) agrees with Freud that religion played

a signicant role in the advancement of civilization, and that the scientic revolution that began with
Darwin's Theory of Evolution shifted our focus toward natural and scientic approaches to understanding and
improving human life. However, evolution emphasizes random eects on genetically determined structures
and traits, and does not allow for the choices made by individuals, though sociobiologists argue that genetics
can exert inuences on those choices.

Rather than relying on psychoanalysis in order to understand the

impulses of the id that drive us to survive, as Freud proposed (1927/1961, 1930/1961), Bandura believes
that people are agents of change in their own lives, and that they can choose the direction that change takes.
Being an agent involves intentionally inuencing one's functioning and life circumstances, and there are
four core properties of human agency.

Intentionality refers to our ability to form action plans and the
Forethought is the temporal extension of agency, in which

strategies necessary for accomplishing them.

we set goals for ourselves and anticipate likely outcomes of our actions to both guide and motivate our
behavior.

Once having chosen a course of action, of course, we do not simply sit back and wait for the

right things to happen. Agency also involves both

self-reactiveness and self-reectiveness, processes in

which we regulate our behavior, monitor our courses of action, and examine whether we are capable of being
successful in our various endeavors (Bandura, 2006). As much as human agency involves our own thoughts,
goals, motivation, and expectations, however, we do not exist autonomously.

All human behavior occurs

within social structures, and there is a reciprocal interplay between personal, behavioral, and environmental
determinants (reciprocal determinism). This means that human agency, the exercise of self-inuence, is part
of the causal structure of our lives. As Bandura points out, this is not free will, which would be a throwback
to medieval theology, but rather a matter of acting as an agent, the role of an individual in making causal
contributions to the course of events in their life (Bandura, 2006).

. . .Social

cognitive theory rejects a duality of human agency and a disembodied social structure. Social

systems are the product of human activity, and social systems, in turn, help to organize, guide, and regulate
human aairs. However, in the dynamic interplay within the societal rule structures, there is considerable
personal variation in the interpretation of, adoption of, enforcement of, circumvention of, and opposition to
societal prescriptions and sanctions. . .freedom is conceived not just passively as the absence of constraints,
but also proactively as the exercise of self-inuence. . . (pg. 165; Bandura, 2006)

Personality Theory in Real Life: Media Violence
and Its Eects on Children
The second Bobo doll study conducted by Bandura and his colleagues presented videotapes of the models
behaving aggressively toward the Bobo doll (Bandura, Ross, & Ross, 1963a). The observation in this study
that children did, indeed, imitate the aggressive behavior of models seen on lm, but not in person, has
become one the most inuential articles in history, both in terms of stimulating further research on the
modeling of aggression and in terms of practical applications (e.g., ratings on television programs, video

Psychological Science in the
Public Interest (PSPI ) on media violence and its eects on children, Ceci and Bjork (2003) describe how the
authors of this particular PSPI issue were a collection of experts brought together to prepare a portion of the
games, and CDs with controversial lyrics). In their introduction to an issue of

U.S. Surgeon General's report on youth violence. However, political concerns led the Surgeon General's oce
to radically alter the report. The authors protested, and attempted to satisfy the concerns of the politicians.
Ultimately, however, this portion of the report was dropped from the nal version. So, the editors of PSPI
chose to publish this valuable psychological information, which clearly causes political concerns for some, so
that psychologists, psychiatrists, law enforcement ocials, teachers and school administrators, government
policy makers, parents, indeed anyone who has a vested interest in youth violence, might have the most
current information available on the eects of media violence on America's youth.

I would also like to

acknowledge an important point made by the authors themselves. This issue of PSPI was a collaborative
project by eight experts on the eects of media violence. The authors decided that the fairest way to list
their names was alphabetical order. Thus, as I refer to the article as Anderson, et al. (2003), please note
that the et al.

includes widely respected experts, chosen by the National Institute of Mental Health for

this project, each of whom contributed signicantly to this article.
It would be dicult to do justice to this report by summarizing it here, since the report, which is a
review itself, is nearly thirty pages long and cites 245 research studies. Clearly, the attention drawn by this
question, the role of media violence in aecting violent behavior among children, provides a testament to
the signicance of this research. Anderson, et al. (2003) provide an overview of the empirical research, oer
theoretical explanations, they address moderating eects, media use and content, and they examine research
on interventions.
Empirical research on media violence and aggression has covered of wide variety of media types, including
dramatic television and movies, television news violence, music videos and their lyrics, video games, and
the internet. The review of this extensive body of research has shown a statistically signicant association
between exposure to media violence and aggression and violence among youth. Exposure to media violence,
and the ndings are consistent across the various types of media, increases the likelihood that children have
aggressive thoughts and, indeed, engage in aggressive behavior. Most importantly, longitudinal studies have
consistently shown that exposure to media violence in childhood, even beginning in late adolescence, are
predictors of increased aggression and violent behavior in adulthood. Although the eects are at best small
to medium, the authors note that they are as high as other problems that are considered signicant public
health issues, such as cigarette smoking and exposure to asbestos.
Several theories have been put forth to explain the manner in which exposure to media violence increases
aggression in children, not the least of which is Bandura's theory of observational learning. Observational
learning appears to be so important to the humans, and other primate species, that we have developed a
specic neurological system to learn from watching others: the
Craighero, 2004).

mirror-neuron system (see Rizzolatti &

Additional theories suggest that exposure to media violence prepares an individual to

engage in aggressive behavior. This can occur either because the media violence primes the individual by
activating aggressive thoughts and scripts or by generally arousing the individual, and that arousal then
carries over into heightened aggressive behavior in situations that provoke aggressive actions. Finally, there
is the widely used, and often misunderstood, term  desensitization. Anderson et al. (2003) prefer the term

emotional desensitization to refer to a reduction in distress-related reactions to observing or thinking
about violence. Although emotional desensitization may result in an individual being more willing to engage
in aggressive or violent behavior, there is no evidence that it stimulates aggression. Thus, although emotional
desensitization may be related to the disinhibition discussed in the chapter (it may even be the same thing),
its role remains unclear.
Not all children are aected by media violence in the same way, and not all examples of media violence
are equally eective in enhancing aggression. Thus, there must be moderating factors that come into play in
the relationship between exposure to media violence and subsequent aggressive behavior. For example, the
eects of media violence decline as children grow older, media violence is less likely to aect children who
are less aggressive to begin with, and, although there is not a direct eect of intelligence, children of lower
intelligence are more likely to watch television and to be at risk for other factors enhancing aggressiveness.

not been studied in great detail.

However, all of these relationships are complex, and have

Thus, there is much more work to be done.

Finally, one of the most

important moderating factors is parental control. When parents discuss the content of media violence with
their children, when they comment regularly on the reality of violence, children are much less likely to
demonstrate aggressive tendencies.
This entire discussion would be moot, if not for the prevalence of media in our society and the content
of that media. Data reported by Anderson, et al. (2003) from three national surveys provide an amazing
view of media availability in America. Virtually all families with children have a television set, most have
at least one VCR or DVD player, and about three quarters of those families subscribe to cable or satellite
television. Approximately 70 percent of families with children have a video game system and a computer,
and most American children have a television in their room (including 30 percent of children age 0 to 3 years
old!). Watching television is the third most common activity for children, after sleeping and going to school.
A signicant number of children watch more than 40 hours of television a week, and children ages 0 to 6
years spend more time engaged in media entertainment than engaged in reading, being read to, and playing
outside combined! And what's included in that media content? Plenty of violence: 61 percent of programs
contain violence, and only 4 percent of programs contain an anti-violence theme:

. . .put

in another way, 96% of all violent television programs use aggression as a narrative, cinematic

device for simply entertaining the audience. . .Moreover, most aggression on television is glamorized and
trivialized. . .and nearly 75% of all violent scenes feature no immediate punishment or condemnation for
violence. (pg. 101; Anderson, et al., 2003)
Similar ndings have been reported for violence in video games, both in America and in Japan. Parents
seldom recognize the popularity of those violent games, and only about one third of parents even knew the
name of their child's favorite video game (Anderson, et al., 2003).
Despite the wealth of information on the relationship between exposure to media violence and aggressive
behavior, and a number of potential approaches for intervention, there has been little empirical research on
potential interventions. In general, there are three approaches to reducing the inuence of violent media:
changing attitudes to counter violent messages, encouraging parental monitoring and guidance, and providing
education on the content and eects of various forms of media.

But once again, none of these potential

interventions has been studied in detail. It must also be remembered that this is only one of many factors
that contribute to aggressive and violent behavior amongst youth, though it may be the least expensive to
address, since it involves little more than making choices about the media children are exposed to:

. . .However,

the troubling truth is that violent media are entering the home and inviting active partic-

ipation of even very young children - often with little parental supervision. . .Although additional research
to address unresolved questions is needed, it is clear that media violence is a causal risk factor that should
be addressed in thoughtful ways. . .parents can reduce and shape their children's consumption of violent
media. . .from a public-health perspective, today's consumption patterns are far from optimal. And for many
youths, they are clearly harmful. (pgs. 105-106; Anderson, et al., 2003)
Research on this important issue certainly did not end with the publication of the

PSPI

issue in 2003.

In a more recent study, Carnagey and Anderson (2005) had college students play one of three versions
of a race-car video game: one version rewarded all violence, one punished all violence, and one was nonviolent. Overall, rewarding violent actions in the game increased hostile emotion, aggressive thinking, and
aggressive behavior.

In contrast, punishing violence still increased hostile emotion, but did not increase

aggressive thoughts or behaviors. The authors suggest that an important mechanism through which violent
media increases aggressive behavior is to rst increase aggressive thoughts and states of mind.

Another

interesting result in this study was that the non-violent game did not result in as much violence as the
game in which violence was rewarded, suggesting that the violent behavior in the game was not simply the
result of competitiveness by the players. Of course, not everyone responds aggressively when aggression is
modeled.

It appears that individuals who score high on the trait of agreeableness (one of the Big Five

traits, see Chapter 13) are able to short-circuit the eects of aggression-related cues and curb their aggression
(Meier, Robinson, & Wilkowski, 2006). Meier, et al. go on to suggest that teaching other people to associate

aggression-related cues with prosocial behavior might become a valuable intervention in continued eorts to
reduce aggression and violence in our society. First, however, it might prove important to reduce the number
of weapons present in American society (or at least our relationship with them). Klinesmith, Kasser, and
McAndrew (2006) recently demonstrated that when male college students were exposed to a gun there was
an increase in both their testosterone levels and their aggressive behavior. Media violence is clearly not the
only aggression-related cue present for most people. However, as noted above, it may well be one area in
which a distinct reduction in such cues can easily be accomplished without substantial nancial costs (but
certainly with substantial benets) to society.

18.1 Review of Key Points
•

Reciprocal determinism refers to the concept that behavior, personal factors, and environmental factors
are equal, interlocking determinants of each other.

•

Observational learning is a specic type of social learning in which observers view the behavior of
models.

•

Highly aggressive children appear to learn this behavior at home, having experienced their parents
modeling aggressive behavior.

•

When models are rewarded for aggressive behavior, the result can be the disinhibition of aggression
that had previously been restrained.

•

Social learning is dierent than either simple imitation or identication, in that social learning implies
underlying psychological processes (cognition).

•

In order for social learning to occur, conditions must be met that support the components of this
process: attention, retention, production, and motivation.

•

Since observers do not copy behavior perfectly, and since they may choose to mix and match the
behavior of dierent models, observational learning can lead to new and dierent behaviors.

•

Self-regulation refers to the processes of self-reinforcement and self-punishment.

Self-reinforcement

Cognitive Perspectives on Personality

Development

George Kelly's personal construct theory goes beyond the cognitive elements addressed by social learning
theorists and provides a full-edged cognitive theory.

Kelly believed that individuals act very much like

scientists studying personality: they create constructs, or expectations about the environment and people
around them, and then they behave in ways that test those beliefs and expectations.

For Kelly, the

personal constructs are more important than actual reality, since it is the construct that guides cognition
and behavior, not the actual situation.

His theory was unique, and quite unrelated to others that came

before and after. This was, in part, Kelly's very intention:
It is only fair to warn the reader about what may be in store. . .the term
in most psychological texts, scarcely appears at all.
overboard altogether. There is no

learning, so honorably embedded

That is wholly intentional; we are for throwing it

ego, no emotion, no motivation, no reinforcement, no drive, no unconscious,

this will make for periods of strange, and perhaps uncomfortable, reading. Yet, inevitably, a

dierent approach calls for a dierent lexicon... (pg. x; Kelly, 1955a)
Albert Ellis and Aaron Beck are best known for developing therapeutic techniques that are based on
a cognitive perspective of personality and behavior.

Although they are not known for developing actual

theories of personality, their clinical approaches are based on underlying theoretical perspectives, which
shed light on how they view the nature of personality. Thus, their inuential work is naturally connected
to that of Kelly, whose theory of personality was entirely cognitive (as compared to the cognitive social
learning theorists Bandura, Rotter, and Mischel).

More recently, there have been cognitive approaches

to therapy put forth that are connected to much older approaches to human understanding.

Acceptance

and Commitment Therapy (ACT) takes an experiential approach to changing behavior that shares many
similarities to Buddhist approaches (Hayes & Smith, 2005; Hayes, Strosahl, & Wilson, 1999), whereas
Radical Acceptance relies directly on Buddhist teachings to encourage people to embrace their own lives
(Brach, 2003).

Personal Construct Theory
Kelly's personal construct theory departs from cognitive social learning in that he proposes it is not
simply enough to know what a person is likely to do in a given situation, even when your predictions are
correct. More importantly, we need to know what a person might have done (Kelly, 1966). Thus, unlike
the cognitive social learning theorists who consider cognitive processes as an aspect of the environmental
circumstances associated with behavior, Kelly focused on the cognitive constructs rst and foremost.
Kelly presented his personal construct theory in a two volume set, which was published in 1955 (Kelly,
1955a,b). In the mid-1960s Kelly was preparing a new book that was to include talks and papers he had
presented around the world, many of which were never published.

complete this task, but the project was later completed by Brendan Maher (Maher, 1969), thus furthering
the information available on this unique theory.

Brief Biography of George Kelly
Not much is known about George Kelly as a person, particularly regarding his childhood. Later in life
he instructed his wife to destroy all of his personal correspondence. Thus, it has been somewhat dicult to
piece together a picture of how this fascinating individual became the man he was. He was born in 1905 on
a farm near Perth, Kansas. His father had been educated for the Presbyterian ministry, but after getting
married his parents moved to the farm in Kansas, where they had their only child. The Kelly family moved
around from farm to farm, including a failed farm in Colorado on some of the last free land given to settlers
in the West. Kelly's education was erratic, and he learned what he could when the family would occasionally
spend a few weeks in town. He attended four dierent high schools, and apparently never established any
long-term relationships. He was, however, favorably inuenced by the exciting stories told by his maternal
grandfather, who had been the captain of a sailing ship in the North Atlantic (Fransella, 1995).
Despite his erratic education, Kelly attended college at Friends University and then Park College, where
he received a Bachelor's degree in physics and mathematics. Despite studying math and science, the collegiate
debates he experienced had sparked a keen interest in social problems. So, he entered the University of Kansas
to earn a Master's degree in educational sociology, and in 1927 he completed his thesis on the distribution of
leisure time activities of workers in Kansas City. He then moved to Minneapolis and supported himself by
teaching one night a week in each of three dierent night schools. He began studying sociology and biometrics
at the University of Minnesota, but when the university found out that he couldn't pay his tuition he was
told to leave. He was then hired to teach psychology and speech at Sheldon Junior College in Iowa, where
he spent a year and a half.

He then returned to the University of Minnesota for a semester of studying

sociology, but then went back to Wichita, Kansas and worked as an aeronautical engineer for a few months.
He then received an exchange scholar fellowship to study at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, where
he earned a Bachelor's degree in education in 1930, having written his thesis on predicting teaching success.
He then returned to the United States, attended the State University of Iowa, and in 1931 he received a
Ph.D. in psychology, with a focus on reading and speech disabilities.

Two days later he married Gladys

Thompson (Fransella, 1995; Maher, 1969).
As uncharacteristic as it may seem, Kelly nally settled down. He spent the next ten years teaching at
Fort Hays Kansas State College. His research and writings during this time focused on the practical aspects
of providing clinical psychological services for schools. Much like Alfred Adler had in Austria, he developed
traveling clinics to provide training around the state of Kansas, and his model had a dramatic inuence on
the future of rural school psychology. With the advent of World War II, however, Kelly entered the Navy
as an aviation psychologist. At rst he helped to train local civilian pilots, but then he transferred to the
Bureau of Medicine and Surgery of the Navy in Washington to help select naval air cadets. After the war he
spent a year at the University of Maryland, but in 1946 he was appointed Professor and director of Clinical
Psychology at Ohio State University, where he spent the next 20 years (Fransella, 1995; Maher, 1969).
During his rst few years at Ohio State he focused on making their clinical psychology training program
into one of the best in the country. One of his colleagues in the department was Julian Rotter, also known
for his role in shaping the training programs used in psychology today, and one of their students was Walter
Mischel (who admired both Rotter and Kelly).
him famous, the two volume work entitled

Kelly then turned his attention to the theory that made

The Psychology of Personal Constructs

(Kelly, 1955a,b). Kelly's

theory gained immediate recognition as both unique and signicant, and he was invited to teach and lecture
around the United States and in Europe, the Soviet Union, South America, Asia, and the Caribbean. He was
elected president of both the Clinical Division and the Consulting Division of the American Psychological
Association, and he served as president of the American Board of Examiners in Professional Psychology.
In 1965, Kelly left Ohio State for Brandeis University, where he was appointed to the Riklis Chair of
Behavioral Science. He began working on a collection of his papers and lectures from the past decade, but he
died unexpectedly in March, 1966. As mentioned above, that collection of works was completed by the man
who succeeded Kelly as Riklis Professor of Behavioral Science, and was published under the title

Placing Kelly in Context: A Cognitive Theory of Personality
Simply put, Kelly's personal construct theory represents the culmination of the shift from animalistic
behaviorism to humanistic cognition. In American psychology, behaviorism was a powerful force, and began
with the very traditional approach of theorists such as John B. Watson and B. F. Skinner. Alongside the
experimental behaviorists were the learning theorists, such as Clark Hull. As Dollard and Miller tried to
nd some common ground between psychodynamic theory and traditional learning approaches, they were
inevitably led to consider the role of social factors in human learning. Bandura, Rotter, and Mischel built on
the legacy of Dollard and Miller, but added to it the active role of cognition in the human species. Finally,
Kelly moved to a purely cognitive description of how individuals become who they are.
However, we must address an important caveat. Just as Skinner's radical behaviorism was an extreme
position of ignoring cognitive processes, perhaps Kelly's position is equally extreme for attributing signicant
cognitive processing to all aspects of personality and personality development.

Although the man-the-

scientist concept may hold a certain curious appeal for some, who doesn't sometimes knowingly try acting
in dierent ways to see what eect it has on others?

Likewise, who isn't attracted to a theory that says

we desire the ability to both predict and control the events in our lives? However, as Kelly the therapist
was keenly aware, many people cannot predict or control the events surrounding them. Is this always the
result of failed construct systems, or is it possible that sometimes we just aren't thinking? Regardless of the
answer, Kelly is the recognized leader of a signicant development in the eld of personality, a development
that contributed to the highly regarded cognitive therapies of Ellis and Beck.
It is also interesting to note that the basis for his theory of constructive alternativism questions the
reality of the self in a manner similar to Eastern/Buddhist concepts of consciousness and self. Carl Jung was
dramatically inuenced by the ancient Vedic traditions of India, and Carl Rogers, the founder of humanistic
psychology, was inuenced by the spiritual traditions of China.

And now we have Kelly, whose theory

represents the culmination of behavioral-cognitive theories, sharing a fundamental similarity with Buddhist
psychology. Clearly, throughout the history of personality theory, there have been important theorists who
looked beyond the constraints of their own training and their own culture.

Constructive Alternativism
Kelly begins by questioning the role that psychologists have assigned to themselves. Psychologists consider themselves to be scientists, engaged in the systematic study of human behavior and thought. Kelly
questions why we, as psychologists, don't extend the same perspective to all people.

According to Kelly,

doesn't every person seek to predict and control the course of events in their lives? Doesn't every person have
their own theories about situations in life, don't they test their own hypotheses, and weigh the experimental
evidence gained through experience?

. . .it is as though the psychologist were saying to himself, I, being a psychologist, and therefore a scientist,
am performing this experiment in order to improve the prediction and control of certain human phenomena;
but my subject, being merely a human organism, is obviously propelled by inexorable drives welling up
within him, or else he is in gluttonous pursuit of sustenance and shelter. (pg. 5; Kelly, 1955a)
Since Kelly proposes that each individual is theorizing about and testing their own life circumstances,
he suggests the term

man-the-scientist for understanding how all people (including, of course, women)

approach the world around them.
In trying to understand the world around us, using arguments that sound either existential or like Eastern
philosophy, Kelly questions the existence of the universe. Of course it exists, he says, but so do the thoughts
of each individual, and the correspondence between what people think exists and what does, in fact, exist
is constantly changing. Thus, Kelly suggests that it is better to say that the world around us is

existing,

rather than to say it exists. Likewise, life can only be understood in the context of time, if it is to make
sense. However, life is not simply the changes that occur over time. Rather, it is a relationship between
living things and their environment.

Kelly emphasizes the creative capacity of living things to represent

their environment, as opposed to simply reacting to it.

These representations are known as

constructs,

patterns that we create in our mind and attempt to t over the realities of the world. Since our constructs
don't always t with reality, we are constantly modifying them, as well as trying to increase our repertoire of
constructs. Over time, we test our constructs for the ability to predict what will happen in our lives. With

sucient time and experience, and if we are willing to learn from our mistakes, we can evaluate all of our
interpretations of the world in which we live (Kelly, 1955a).
Kelly believes that all of our present interpretations of the environment are open to revision or replacement; there are always alternative constructs that may help us deal with new or dicult situations. It is
this philosophical position that Kelly refers to as

constructive alternativism. It is important to keep

in mind, of course, that not just any alternative will work in a given situation. Therefore, each potential
alternative construct must be evaluated in terms of its specic predictive eciency, as well as in terms of
overall predictive eciency of the system it would become part of, if that alternative construct were adopted
(Kelly, 1955a).

Discussion Question: According to Kelly, it is more important to know what a person might have
done, and he believed that people act as scientists, testing their constructs in order to become better at
predicting and controlling their lives. Can you think of situations in which someone did what you expected,
but you really wanted to know what they had thought about doing as alternatives?

Basic Theory of Personal Constructs
Personal construct theory begins with a

fundamental postulate, which is then elaborated with eleven

corollaries. The fundamental postulate states that  a

(Kelly, 1955a). The carefully chosen words in this postulate dene

emphasize the individuality of this theory,

the unique nature of each person's constructs. Each person is then recognized as a

process.

The mind does not

stop and start, simply reacting to stimuli, but rather it is constantly in motion, constantly experimenting with
constructs. These processes operate through a network of pathways, or

according to the devices,

Since these processes, ways, and channels

have not been identied as specic physiological mechanisms or anatomical structures, Kelly emphasizes
that this is a

psychological

theory. So when we discuss this mechanism we are not necessarily addressing

neuroscience on one hand or sociology on the other hand, we are working within the constraints of the eld
of psychology.
(Kelly, 1955a).

We then have

anticipation,

the push and pull of the psychology of personal constructs

Being man-the-scientist, each of us seeks to predict the future and choose our actions

accordingly. Finally, we have real-life

events.

Kelly was always very practical about both his personality

theory and his approach to psychotherapy. Thus, the psychology of personal constructs is not an ethereal
theory.

Psychological processes, according to Kelly, are tied down to reality, and anticipation is carried

forward in order to better represent future reality. Having established the fundamental postulate, Kelly then
described eleven corollaries, or propositions, which both follow from the postulate and amplify his system
by elaborating on the fundamental idea (Kelly, 1955a).

Construction Corollary:

A person anticipates events by construing their replications.

Construing

refers to placing an interpretation upon an event. Since a new event will not occur exactly as a past event,
our anticipation involves interpreting what the new event will be like.

Kelly uses the example of a day.

Today is not the same as yesterday, tomorrow will not be the same as today, but each day follows something
of a similar pattern. Thus, our anticipation of tomorrow involves constructs based on both the similarities
and dierences between days we have experienced in the past. It is important to note that this process is
not the same as cognition, it is not simply thinking about tomorrow. Much of this process is preverbal, or
unconscious, and in that sense occurs automatically.

Individuality Corollary:

Persons dier from each other in their construction of events.

No matter how

closely associated two people are, they cannot play exactly the same role in any situation. Therefore, they
will interpret events dierently. Although Kelly acknowledges that people often share similar experiences,
particularly as they attend to the experiences of others in the same or similar situations, this corollary
emphasizes the unique, subjective nature of interpreting and anticipating events.

Organization Corollary: Each person characteristically evolves, for his convenience in anticipating
events, a construction system embracing ordinal relationships between constructs. When faced with conict,
there may be solutions that contradict one another. Thus, the constructs we develop may contradict each
other. Kelly suggested that we develop our constructs in a systematic and organized way, with some constructs being ranked more highly than others. For example, some constructs may be good vs. bad, or stupid

419

vs. intelligent. A stupid construct might work in a given solution, but an intelligent one would probably be
preferred. For instance, suppose you have an electric garage door opener, and the power is out. You could
put your car in the garage by driving through the garage door. However, it might be preferable to get out
of the car, go into the garage through the house or side door, and then disconnect the garage door from the
opener and open it by hand.

Dichotomy Corollary:

constructs.

A person's construction system is composed of a nite number of dichotomous

Every construct has both positive and negative aspects. In the example used above, both ways

of putting your car in the garage have advantages and disadvantage. Driving through the garage door is
quick and easy in the short term, but results in needing a new garage door.

Getting out of the car and

using another entrance takes more time and eort, and may be unpleasant in a bad storm, but it protects
your property (and saves time and money in the long run). The essential nature of contrast was eloquently
described some 2,600 years ago by Lao Tsu:
Under Heaven all can see beauty as beauty only because there is ugliness.
All can know good as good only because there is evil.
Therefore having and not having arise together.
Dicult and easy complement each other.
Long and short contrast each other;
High and low rest upon each other;
Voice and sound harmonize each other;
Front and back follow one another.
Lao Tsu, c600 B.C.
(pg. 4; Lao Tsu, c600 B.C./1989)

Choice Corollary: A person chooses for himself that alternative in a dichotomized construct through
which he anticipates the greater possibility for extension and denition of his system. Simply put, since each
situation requires us to choose between the options we construct, Kelly believed we choose the alternative
that serves us best (at least within our system of constructs, which may be dierent than the reality of the
best choice). But what about situations in which the best choice is not so obvious? Kelly believed that the
choice corollary allowed for shades of gray when a decision is not clearly a choice between black and white
alternatives. He did not view this as a contradiction, but rather, he proposed that the choice becomes one
between options that are more gray or less gray. Thus, we can maintain the dichotomy of the choice while
still also allowing the choice itself.

Range Corollary:

A construct is convenient for the anticipation of a nite range of events only.

may apply well to descriptions of people, trees, and buildings. But what would

we mean by tall weather, or short light? Clearly, the construct

discrete, physical objects.

Experience Corollary:

tions of events.

A person's construction system varies as he successively construes the replica-

As we apply constructs in our eorts to predict what happens in our lives, we sometimes

experience unexpected outcomes. As a result, we reconstruct our constructs, and learn from our experiences.
In other words, man-the-scientist is by denition a work in process, and that process is ongoing.

Modulation Corollary: The variation in a person's construction system is limited by the permeability
of the constructs within whose range of convenience the variants lie. This corollary addresses the ease with
which the experience corollary can occur. Although all individuals modify the constructs that guide their
anticipation of events, some constructs are modied more easily, and some people are more open to changing
their perspectives (and, hence, reconstructing their constructs). This is one area where Kelly re-emphasizes
the dierence between psychological processes and the process of science. Scientists seek hypotheses, theories,
and laws that are not likely to change. Indeed, there is a continuum from hypothesis to law based on how
likely it is that a scientic observation is true. People, however, are constantly testing and retesting their
constructs, and reconstructing them as necessary and appropriate. Therefore, people may act like scientists,
but their psychological processes serve to facilitate the individual's life, not the lives of others (as scientic
theories and laws are meant to apply to the whole universe).

DEVELOPMENT

420

Fragmentation Corollary: A person may successively employ a variety of construction subsystems
which are inferentially incompatible with each other. This corollary extends from the previous one, but with
a twist. As an individual encounters unexpected events, they modify their constructs to the extent that they
are able. Thus, their behavior may change slowly, or more quickly, depending on the nature of the constructs
that guide their openness to change. The twist comes into play when individuals are either resisting change,
or in the process of change, and it involves the dichotomy corollary. If an individual is failing to predict and
control events in their life, they may choose an incompatible construct, essentially reversing the course of
their behavior. One of the advantages of Kelly's personal construct theory is that these dramatic changes in
behavior can now be seen as reasonable progressions in one's ongoing desire for predictability and control.

Commonality Corollary: To the extent that one person employs a construction of experience which
is similar to that employed by another, his psychological processes are similar to those of the other person.
This corollary is important for interpersonal relations. Even though two people cannot experience the same
event in exactly the same way, their ability to share their experiences is facilitated by the similarity of
their experiences. This raises important implications for therapists working with clients of dierent cultures,
since they might not share similar constructs based on certain events. It also raises an important distinction
between cognitive and behavioral approaches to understanding personality. In behavioral perspectives, simple
stimulus-response relationships are the same for everyone who experiences them. However, in the cognitive
perspective, each person necessarily experiences any event in a unique way.

Sociality Corollary: To the extent that one person construes the construction processes of another, he
may play a role in a social process involving the other person. Humans are social creatures. Our ability to
predict and control our lives is largely based on our ability to predict and either control or work with other
people. Thus, it is important for individuals to construe to thoughts and behaviors of others, and in so doing
we can each play a role in the lives of others. Kelly suggests that this provides a natural connection between
personal construct theory and social psychology, as well as a connection between personal construct theory
and cross-cultural psychology.

Dimensions of Transition
Since life is an ongoing process, there are regular transitions in one's personal constructs. According to
the organizational and modulation corollaries, individuals have certain preferences amongst their constructs
and dierences in their ability to reconstruct them. Problems in life arise when individuals nd it dicult
to transition from an ineective construct, one that does not allow for predicting or controlling events, to an
eective construct. According to Kelly (1955a), the major problems are seen as the psychological phenomena
of

threat, fear, guilt, and anxiety. Kelly denes these terms as follows:

Threat is the awareness of imminent comprehensive change in one's core structures.
Fear is like threat, except that, in this case, it is a new incidental construct, rather than a comprehensive
construct, that seems about to take over.
Perception of one's apparent dislodgment from his core role structure constitutes the experience of guilt.
Anxiety is the recognition that the events with which one is confronted lie outside the range of convenience
of one's construct system.
In each case, the psychological phenomenon is based on either the failure of one's constructs to provide
courses of action or a direct challenge to the system of constructs available to the individual. Given that the
individual's personal construct systems dene the larger construct of self, these psychological phenomena
represent a challenge to the very self experiencing them. In defense of the individual, aggressiveness is seen
as

the active elaboration of one's perceptual eld.

In other words, aggressive individuals try to control events

in ways that force decisions favorable to the individual. Similarly, hostility is viewed as

In this case, the individual tries to nd conrmation of success following failed constructs, and this can only
be done at the expense of others (Kelly, 1955a).
As people live their everyday lives, there are two typical cycles of transition, the C-P-C Cycle and the
Creativity Cycle. The C-P-C Cycle involves circumspection, preemption, and control. Being circumspect
refers to being wary, not taking risks. Thus, as we construe events we try to be precise in the development
of our constructs. We then preempt these constructs for membership in an exclusive realm, one that best

421

ts the event we are trying to predict and control. Finally, the rst two steps have control as their natural
consequence.

Still, the individual must make the choice of that course of action, so Kelly suggests that

the nal C could just as well stand for choice as it does for control.

In contrast, the Creativity Cycle

begins with loose constructions, and then leads to tightened and validated constructions. What makes the
Creativity Cycle meaningful is the individual's ability to quickly experiment with various constructs and
then seize upon the most promising, which is then tightened up and tested. Since much of this process is
preverbal, the thought processes of creative individuals may not be apparent to others. According to Kelly,
although individuals who begin with tight constructions might be productive, they cannot be creative.
Creativity requires beginning with loose constructions (Kelly, 1955a). The value of creativity is not simply
to be found as a distinction between the types of cycles experienced by individuals in their daily lives.
Creativity is an important component of well-being, and a common topic in books on positive psychology
and human strengths and virtues (Aspinwall & Staudinger, 2003; Cloninger, 2004; Compton, 2005; Peterson
& Seligman, 2004; Snyder & Lopez, 2005). Indeed, Carl Rogers identied creativity as a signicant aspect
of the personality of a fully functioning person (Rogers, 1961).

Discussion Question: Many psychologists, including Kelly and Carl Rogers, consider creativity to be
an essential aspect of healthy psychological development. Have you ever entered into an unfamiliar situation
and tried to be creative in how you handled it? Was it dicult to set aside preconceived notions about how
to act, or do you nd it easy to try dierent things in new situations?

The Role of the Psychotherapist
Kelly was rst and foremost a clinical psychologist, and his writings are full of practical examples related
to clinical work. Theories are of little value unless they are rooted in the values of the psychologists using
them. Kelly considered this to be particularly true of clinical psychologists, since they are routinely dealing
with clients (Kelly, 1955b). Kelly believed that the role of the psychotherapist involves not only the training
and perspectives of the therapist, but also a need to understand the client, and essential ethical considerations:
The role of the psychotherapist involves keen alertness to what the client expects from psychotherapy
and the initial acceptance of a wide variety of client misperceptions of what psychotherapy is. . .it involves
certain ethical obligations that transcend mere legal status. (pg. 618; Kelly, 1955b)
In his typically practical style, Kelly provides lengthy lists of what psychotherapy means to the client, the
client's conceptualization of the therapist, the clinician's conceptualization of their role, and basic approaches
to revising the client's constructs. At the beginning of therapy, it is unlikely that the client has a good concept
of what therapy is and what it can accomplish. Nonetheless, the client has some construction of what will
take place in therapy. The complaint presented by the client says something about what he or she thinks
therapy can accomplish, and some see therapy as an end in itself. However, the reality is that therapy is
a means to an end, and that end should be generating movement forward on the part of the client.

In

contrast, some clients are so ready for change that the therapist must be cautious in interpreting the client's
state of mind (Kelly, 1955b).

Just as the client makes predictions about therapy, they will also have an

initial conceptualization of the therapist. They may construe the therapist as a parent, an absolver of guilt,
a companion, or even a threat.

Hopefully, according to Kelly, the client may construe the therapist as a

representative of reality. In this case, the client may feel free to experiment with his or her constructs without
fear of failure. Most importantly, how the client construes the therapist will have a dramatic eect on their
relationship:
From the client's conceptualization of psychotherapy comes the role he expects to play and the role he
expects the therapist to play. . .He may be bitterly disappointed in the therapist's enactment of the expected
role. He may stretch his perceptions of the therapist in order to construe him in the manner he expected to
construe him rather than in the manner the therapist seeks to be construed. . ..The client may then feel lost
and insecure in the psychotherapeutic relationship. (pg. 575; Kelly, 1955b)
As the client is engaging in these processes, the clinician is also conceptualizing their own role. Overall,
the goal of any therapist should be to assist in the continuous reconstruction of the client's construct system,
and the changes that take place in therapy should set the stage for continued reconstruction after therapy
has been discontinued. Initially, the therapist may rely on a variety of techniques to accomplish supercial
reconstructions. The therapist needs to be patient, and initially must accept the client's construct systems

as they are.

The latter point is quite similar to the empathy described by Carl Rogers in humanistic,

client-centered therapy, and Kelly does indeed use the word empathize in his own writings. As therapy
progresses, the therapist needs to help the client select new conceptual elements, accelerate the tempo of
the client's experience, and design and implement experiments. Finally, the therapist serves to validate the
client's experiments as they attempt to reconstruct their construct systems (Kelly, 1955b).

Psychological Assessment within Personal Construct Theory
Kelly believed that therapy was a joint eort between the therapist and the client, and since the goal was
the ongoing reconstruction of the client's psychological systems (even after therapy), the client ultimately
needs to become his own therapist. Therefore, the

psychotherapeutic interview (Note: by interview,

Kelly means what we would commonly call a therapy session) becomes an essential part of therapy. Throughout the process of the interview, the therapist makes decisions regarding the course of the interchange between
the therapist and the client. Overall, the decisions made by the therapist are tailored to the specic client,
but still the therapist must remain in control of the interview. This requires that the therapist plan for the
interview. Those plans include how often to interview the client, how long the interviews should last, the
tempo of the interview, and when to terminate the interview.

Since the client continues to live their life

outside of the interview room, the therapist must also consider whether special circumstances will require
special interview plans (Kelly, 1955b, 1958). One of the most practical aspects of the interview is that the
client can simply provide information needed by the therapist, to a point:

. . .there

is a useful adage for clinical psychologists to follow on occasion: if you do not know what is

wrong with a person, ask him; he may tell you. (pp. 322; Kelly, 1955a)

Role Construct Repertory Test (Rep Test) was developed by Kelly in order to understand

A more organized form of the Rep Test,

Repertory Grid. Once again the client is

asked to identify signicant people in their life. The grid provides three-person pairings that address various
relational factors (family, intimate friends, conicted relationships, authority gures, and values), and as
before the client provides a construct that associates two of the people yet distinguishes them from the third.
The common factor is listed as the

emergent pole, the distinguishing factor is listed as the implicit pole.

The Rep Test does not result in specic outcomes, so its interpretation is also subject to dierent methods.
If the Rep Test is interpreted formally, it will provide results on the number and range of constructs present
within the client's construct systems. In the hands of an experienced and skilled examiner, information can
be gleaned on the equivalence of constructs, thus providing deeper detail on the eective range of the client's
construct system. As more information is obtained from the Rep Test, the better able the therapist will be
to guide the therapeutic process (Kelly, 1955a).

Fixed-role therapy is a technique derived from personal construct theory. First, the client prepares a
self-characterization sketch, a technique in which the client is asked to write a character sketch about
themselves as if they were the principal character in a play, but written as if by a friend who knows the
client well. Using information from the self-characterization sketch, as well as from interviews and perhaps
the Rep Test, the therapist then writes a

xed-role sketch. The client is asked to act out the xed-role

sketch over a period of weeks. Initially, Kelly and his colleagues emphasized minor changes in the client's
construct systems. However, they later found that it is often easier for a client to play out roles that are
the opposite of their usual constructs, rather than making only minor changes in their behavior. Over time,
it is expected that the client will learn that the new construct systems are more predictive than their old
construct systems, and the xed-role therapy will establish an ongoing process of reconstruction within the
client (Kelly, 1955a).

Discussion Question: Kelly's xed-role therapy requires the client to write a script for how they want
to live their life. He found that sometimes it was easier for his clients to act out the opposite of their typical
behavior.

Would you nd it easier to make minor changes in your behavior, or easier to make dramatic

changes?

Connections Across Cultures: Understanding Culture's Eects on
Cognitive Style as a Prerequisite for Eective Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy
An essential element of all cognitive therapies is the desire to identify and challenge a client's underlying dysfunctional cognitions, whether they are mistaken beliefs, schemas, automatic thoughts, cognitive
distortions, whatever the case may be.

To do so, requires that the therapist knows when cognitions are

dysfunctional, and to some extent, what would be a reasonable cognition in the client's personal situation.
While it may seem obvious that any psychologically healthy person, particularly a trained therapist, would
be able to recognize the dierence between functional and dysfunctional thoughts, feelings, and behaviors,
this assumes that the therapist and the client come from similar environments. This may very well NOT
be the case when the client and the therapist come from dramatically dierent cultures. Furthermore, as
G. Morris Carstairs noted regarding psychiatric interviews (1961), it makes a signicant dierence whether
it is the therapist or the client who is outside of their familiar culture. For example, when a psychologist
conducts research in a foreign country, particularly in small towns or villages, local people may simply fear
and avoid strangers.
Kelly discussed culture at length in

The Psychology of Personal Constructs

(Kelly, 1955a,b). Both the

commonality corollary and the sociality corollary are directly inuenced by our understanding of culture. We,
and by we I mean to include therapists, tend to expect that people from similar cultures have experienced
basically similar upbringings and environments. We also tend to believe that people from a given culture
share their expectations regarding the behavior of others from that culture. Thus, in order for a therapist
to gain access to the personal constructs of their client, it is important for the therapist to learn as much
as possible about the client's cultural heritage. Failure to do so may interfere with the therapist's ability to
understand some of the client's disruptive anxieties about either therapy itself or their life in general. Indeed,
Kelly shares an example in which a White therapist (whom Kelly was supervising) found it dicult to help a
Black client, because the Black client was overly anxious about discussing racially charged feelings regarding
interracial sexual relationships. Since the client had discussed sexual issues before, the White therapist did
not readily recognize the discomfort with which the Black client addressed his attraction to White women
(remember, this was in the 1950s!).
Kelly goes on to discuss cultural dierences in mannerisms, language, expectations regarding mental
illness, the inuence of religion, and how a therapist might go about learning more about a client's cultural
experiences.

He does caution, however, that one should not attribute too much value to the inuence of

culture:

. . .It

is important that the clinician be aware of cultural variations. Yet, from our theoretical view, we

look upon the inuence of culture in the same way as we look upon other events. The client is not merely

the product of his culture, but it has undoubtedly provided him with much evidence of what is true and
much of the data which his personal construct system has had to keep in systematic order. (pg. 688; Kelly,
1955b)
For example, it is often considered the mark of a sophisticated clinician that he considers all of his clients
in terms of the culture groups to which they belong. Yet, in the nal analysis, a client who is to be genuinely
understood should never be conned to the stereotype of his culture. (pg. 833; Kelly, 1955b)
Albert Ellis and Aaron Beck, originators of the best known cognitive-behavioral therapies (see Beck &
Weishaar, 1995; Ellis, 1995), also discussed cultural inuences, though not as extensively as Kelly had. Ellis
emphasized that each individual develops a belief system which helps them make judgments and evaluate
situations.

Although each person's belief system is unique, they share many beliefs with other members

of their society and/or culture. Perhaps more importantly, dierent cultures can have very dierent belief
systems. To complicate the situation even further, cultural beliefs can change, either due to gradual evolution
of the culture or in a more dramatic fashion when an inuential thinker or leader oers a dierent perspective
on life (Ellis, 1977). Beck has discussed how culturally-determined schemas can be so fundamental that they
contribute to how and who we both love and hate (Beck, 1988, 1999).
Today, studies on the relationship between culture and cognition continue, both in clinical and nonclinical settings. There are at least two handbooks focusing on cross-cultural and multicultural factors in
personality assessment (Dana, 2000; Suzuki, Ponterotto, & Meller, 2001). According to Suzuki, et al. (2001),
these handbooks are necessary due to the growing number of racial and ethnic minorities in the United States
and in recognition of the multitude of variables that aect performance on cognitive and personality tests. . .
As assessment transitions to therapy, it becomes quite a challenge for any therapist to be familiar with the
wide variety of cultures in America.

Axelson (1999) has identied six basic cultural groups in America:

native Americans, Anglo-Americans, European ethnic Americans, African Americans, Hispanic Americans,
and Asian Americans. This list obviously does not include the many immigrants living in this country who
are not considered to be American. When faced with such cross-cultural challenges, the essential skills for a
therapist include careful and active listening, genuine verbal and nonverbal responses that indicate successful
communication, being honest about what you do not understand, respecting and caring about the client,
and being patient and optimistic (Axelson, 1999).
Additional studies have suggested that cultural knowledge inuences the interpretation of stimuli in a
dynamic, constructivist fashion (Hong, Morris, Chiu, & Benet-Martinez, 2000), that these processes occur
automatically (Bargh & Williams, 2006), and that experiencing a wider variety of cultures in one's education may actually lead to more complex cognitive processing (Antonio, Chang, Hakuta, Kenny, Levin, &
Milem, 2004). When considering fundamental cultural dierences, what some consider the

core values that

distinguish amongst cultures, most psychology students are familiar with the distinction between individualistic and collectivistic cultures (cultures in which one favors one's own goals as compared to subordinating
one's own goals in favor of group goals).

However, Laungani (1999) suggests that there are three other

common dimensions: free will vs. determinism, materialism vs. spiritualism, and cognitivism vs. emotionalism. According to Laungani, Western cultures tend to be work- and activity-centered. Thus, they operate
in a cognitive mode that emphasizes rational, logical, and controlled thought and behavior. Non-Western
cultures, in contrast, tend to be relationship-centered, operating in an emotional mode.

Public displays

of feelings and emotions, both positive and negative, are not frowned upon (Laungani, 1999). These core
values carry over into cognitive styles.

For example, the cognitive style prevalent in Africa tends toward

synthesis, as opposed to analysis. Africans tend to integrate their experiences into an inclusive whole, and
they view such tendencies as more natural than the typical Western alternative (Okeke, Draguns, Sheku,
& Allen, 1999). Thus, one can imagine a therapeutic situation in which the client resists analyzing their
problems, and the therapist considers that resistance to be a specic problem unique to the client.

Any

subsequent attempts by the therapist to break down that resistance would be awed, since the therapist has
not understood the underlying cognitive style of the client. The failure of therapists to properly address the
signicance of cultural factors in therapy, regardless of whether or not their failure was unintentional, has

cultural malpractice (Iijima Hall, 1997).

Albert Ellis and Aaron Beck are not known as personality theorists, but both are well-known therapists
and prolic authors. Their unique approaches to therapy are, of course, based on their theoretical perspectives, each of which emphasizes cognitive processes. Thus, we will take a brief look at how they have applied
cognitive aspects of personality theory to the treatment of psychological disorders.
Pretzer and Beck (2005) have suggested that cognitive therapies are truly integrative approaches that
treat the individual within a

phenomenological perspective.

Beck was trained as psychoanalyst, and

began examining his patients' thought processes carefully in an attempt to prove that Freud was right about
depression being the result of anger turned inward.

However, Beck instead discovered that his patient's

thoughts focused more on themes such as despair and defeat, and that their appraisals of situations in life
and their consistently negative biases in processing information were better predictors of their mood and
behavior. Thus, Beck began to develop a cognitive approach to working with his patients. At the same time
Ellis was developing rational-emotive therapy, and the two theories have inuenced each other in many ways
(Pretzer & Beck, 2005).

In addition, cognitive therapy has been inuenced by many other developments

in the eld of psychology, including the work of Freud, Adler, Horney, Rogers, Bandura, and, of course,
Kelly. The integration of these various approaches, in order to truly understand the individual, requires the
therapist to work actively with the client:

. . .The

idea of collaborative empiricism is central to the practice of cognitive therapy. In the course

of therapy, the cognitive therapist works with his or her client to collect detailed information regarding
the specic thoughts, feelings, and actions that occur in problem situations. These observations are used
as a basis for developing an individualized understanding of the client which provides a basis for strategic
intervention. . .For the cognitive therapist to intervene eectively, he or she must endeavor both to understand
the individual's subjective experience and to perceive objective reality accurately.

(pp.

46-47; Pretzer &

Beck, 2005)
More recent developments in cognitive therapy have focused on accepting the circumstances of one's

Acceptance
and Commitment Therapy (ACT) acknowledges the presence of suering in human life, and focuses on

life, doing so not as an excuse, but in order to facilitate moving forward from that point.

using mindfulness to re-orient one's relational framework to the circumstances of one's life (Eifert & Forsyth,
2005; Hayes & Smith, 2005; Hayes, Strosahl, & Wilson, 1999). ACT has many elements in common with
the traditional practice of Buddhist mindfulness, an approach that is taken directly in Radical Acceptance
(Brach, 2003).

Brief Biographies of Albert Ellis and Aaron Beck
Albert Ellis was born in 1913 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. When he was 4 years old his family moved
to New York City, and Ellis has remained there ever since. Although Ellis considered his childhood to have
had no signicant eect on his subsequent career in psychology, there were some rather dramatic factors
that inuenced the person he became. His father was a traveling salesman who was seldom home, and when
he was home he paid little attention to his children. After his parents were divorced, Ellis seldom saw his
father again. His mother wasn't much more attentive, doing very little for the children, and often leaving
them home alone. Ellis later wrote: As for my nice Jewish mother, a hell of a lot of help she was! (cited
in Yankura & Dryden, 1994). Ellis was also very sick following tonsillitis and a strep infection. He needed
emergency surgery, and then developed nephritis.

Over the next 2 years, from 5 to 7 years old, he was

hospitalized eight times, once for 10 months. Yet his parents remained uncaring, and he would sometimes go
weeks without anyone from the family visiting him in the hospital. The illness kept him from playing sports
or other games even when he was home from the hospital. Perhaps as a result of all of these circumstances,
or perhaps because of his temperament, Ellis was painfully shy. He dreaded public activities, such as when
he won an award for his excellent academic work, and he avoided making social overtures toward any girl he
had a crush on (Yankura & Dryden, 1994).
Surprisingly, Ellis grew strong from these experiences. He thrived on his independence and autonomy,
and turned his attention toward his schoolwork.

He obtained praise from adults other than his parents,

and at one point became something of a leader amongst the children in the hospital. Although his shyness
plagued him for many years, he developed a strong sense of self-esteem based on his success in academics.
Most importantly, he developed a sense of choosing to overcome his adverse childhood. He did not become a

strong-willed individual because of his bad childhood, for example he describes his sister as never really being
happy, but in spite of it, due largely to being born with an innate capacity for rational thinking (Yankura
& Dryden, 1994).
Much like B. F. Skinner, Ellis hoped to become a writer. Having nished high school at the age of 16,
he decided to attend business school at the City College of New York so he might make enough money to
support his writing career. However, the Great Depression was just beginning, so there was little opportunity
for a young man to make money in business. Nonetheless, he wrote a great deal. He wrote a 500,000-word
autobiographical novel. By the age of 28 he had written twenty full-length novels, plays, and books of poetry.
None of them were published. He also wrote numerous non-ction works on sex, philosophy, and politics.
None of them were published. However, his research on the topics of sex, love, and marriage made him a
popular source of advice amongst his friends. And so he decided to pursue professional training in psychology
(Yankura & Dryden, 1994).
Ellis began his studies in the psychology program at Columbia University, and then transferred to the clinical psychology program at Teachers College of Columbia University, receiving a Ph.D. in clinical psychology
in 1947. That year he also began training as a psychoanalyst at the Karen Horney Institute for Psychoanalysis. His training analyst was Dr. Charles Hulbeck, who had been analyzed by Hermann Rorschach. One of
the personal issues Ellis addressed during his training analysis was whether or not to marry the women he
had begun dating. He eventually decided not to marry her (he was later married twice, one marriage ended
in annulment, the other in divorce).

Ellis was successful as a psychoanalyst, but many patients couldn't

aord to come as often as was recommended in traditional psychoanalytic theory. Curiously, Ellis noticed
that patients who came less often seemed to fare better in therapy, especially when the constraints of limited
time caused Ellis to be more proactive in therapy. He pursued this active-directive approach to therapy, and
by the mid-1950s he had developed rational emotive behavior therapy to the point where he published his
rst articles and began describing the technique at professional conferences (Yankura & Dryden, 1994).
Ellis devoted the rest of his career to establishing rational emotive behavior therapy as a signicant force
in psychotherapy.

In 1959 he established the Institute for Rational Living, and by the 1980s there were

similar institutes in Australia, Britain, Canada, Germany, Israel, Italy, Mexico, and the Netherlands. He has
written over 75 books, beginning with

How to Live with a Neurotic

(Ellis, 1957), hundreds of articles, and he

has received many distinguished awards. After 60 years as a psychotherapist, marriage and family counselor,
and sex therapist, Ellis has been honored as a fellow of ve major associations.

He was recognized with

Humanist of the Year Award by the American Humanist Association, the Distinguished Psychologist
Award of the Academy of Psychologists in Marital and Family Therapy, the Distinguished Practitioner Award

the

of the American Association of Sex Educators, Counselors and Therapists, and the American Psychological
Association has recognized him for

Distinguished Professional Contributions to Knowledge.

In a 1991 survey

ranking the Most Inuential Psychotherapist, Canadian psychologists ranked Ellis #1, whereas American
psychologists ranked him second to Carl Rogers, but ahead of third-place Sigmund Freud (Ellis, 1994, 2005;
Yankura & Dryden, 1994)!
In most ways, Aaron Beck's childhood couldn't have been more dierent than that of Ellis.

Born in

1921, he was the youngest child of loving and supportive parents. His parents were particularly supportive of
education: his brother Irving became a physician, and his brother Maurice entered social work after earning
a Master's degree in psychology (the other two children had died in childhood, his only sister dying in the
worldwide inuenza epidemic of 1919).

Like Ellis, however, Beck was extremely ill as a child.

When he

was seven years old, Beck broke his arm at a playground. An infection set in, which then developed into
septicemia (a generalized blood infection).

At the time, septicemia was 90 percent fatal, and his brother

Irving overheard the doctor tell their mother that Beck would die.

Although he obviously survived, he

missed so much school that he had to be held back a year. As often happens when young children are held
back in school, the eect on his self-esteem was devastating, and Beck came to believe that he was stupid
and inept (Weishaar, 1993; for more information on the negative eects of grade retention visit the National
Association of School Psychologists' website at www.nasponline.org).
However, with the help of his brothers, Beck was able to catch up to and eventually surpass his classmates,
graduating rst in his high school class. Along the way he belonged to the Audubon Society, worked as a

camp counselor, became the youngest Eagle Scout in his Boy Scout troop, and was editor of the high school
newspaper. He followed his brothers to Brown University, but was unsure of a career path. He majored in
English and Political Science, but he took a wide variety of courses, eventually taking the courses necessary
to go on to medical school. He graduated
and essay writing.

magna cum laude,

Phi Beta Kappa, and won awards for oratory

Despite his dramatic successes, Beck suered a great deal of anxiety, particularly a

blood/injury phobia that most likely resulted from his frightening experiences related to the emergency
surgery necessary when he broke his arm. Having been accepted to the Yale School of Medicine, his surgery
rotation was very dicult in light of his fear of blood. However, he worked through his fears cognitively (an
obvious foreshadowing of the work that would make him famous), and successfully completed his medical
degree (Weishaar, 1993).
Beck never intended to study psychiatry, and thought little of psychoanalysis. However, having graduated
in 1946, there were many veterans returning from World War II. In 1949, he began a residency in neurology at
a veteran's administration hospital in Massachusetts. Due to a pressing need for psychiatrists, the director
of the program began requiring everyone to complete a rotation is psychiatry.

The psychiatry program

at the hospital was primarily inuenced by the Boston Psychoanalytic Institute, and Beck protested that
psychoanalytic formulations seemed far-fetched, but he eventually decided to stay in psychiatry and to study
psychoanalysis in greater detail. He rst studied psychoanalysis at the Austin Riggs Center in Massachusetts,
where one of his supervisors was Erik Erikson. After completing his training in psychiatry, he joined the
faculty of the University of Pennsylvania Medical School (in 1954), where he has remained ever since. As
he began his research career, Beck intended to conrm Freud's hypothesis that depression was the result
of hostility turned inward.

However, he began to recognize that his patients were greatly inuenced by

underlying patterns of cognition, the so-called automatic thoughts that are so well-known today. About this
same time, Beck learned of Kelly's work on personal constructs (which Beck later referred to as schemas).
As a result of these ideas and experiences coming together, Beck's own cognitive theory began to take shape.
Then, in 1963, Ellis read an article written by Beck. Ellis sent copies of his own work to Beck, and reprinted
Beck's article in the journal

Rational Living.

Beck then invited Ellis to speak to the psychiatry residents at

Penn, and from that point forward the two maintained close contact. Beck has credited Ellis as being an
excellent spokesperson for cognitive approaches to psychotherapy (Weishaar, 1993).
During his career, Beck has received many awards, including the

the Applications of Psychology

Distinguished Scientic Award for

from the American Psychological Association. He has also received major

awards from the American Psychiatric Association, the American Psychopathological Association, and the
American Association of Suicidology. He received an honorary doctorate in medical science from his alma
mater, Brown University, in 1987 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal College of Psychiatrists (England),
and he is a senior member of the Institute of Medicine.

Perhaps the most meaningful tribute, however,

is that his daughter, Dr. Judith Beck, has followed in his footsteps. She is currently the Director of the
Beck Institute for Cognitive Therapy and Research, and a Clinical Associate Professor at the University of
Pennsylvania. She has written a number of books on cognitive therapy and, with her father, developed the

Placing Ellis and Beck in Context: Cognitive Therapy
In one sense, Ellis and Beck do not belong in a book about personality theory.

They are not known

for their theoretical contributions to our understanding of personality development. In another sense, they
are among the most important theorists covered, since the practical application of cognitive theories to
psychotherapy has had a dramatic inuence on the eectiveness of psychotherapy in treating psychological
disorders. Remember that Freud, as well as most of the other well-known psychodynamic theorists, began
conducting therapy rst and later developed theoretical perspectives which helped to explain what they saw
in their patients and what worked in therapy. Similarly, Ellis and Beck focused on the development of their
therapeutic approaches, and to a large extent their theoretical perspective is inferred from the techniques
they use in therapy.
In addition, one could argue that the cognitive therapies of Ellis and Beck stand at the pinnacle of the
behavioral and cognitive theories of personality that have been so inuential in American psychology. As

evidence of their signicance, Beck received an Albert Lasker Clinical Medical Research Award in 2006.
Often called the American Nobel Prize (some seventy recipients have gone on to win a Nobel Prize), in the
60 years that the Lasker prizes have been awarded, Beck is the rst psychotherapist to be honored. This
award is a testament both to the respect that cognitive psychotherapy has earned in the medical community
and to Beck for the honor he has earned amongst many ground-breaking psychotherapists.
Although cognitive therapies may seem highly specialized, both Ellis and Beck drew upon many dierent
areas of psychology and psychiatry, as well as Eastern philosophies, while developing their techniques. Their
psychoanalytic training exposed them to the directive approach of Adler and to Horney's emphasis on the
(which can be viewed as a neurotic belief or a type of automatic thought). In addition, they cited theorists,
authors, and spiritual leaders such as Bandura, Frankl, Rogers, Piaget, the Dalai Lama, D. T. Suzuki, Lao
Tsu, Jesus of Nazareth, and many others. The range of ideas that Ellis and Beck synthesized into a cohesive
and direct approach to psychotherapy is unparalleled in the elds of psychology and psychiatry.

Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy
In order to understand Ellis' perspective on therapy, one must rst understand his perspective on the basis
of psychological disturbances, whether they are minor problems with personal adjustment or more serious
forms of mental illness. Individuals with problems typically have a long history related to the disorder. Using
the same example as Ellis (1957), suppose a woman is chronically depressed because she has been rejected
by men she really liked and with whom she wanted to have long-term relationships. She understandably
concludes that the activating event of being rejected leads to the consequence of being depressed. However,
this conclusion is wrong! According to Ellis, it is not the rejection that causes her depression, it is the belief
system that arises within her, particularly irrational beliefs, that cause her depression. For example, if she
rationally believed that it was unfortunate that someone she liked rejected her, or that it was frustrating
that she was rejected, she might not become depressed. However, if she irrationally believes that it is
that she has been rejected, or that she

should

awful

have been more beautiful so that he wouldn't have rejected

her, then she is quite likely to become depressed. This is what Ellis referred to as the A-B-C's of emotional
disturbance or self-defeating behaviors and attitudes. A refers to the

activating event (being rejected), B

refers to the person's beliefs(this is awful, I'm not pretty), and C is the consequence of the beliefs: depression.
The basis for therapy in such situations can be found by extending the A-B-C's to the D-E's: disputing (D)
the irrational beliefs, which hopefully leads to the cognitive eect (E - eective new philosophies, emotions,
and behaviors) of disrupting the self-defeating patterns of behavior (Ellis, 1957, 1973, 1996). More recently,
Ellis has proposed one more letter for his

ABC theory of personality, the letter G for goals (*note:

there is no F). Goals consist of a person's purposes, values, standards, and hopes. When these goals are
thwarted by an activating event, the person can respond by choosing healthy or unhealthy alternatives, and
the nature of that choice is based on one's beliefs (Ellis, 1994). Ellis considered the ABC theory to be so
straightforward that it could prove helpful to anyone.
When an individual has become trapped by unhealthy belief systems and the corresponding self-defeating
behavior patterns that accompany them, the potential need for psychotherapy arises. The therapy that Ellis
developed has come to be known as

rational emotive behavior therapy, or REBT (the name went

through several permutations over Ellis' career, and he nally settled on REBT). The primary task of the
therapist using REBT is to challenge the client's irrational beliefs and, in so doing, to help the client change
their belief systems. In essence, when the client believes that it would be catastrophic for a certain negative
outcome to occur, the therapist tries to help them by disputing the irrational belief with questions such as:
Why would a certain outcome be catastrophic? While trying to dispute the irrational beliefs, the therapist
also searches for underlying philosophies that support the irrational belief system, philosophies that can
then also be disputed.

In addition to the cognitive aspect of REBT, the therapist often encourages the

client to act against their irrational fears. If the client is willing, they have the opportunity to experience
anxiety-ridden situations without the catastrophic consequences they have feared (although the help of the
therapist may prove necessary along the way). Throughout this process, REBT does not intend to ignore
the person's feelings. However, when a client is suering from unhealthy and self-defeating feelings, such
as anxiety, depression, or anger, REBT can help to minimize those unhealthy feelings. In addition, REBT
encourages healthy, positive emotions, and recognizes that sometimes a strong negative response, such as

sadness or grief, to a tragic activating event may be healthy or constructive.

When utilized eectively,

REBT oered what Ellis believed was a better, deeper, and more enduring therapy, which could achieve
those results in a fairly brief amount of time (Ellis, 1962, 1973, 1994, 1995, 1996). Ellis also believed that
REBT was applicable to a wider range of clients than any other psychotherapy:
RET [later known as REBT], on the contrary, seems to be almost the only major kind of psychotherapy
(aside, perhaps, from Zen Buddhism, if this is conceptualized as psychotherapy. . .) that holds that the
individual does not need

any

trait, characteristic, achievement, purpose, or social approval in order to

accept himself. In fact, he does not have to rate himself, esteem himself, or have any self-measurement or
self-concept whatever. (pg. 65; Ellis, 1973)
First and foremost, Ellis focused on practical applications of psychotherapy, and he considered his approach to be humanistic in its emphasis on the whole person. He acknowledged that REBT shared important
elements with the approaches of other classic theorists who had emphasized the value of individuals, including Alfred Adler, Viktor Frankl, Rollo May, Carl Rogers, Abraham Maslow, and Karen Horney (Ellis, 1973,
1995). Ellis' discussion of the practice of REBT seems to focus on what Horney addressed in her concepts of
neurotic needs and the tyranny of the should. Taken together, the desire to focus on practical applications
and helping individuals has led to a wide variety of self-help books based on REBT (Yankura & Dryden,

How to Live With
a Neurotic (Ellis, 1957), A New Guide to Rational Living (Ellis & Harper, 1975), How to Live With - and
Without - Anger (Ellis, 1977), How to Cope With a Fatal Illness (Ellis & Abrams, 1994), How to Keep
People from Pushing Your Buttons (Ellis & Lange, 1994), How to Control Your Anxiety Before It Controls
You (Ellis, 1998), and Sex Without Guilt in the 21st Century (Ellis, 2003). REBT has also been applied to
1994). Naturally, this list includes many books by Ellis himself, including titles such as

a wide variety of other problems that have been covered in Ellis' books, such as marriage counseling, personality disorders, depression, and even schizophrenia, and REBT has proved successful in both individual
and group settings (Ellis, 1962, 1973, 2001; Ellis & Dryden, 1987).

Discussion Question: Rational emotive behavior therapy is based on the ABC theory of personality.
Can you think of situations in which activating events led you to specic consequences, even though your
beliefs, if you thought about them enough, were the real reason for the consequence you experienced?
Ellis, as well as other therapists using REBT, has also addressed addictive disorders, including alcoholism
(Ellis, 2001; Ellis, McInerney, DiGuiseppe, & Yeager, 1988; Trimpey, Velten, & Dain, 1993; Yeager, Yeager,
& Shillingford, 1993). In the early 1990s,

Rational Recovery (RR) was developed by Jack Trimpey as an

alternative to the Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) approach to treating alcohol abuse. Both Ellis and Trimpey
challenge the basic principles of AA: that the addict has no control over their alcohol cravings, that they
must turn over control to a higher power (such as God), that they can never drink alcohol again, and that
only AA works for alcoholics. Objective research simply does not support these assertions, and practitioners
of REBT and RR have great faith in the ability of individuals to take control of their own lives (though they
may need some help from a therapist to get on the right path). RR also does not include the strong religious
overtones of AA, which may be an impediment to recovery for anyone required to attend AA meetings but
who does not believe in God:

. . .The

core of these methods is learning to recognize and dispute self-defeating thinking that RR fre-

quently labels the Beast or the addictive voice. In addition to its treatment purposes, RR has a political
purpose in advocating for people who are mandated to attend spiritual healing groups but who nd that
approach useless or oensive. Furthermore, RR attempts to educate professionals about available options
and sensitize them to the ethical and possible legal issues involved in overriding client's objections to spiritual
healing approaches. (pg. 271; Trimpey, Velten, & Dain, 1993)
Since REBT focuses on the choices that individuals make for themselves, what role is there for religion
within such a perspective?

Ellis maintains that there is a signicant positive correlation between devout

religious beliefs and a variety of emotional disturbances. However, he has argued that the problem is not
religion

per se, but rather highly restrictive, dogmatic religiosity that causes problems for an individual (Ellis,
Tao Te Ching ),

2004; also see Yankura & Dryden, 1994). Ellis studied the works of Lao Tsu (author of the

Gotama Buddha (known by most people simply as the Buddha), and the existential theologian Paul Tillich,
nding helpful perspectives for working with his clients and on his own problems (Ellis, 2004). He overcame

431

his early objections to religion and spirituality by recognizing that when one's religious beliefs contribute to
good psychological health the belief itself, regardless of whether or not God exists, is helpful. Similarly, Zen
Buddhism is not actually a religion, but has signicant religious overtones. Nonetheless, Ellis was impressed
by the eectiveness of Zen meditation for many clients, so he incorporated various Eastern perspectives into
the development of REBT.

Discussion Question: Alcoholics Anonymous has helped many people, but it doesn't help everyone,
especially those who are opposed to religiosity or are simply atheists. Nonetheless, the AA approach has
become a standard recommendation in many legal jurisdictions when someone commits a crime such as
drunk driving. What do you think about Rational Recovery (based on REBT) as an alternative to AA?

Is Self-Esteem a Sickness?
The heading for this section is the title of the rst chapter in a fascinating book by Ellis:

Self-Esteem

The Myth of

(Ellis, 2005). Ellis believed that self-esteem is dened by psychologists in a way that requires

individuals to rate, or judge, themselves. This may work ne when everything is going well for the person,
but people are not perfect. Thus, they will eventually fail at something, perhaps at many things, and they
must then judge themselves as bad, or unworthy. If, however, you accept yourself as imperfect, and rate
only your behaviors and thoughts, not your self, then you need not suer from the eects of low self-esteem.
In other words, Ellis advocates unconditional self-acceptance, a very old philosophy known to the Greeks,
Romans, Buddhists, Daoists, and others (Ellis, 2005).

Ellis considers many dierent approaches to the

concepts of self-esteem and self-acceptance, including the perspectives of Solomon, Jesus of Nazareth, the
existential philosophers Kierkegaard, Heidegger, and Sartre, Carl Rogers, the Eastern philosophers Lao Tsu,
D. T. Suzuki, and the Dalai Lama, and Steven Hayes (founder of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy,
see below).

Ellis concludes that one must seek not only to unconditionally accept oneself, but also to

unconditionally accept others and the nature of life itself. But this is not a pie-in-the-sky philosophy. Ellis
recognizes that there are sad and unfortunate events in life (we are fallible, and we are mortal). He strongly
recommends that we do not avoid normal sadness and regret, since these emotions provide the motivation
for trying to prevent unfortunate events and for seeking new relationships. The choice is yours:
Both self-esteem and self-acceptance, then, can be had denitionally - for the asking, for the choosing.
Take one or the other. Choose! Better yet, take no

global

rating. Choose your goals and values and rate

how you experience them - well or badly. Don't rate yourself, being, entity, personality at all. Your totality
is too complex and too changing to measure. Repeatedly acknowledge
Now stop farting around and get on with your

life !

that.

(pg. 16; Ellis, 2005)

Discussion Question: Ellis opposes the concept of self-esteem because he believes it requires a person
to judge themselves. He advocates instead that we unconditionally accept ourselves, faults included. Does
this make sense to you?

Beck's Cognitive Model of Depression
Having begun his research in an attempt to examine Freud's theory on the cause of depression, Beck
continued studying depression and suicide throughout his career. The reason for this continued focus was
the prevalence of depression in society:
Depression is the most common psychiatric disorder treated in oce practice and in outpatient clinics.
Some authorities have estimated that at least 12 per cent of the adult population will have an episode of
depression of sucient clinical severity to warrant treatment. (pg. vii; Beck, 1967)
Relying on an interplay between clinical work and research, Beck proposed a cognitive model based on

automatic thoughts, schemas, and cognitive distortions (Beck, 1967; Beck & Freeman, 1990; Beck,
Rush, Shaw, & Emery, 1979; Beck & Weishaar, 1995; Pretzer & Beck, 2005).
an individual's immediate, spontaneous appraisals of a given situation.

Automatic thoughts are

They shape and elicit a person's

emotional and behavioral responses to that situation. Since they are automatic, they are rarely questioned.
Even when they are predominantly negative, the individual accepts them as true and can be overwhelmed
by constant questions and images that hurt one's self-esteem (questions such as Why am I such a failure,
or seeing oneself as ugly).

The reason that even highly negative automatic thoughts are accepted, even

when they might be objectively untrue, is that these thoughts do not arise spontaneously.

Rather, they

are the result of the person's schemas. Every situation is comprised of many stimuli, and when confronted

432

with an unfamiliar situation a person tends to conceptualize it. Although dierent people will conceptualize
the situation dierently, each individual will be consistent. These stable cognitive patterns of interpreting
situations are known as schemas. An individual's schemas then determine how they are likely to respond,
automatically, to many situations.
People are also prone to a variety of cognitive distortions, which can amplify the eects of one's schemas,
thus helping to conrm maladaptive schemas even when contradictory evidence is available. Over time, Beck

dichotomous thinking, or
personalization, the tendency
to interpret external events as being related directly to oneself; overgeneralization, the application of
isolated incidents to either all or at least many other situations; and catastrophizing, treating actual or

and his colleagues have identied a growing number of such distortions, such as:
seeing things as only black or white, without the possibility of shades of gray;

anticipated negative events as intolerable catastrophes, even though they may be relatively minor problems.
Overall, these cognitive distortions lead the individual into extreme, judgmental, global interpretations of the
situations they experience, which establish general schemas, which lead to automatic thoughts and feelings
that support the idiosyncratic experience of the world (Beck, Rush, Shaw, & Emery, 1979; Beck & Weishaar,
1995; Pretzer & Beck, 2005). The goal of cognitive therapy, therefore, is to help the individual break out of
this self-supporting, maladaptive pattern of cognition.
Another important aspect of the depressive syndrome is known as the

cognitive triad, three cognitive

patterns that cause the person to view themselves in a negative manner. First, the individual has a negative
view of themselves. Primarily, the depressed individual sees themselves as defective in some psychological,
moral, or physical way, and because of the presumed defects they are undesirable and worthless. Second,
the depressed person has a tendency to interpret their ongoing experiences in negative ways. These negative
misinterpretations persist even in the face of incompatible evidence. And nally, they tend to hold a negative
view of the future. They anticipate continued diculty, failure, emotional suering. As a result, they lack
motivation, they become paralyzed by pessimism and hopelessness.

According to Beck, suicide can be

viewed as an extreme attempt to escape problems that depressed individuals believe cannot be solved and
the unbearable suering that the future holds! These negative cognitive patterns are not something that
the depressed person plans or has much control over, since they typically occur in the form of automatic
thoughts (Beck, 1967; Beck, Rush, Shaw, & Emery, 1979; Beck & Weishaar, 1995; also see Beck, Resnick, &
Lettieri, 1974).

Discussion Question: Beck described a number of common cognitive distortions, including dichotomous
thinking, personalization, overgeneralization, and catastrophizing. Think about situations in your own life
when you made these distortions. What sort of problems resulted from these cognitive errors, and how often
do you make them?

Beck's Cognitive Therapy
Cognitive therapy, according to Beck, is an active, directive, time-limited, structured approach used to
treat a variety of psychiatric disorders (Beck, Rush, Shaw, & Emery, 1979).

With regard to depression,

it is most eective after a major depression has lifted somewhat, though it can also be helpful for some
patients during depression, particularly if the depression is of the reactive type (as opposed to endogenous
depression; Beck, 1967). As mentioned above, the basic procedure is to help the individual break out of the
trap of negative schemas, automatic thoughts, and cognitive distortions that support the client's problem.
The techniques employed are designed to identify, test the reality of, and correct the cognitive distortions
and schemas that lead to dysfunctional automatic thoughts. It involves an active collaboration between the
therapist and the client, such that the client learns to reduce their symptoms by thinking and acting more
realistically.
Beck referred to the constant interaction between the client and the therapist as collaborative empiricism, and contrasted this approach to both psychoanalysis and client-centered therapy. His intention
was to provide the client with a series of specic learning experiences that would teach the patient the
following skills:

(1) monitoring their own negative, automatic thoughts; (2) recognizing the connections

between thought, emotion, and behavior; (3) examining evidence for and against their cognitive distortions;
(4) substituting reality-based interpretations for their cognitive distortions; and (5) learning to identify and
alter the dysfunctional schemas that lead to the cognitive distortions (Beck, Rush, Shaw, & Emery, 1979).

433

The interaction with the client is not supercial, as it involves discussing the very rationale of the therapy
to the patient and, ultimately, providing the client with techniques to monitor their dysfunctional thoughts
on their own. The therapist teaches the client to recognize the nature of cognition, particularly the client's
dysfunctional cognitions, all with the goal of eventually neutralizing the automatic thoughts.
related to collaborative empiricism is the concept of

Somewhat

guided discovery. Guided discovery is the process

by which the therapist serves as a guide for the client, in order to help them recognize their problematic
cognitions and behaviors and also help them design new experiences (behavioral experiments) in which they
might acquire new skills and perspectives (Beck & Weishaar, 1995). In addition, the therapeutic relationship
provides an opportunity for the client to begin to make progress:
If the patient begins to feel better after the expression of feeling, this may then set up a favorable cycle.
Since the depressed patient may have lost hope that he would ever be able to feel better again, this positive
experience helps to restore his morale and also his motivation to cooperate in the therapy. Any evidence
of feeling better is likely to increase the patient's motivation for therapy and thus contribute to its ecacy.
(pp. 43-44; Beck, Rush, Shaw, & Emery, 1979)
Although Beck focused much of his research on depression, cognitive therapy can be used to treat a wide
variety of psychiatric and psychological disorders, including anxiety disorders, phobias, substance abuse
disorders, anger and violence, and personality disorders (Beck, 1999; Beck & Emery, 1985; Beck & Freeman,
1990; Beck & Weishaar, 1995; Beck, Wright, Newman, & Liese, 1993; Pretzer & Beck, 2005). In

Never Enough

(Beck, 1988), Beck extended cognitive therapy to working with couples.

Love is

He had observed

that many of his depressed client's were in troubled relationships, and in other cases his client's depression
and/or anxiety had led to relationship problems. As Beck began working with couples, he found that couples
were capable of the same cognitive distortions that individuals make, as each party within the relationship
began focusing on the negative aspects of the relationship. As conict grows, the partners blame each other,
rather than seeing the conict as a problem that can be resolved. Just as with individuals, cognitive therapy
oers a means for breaking the cycle of conict and miscommunication.

Discussion Question: Collaborative empiricism and guided discovery both suggest that the client must
be an active member of the therapeutic team. In your opinion, is it possible for someone who needs therapy
to help in their own recovery? Do you think there is a point at which the therapist must take over in order
to ensure that therapy is successful?

Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) and Radical Acceptance
A recent development in cognitive therapy shares an ancient tradition with Eastern philosophies: mindfulness.

Mindfulness training involves learning to accept one's emotional realities, and one of the most

signicant realities is that much of human life involves suering.
Steven Hayes and his colleagues have developed

Starting with these basic observations,

Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT; Hayes

& Smith, 2005; Hayes, Strosahl, & Wilson, 1999; see also Eifert & Forsyth, 2005; Hayes, Follette, & Linehan,
2004). Hayes and his colleagues do not mean acceptance in the sense of resigning oneself to suering, but
rather in the sense of accepting life as it comes.

Then, one must commit oneself to moving forward and

living a values-based life, regardless of the presence of challenges:
The constant possibility of psychological pain is a challenging burden that we all need to face. . .This
doesn't mean that you must resign yourself to trudging through your life suering. Pain and suering are
very dierent. We believe that there is a way to change your relationship to pain and to then live a good life,
perhaps a great life, even though you are a human being whose memory and verbal skills keep the possibility
of pain just an instant away. (pg. 12; Hayes & Smith, 2005)
Although Hayes and his colleagues make passing reference to mindfulness as a Buddhist teaching, they do
not take a spiritual approach with ACT. They do, however, acknowledge that psychologists often make the
mistake of ignoring spiritual practices that might prove helpful to their clients (Hayes, Strosahl, & Wilson,
1999).

Many people in psychology today, including Ellis and Beck, recognize that cognitive psychology

began with the Buddha some 2,500 years ago (Ellis, 2005; Pretzer & Beck, 2005; see also Olendzki, 2005).
Dr. Tara Brach, a clinical psychologist and teacher of mindfulness meditation (also known as

vipassana,

which means to see clearly), makes no qualms about following a Buddhist approach to therapy. In

Acceptance: Embracing Your Life with the Heart of a Buddha

a trance of unworthiness. Plagued by beliefs of their own inadequacies, some individuals limit their ability
to live a full life. Consequently, they cannot trust that they are lovable, and they live with an undercurrent
of depression or helplessness.

They then embark on a series of strategies designed to protect themselves:

they attempt self-improvement projects, they hold back and play it safe, they withdraw from the present
moment, they keep busy, they criticize themselves, and they focus on other's faults.

Radical Acceptance

as a therapeutic approach involves both mindfulness meditation and Buddhist teachings on compassion as
a basis for teaching people to accept themselves as they are:
Radical Acceptance reverses our habit of living at war with experiences that are unfamiliar, frightening or
intense. It is the necessary antidote to years of neglecting ourselves, years of judging and treating ourselves
harshly, years of rejecting this moment's experience.

Radical Acceptance is the willingness to experience

ourselves and our life as it is. A moment of Radical Acceptance is a moment of genuine freedom. (pg. 4;
Brach, 2003)
Mindfulness as a therapeutic technique has also been used by a variety of other therapists: in couples
therapy (Christensen, Sevier, Simpson, & Gattis, 2004; Fruzzetti & Iverson, 2004), following traumatic
experiences (Follette, Palm, & Rasmussen Hall, 2004), and for the treatment of eating disorders (Wilson,
2004) and substance abuse (Marlatt, et al., 2004). Janet Surrey, one of the founding members of the Stone
Center Group, has favorably compared relational psychotherapy to mindfulness (Surrey, 2005), and Trudy
Goodman, who studied child development with Jean Piaget, uses mindfulness in therapy with children
(Goodman, 2005). Thus, whether in the more structured approach of ACT or Radical Acceptance, or in
more informal ways in the hands of therapists familiar with mindfulness meditation, paying attention to the
mind in a calm and careful way is becoming an important trend in psychotherapy.

According to Steven

Hayes (2004), this approach represents a third wave in behavioral-cognitive therapy, following traditional
behavior therapy and then the cognitive therapies of Ellis and Beck. This third wave is also the basis for
the popular and inuential work of Jon Kabat-Zinn (1990, 1994, 2005; see also Germer et al., 2005) and
connects behavioral and cognitive theories to the rapidly growing eld of

social neuroscience (the study of

the interactive inuences between the structure/function of the brain and social behavior; see, e.g., Begley,
2007; Cacioppo et al., 2006; Cozolino, 2002; Harmon-Jones & Winkielman, 2007; Siegel, 1999, 2007).

Personality Theory in Real Life: Beck's Cognitive Therapy
and the Treatment of Personality Disorders
Aaron Beck and a number of his colleagues, as well as others, have attempted to apply cognitive therapy
to the treatment of personality disorders. It is widely accepted that personality disorders are highly resistant
to treatment, but aside from the problems they present by themselves, there is another important reason to
continue trying to address these serious psychological disorders. Personality disorders often co-occur with
other psychological conditions (Axis I disorders), and they may be the primary reason why psychotherapy
does not work well with certain patients (Pretzer & Beck, 2005).

Since cognitive therapy in particular

requires that the therapist gain an understanding of what the client is thinking, in order to then help the
client recognize their own dysfunctional cognitions so that the client may work toward change, it is necessary
for the therapist to have a complete understanding of the client's psychological make-up.

As a prelude

to treating personality disorders with cognitive therapy, one needs to understand personality disorders in
cognitive-behavioral terms.
As with depression, or any other psychological disorder, the cognitive-behavioral perspective suggests
that individuals suering from personality disorders have formed dysfunctional schemas that create an attributional bias, which then causes the person to interpret life's experiences in dysfunctional ways, but in ways
that nonetheless support and maintain the dysfunction of the personality disorder. If this theory is accurate,
one should be able to identify typical patterns of dysfunctional schemas that match the characterization of
dierent personality disorder diagnoses.

Indeed, Beck and Freeman (1990) have oered those patterns in

Cognitive Therapy of Personality Disorders.

What distinguishes the negative schemas that characterize per-

sonality disorders from schemas that characterize other psychological disorders reects the basic dierence
between Axis II and Axis I in the DSM system:
The typical schemas of the personality disorders resemble those that are activated in the symptom
syndromes, but they are operative on a more continuous basis in information processing.

In dependent

435

personality disorder, the schema I need help will be activated whenever a problematic situation arises,
whereas in depressed persons it will be prominent only during the depression. In personality disorders, the
schemas are part of normal, everyday processing of information. (pg. 32; Beck & Freeman, 1990)
What might the typical schemas associated with other personality disorders be? Beck and his colleagues
oer detailed examples for all ten of the personality disorders listed in the DSM, as well as for the passiveaggressive (negativistic) personality disorder (Beck & Freeman, 1990; Pretzer & Beck, 2005). To cite just a
few examples, the antisocial individual thinks that people are there to be taken, the narcissistic individual
thinks I am special, and the histrionic individual believes I need to impress. As a result of these basic beliefs and attitudes, these individuals adopt corresponding behavioral strategies. The dependent person seeks
attachment, the antisocial person attacks, the narcissist engages in self-aggrandizement, and the histrionic
person performs dramatically (Beck & Freeman, 1990).
How does a personality disorder arise, according to the cognitive-behavioral perspective? First, there are
inherited predispositions that may represent primeval strategies. For example, Beck has suggested that the
antisocial personality reects a predatory strategy, whereas in contrast, the paranoid personality reects a
defensive strategy (see Pretzer & Beck, 2005). Second, the characteristics of personality disorders can result
from social learning, especially when the social environment enhances genetic predispositions. A child born
with a shy disposition, in a household that seems threatening and/or confusing, may naturally withdraw.
That withdrawal, taken to its extreme, is a strategy compatible with the avoidant personality disorder.
And nally, there is the possibility of traumatic experiences during development.

If one's experiences during this important time are dysfunctional and

traumatic, the individual is likely to develop a personality that has ingrained dysfunctional schemas, thus
aecting the individual's life from that point forward. In this model, personality disorders are not necessarily

with others, they become signicant, problematic features of one's daily life:

the attention of mental health professionals. (pg. 61; Pretzer & Beck, 2005)
The basic approach to treating personality disorders with cognitive therapy is not dierent than usual,
but does require some special attention to detail:
Personality disorders are among the most dicult and least understood problems faced by therapists
regardless of the therapist's orientation. The treatment of clients with these disorders can be just as complex
and frustrating for cognitive therapists as it is for other therapists. . .For cognitive therapy to live up to its
promise as an approach to understanding and treating personality disorders, it is necessary to tailor the
approach to the characteristics of individuals with personality disorders rather than simply using standard
cognitive therapy without modication. (pp. 44-45; Pretzer & Beck, 2005)
Based on this concern, Pretzer and Beck (2005) have oered a list of twelve key elements that require
attention when using cognitive therapy to treat an individual with a personality disorder:
1.

Interventions are most eective when based on an individualized conceptualization of the client's

problems.
2. It is important for therapist and client to work collaboratively toward clearly identied, shared goals.
3. It is important to focus more than the usual amount of attention on the therapist-client relationship.
4. Consider beginning with interventions which do not require extensive self-disclosure.
5. Interventions that increase the client's sense of self-ecacy often reduce the intensity of the client's
symptomatology and facilitate other interventions.
6. Do not rely primarily on verbal interventions.
7. Try to identify and address the client's fears before implementing changes.
8. Help the client deal adaptively with aversive emotions.
9. Anticipate problems with compliance.
10. Do not presume that the client exists in a reasonable environment.
11. Attend to your own emotional reactions during the course of therapy.

Be realistic regarding the length of therapy, goals for therapy, and standards for therapist self-

evaluation.
Despite these straight-forward steps toward eective cognitive therapy, it seems clear from looking at them
that there are going to be challenges when dealing with clients who have a personality disorder. Indeed, the
very process of collaborative empiricism can be quite dicult with these clients. Beck & Freeman (1990)
have identied nineteen problems associated with establishing an eective collaboration with clients who
have a personality disorder:
1. The patient may lack the skill to be collaborative.
2. The therapist may lack the skill to develop collaboration.
3. Environmental stressors may preclude changing or reinforce dysfunctional behavior.
4. Patients' ideas and beliefs regarding their potential failure in therapy may contribute to noncollaboration.
5. Patients' ideas and beliefs regarding eects of the patients' changing on others may preclude compliance.
6. Patients' fears regarding changing and the new self may contribute to noncompliance.
7. The patient's and therapist's dysfunctional beliefs may be harmoniously blended.
8. Poor socialization to the model may be a factor in noncompliance.
9. A patient may experience secondary gain from maintaining the dysfunctional pattern.
10. Poor timing of interventions may be a factor in noncompliance.
11. Patients may lack motivation.
12. Patients' rigidity may foil compliance.
13. The patient may have poor impulse control.
14. The goals of therapy may be unrealistic.
15. The goals of therapy may be unstated.
16. The goals of therapy may be vague and amorphous.
17. There may have been no agreement between therapist and patient relative to the treatment goals.
18. The patient or therapist may be frustrated because of a lack of progress in therapy.
19. Issues involving the patient's perception of lowered status and self-esteem may be factors in noncompliance.
Although Beck and his colleagues oer more details and specic clinical examples in their writings (Beck &
Freeman, 1990; Pretzer & Beck, 2005), the preceding lengthy list of problems a therapist is like to encounter
clearly suggests that working with these clients is dicult at best.

So, is cognitive therapy eective in

the treatment of personality disorders? Numerous uncontrolled clinical reports suggest that it is, but the
small number of controlled studies have oered equivocal results. More important, however, is the reality of
real-life clinical practice:
In clinical practice, most therapists do not apply a standardized treatment protocol with a homogenous
sample of individuals who share a common diagnosis. Instead, clinicians face a variety of clients and take
an individualized approach to treatment. A recent study of the eectiveness of cognitive therapy under such
real world conditions provides important support for the clinical use of cognitive therapy with clients who
are diagnosed as having personality disorders. . . (pg. 102; Pretzer & Beck, 2005)
So what can we conclude from this discussion? There is consensus that personality disorders are prevalent
in our society and they are resistant to treatment.
oered a promising avenue for further research.

Cognitive therapy, and the theory underlying it, has

Given the signicant impact of personality disorders on

both individuals and society as a whole, any promising line of research deserves to be pursued vigorously.

19.1 Review of Key Points
•

Personal construct theory emphasizes the cognitions that precede behavior, even more than one's ability
to accurately predict behavior.

•

Kelly used the term man-the-scientist to describe how each person creates and tests representations of
the world, in an eort to predict and control their environment.

•

Our representations, or constructs, are open to revision, and there are always alternatives. The process
by which we test and modify our constructs is called constructive alternativism.

•

Personal construct theory begins with a fundamental postulate, which is then elaborated with eleven
corollaries.

•

Personal constructs regularly undergo transition, from ineective constructs to more eective constructs. Problems with these transitions may result in feelings of threat, fear, guilt, or anxiety.

•

There are two typical cycles of transition:

the C-P-C Cycle and the Creativity Cycle.

The rst

involves circumspection, preemption, and control. The Creativity Cycle requires beginning with loose
constructions and then rapidly testing and pursuing new and eective constructs.

•
•

Creativity appears to be an important component of healthy psychological functioning.
Both the therapist and the client bring their own conceptualizations about therapy into the therapeutic
process. The ultimate goal is to help the client generate movement forward, such that the process can
continue after therapy has ended.

•

In order to facilitate cognitive-behavioral therapy within his theoretical framework, Kelly developed
an assessment tool known as the Role Construct Repertory Test and a therapeutic procedure known
as xed-role therapy.

•

In diverse settings, it is essential for therapists to be familiar with cross-cultural issues related to
therapy in order to understand the nature of a client's constructs and schemas.

•

Ellis proposed an ABC theory of personality: activating events lead to beliefs about a situation, and
those beliefs lead to the consequences of the event.

•

Rational emotive behavior therapy was designed to dispute the client's irrational beliefs, thus leading
to eective new philosophies, emotions, and behaviors.

•

The straightforward nature of rational emotive behavior therapy, and Ellis' willingness to write for a
popular audience, was a major factor in establishing the self-help genera.

•

Rational Recovery, based on rational emotive behavior therapy, was developed as an alternative to
Alcoholics Anonymous. In particular, it does not include the religious requirements of AA.

•

Rational emotive behavior therapy was challenged as being atheistic. Ellis later wrote that he is not
opposed to spirituality, but he is opposed to dysfunctional, dogmatic religious beliefs that hinder one's
personal growth.

•

Ellis openly challenged the value placed on self-esteem, suggesting instead that what is important is
acceptance of ourselves, including our aws and mistakes.

•
•

Beck developed his cognitive therapy while conducting research on depression.
Beck's cognitive model is based on automatic thoughts, schemas, and cognitive distortions. Depression
in particular results from a cognitive triad: a negative view of past, present, and future.

•
•

Cognitive therapy oers an active, directive, time-limited, and structured approach to psychotherapy.
Cognitive therapy involves collaborative empiricism and guided discovery. Hopefully, the client is able
to learn skills that will allow them to continue improving their life even after therapy has ended.

•

Acceptance and Commitment Therapy incorporates mindfulness into a modern therapeutic process,
emphasizing the acceptance of one's suering in life followed by moving forward and living a valuesbased life. Radical Acceptance incorporates traditional Buddhist mindfulness practice (vipassana) into
the therapeutic process.

Personality Disorders

Many students begin a personality course hoping to learn about personality disorders. As fascinating and
disturbing as personality disorders can be, this topic is best covered in an abnormal psychology course.
However, many instructors also like to discuss personality disorders, in part to address the importance of
developing a healthy personality. Thus, this appendix has been included to briey present this topic, for those
students and instructors who want to include it within their overall examination of personality development.

A Complex Problem
When I rst wrote this appendix I approached the complexity of personality disorders by including two
sections: the DSM criteria for diagnosing personality disorders and an alternative way of categorizing these
disorders proposed by Theodore Millon. With the advent of the DSM-V (American Psychiatric Association,
2013) things have gotten even more complex.

The DSM-V continues with the same categories as were

used in the DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association, 2000), but then it oers a completely dierent set of
criteria for diagnosing personality disorders. No other DSM edition has done this, suggesting that personality
disorders are proving to be the most complex group of psychological disorders.
So, I have now kept the same two rst sections, since the ocial diagnostic criteria are essentially the
same (only some changes in the wording of the text) and Theodore Millon's alternative theory is particularly
interesting. Then, I briey describe the new alterntive being oered in the DSM-V (leaving it up to you to
explore them in more detail).

DSM-V Categories of Personality Disorder
The

Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Ed.

(DSM-V; American Psychiatric

Association, 2013) denes personality disorders as an enduring pattern of inner experience and behavior that
deviates markedly from the expectations of the individual's culture, is pervasive and inexible, has an onset
in adolescence or early adulthood, is stable over time, and leads to distress or impairment. The consideration
of cultural context is perhaps the most signicant change in this denition from the earlier DSM-III. The
DSM-V suggests that the personality disorders can be grouped into three clusters, plus a not otherwise
specied category, for a total of 11 specic diagnoses, the authors caution that the identied clusters have
not been consistently validated and that individuals may present combinations of personality disorders from
dierent clusters.

Nonetheless, the DSM-V still presents the three clusters of personality disorders (plus

Cluster A, the odd or eccentric types, are paranoid,
Cluster B, the dramatic, emotional, or erratic types,
are antisocial, borderline, histrionic, and narcissistic personality disorders. And nally, Cluster C, the
anxious or fearful types, are the avoidant, dependent, and obsessive-compulsive personality disorders.

the not otherwise specied classication).

schizoid, and schizotypal personality disorders.

The odd or eccentric personality disorders represent several of the typical symptoms of schizophrenia
(paranoia, emotional detachment, and social withdrawal), leading some to suggest that they represent mild
forms of the most widely recognized form of psychosis.

However, distinct dierences suggest that these

personality disorders are not part of a continuum between normal personality and schizophrenia. For ex-

ample, in individuals with an odd or eccentric personality disorder who also exhibit psychotic symptoms,
the personality disorder can be recognized prior to the onset of psychotic symptoms and persists when the
psychotic symptoms are in remission. Also, these disorders are not characterized by a pronounced thought
disorder, which appears to be the dening characteristic of schizophrenia.
The dramatic, emotional, or erratic personality disorders include the most well-known, due in no small
part to their dramatization in movies and television. Most serial killers suer from antisocial personality
disorder (they are often referred to as psychopaths), as do many people in prison. People with antisocial
personality disorder demonstrate a complete lack of regard for the rights of others, and will routinely violate
those rights. The other personality disorders in this cluster involve various forms of unstable interpersonal
relationships, excessive emotions, and a distorted self-image. Interestingly, this cluster appears to involve a
signicant gender factor, in that antisocial personality disorder is diagnosed more frequently in men, whereas
the borderline and histrionic personality disorders are diagnosed more frequently in women.
Probably the least recognized group of personality disorders, among students and the general public are
the anxious or fearful personality disorders. The rst two, avoidant personality disorder and dependent personality disorder, both involve pervasive patterns of anxiety relating to interpersonal relationships. Finally,
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder involves a pervasive preoccupation with neatness, perfectionism,
and interpersonal control.
Although the DSM-IV-TR made a point of adding cultural context to the denition of personality disorders, it wasn't until the publication of the DSM-V that much was said in the manual about culture. Not
only is there limited research regarding the inuence of culture on personality disorders, there is likewise
only limited research on cultural inuences on normal personality. The notable exception to this may be
the well-known research on fundamental dierences between individualistic vs. collectivist cultures, which
are generally associated with Western vs. Eastern approaches to life. There are also fundamental religious
associations that match these basic distinctions, since Western cultures are typically associated with the
Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam), whereas Eastern cultures are typically associated
with Yoga, Buddhism, Taoism, etc.

Discussion Question: What sort of impression do you have of people with personality disorders (it's
OK to consider things you have seen on television and in movies)?

Is this what you think of when you

typically think of mental illness or psychological disorders?

An Alternative Perspective on Categorizing Personality Disorders
Theodore Millon has presented a dierent perspective on the categorization of personality disorders based
upon an

evolutionary model of personality development. In this model, personality is seen within the same

context as any other factor contributing to the evolutionary survival of a species (and, therefore, individuals

existence (a person
adaptation (if the species cannot adapt it will become extinct),
replication (individuals can survive over time by having ospring), and abstraction (the ability to plan
representing that species). As with other species, humans need to succeed in four areas:
must continue to live as an individual),

and make good choices). According to Millon, we can now describe four polarities on which the personality

pleasure-pain polarity (existence), the activepassive polarity (adaptation), the self-other polarity (replication), and the thinking-feeling polarity
develops to accommodate these evolutionary needs: the

(abstraction). Personality disorders can be viewed as adaptive forms of development under abnormal conditions, and they can be classied in accordance with these four dimensions (as opposed to the three clusters
proposed in the DSM system). Millon cautions, however, that the complexity of individual personality and
the developmental processes involved make it dicult to dene in any simple terms how the development of
anyone's individual personality might have occurred (Millon, 1996; Millon & Grossman, 2005).
The rst category in this schema describes the

pleasure-decient personalities, individuals who

lack the ability to experience the joys, rewards, and positive experiences of life. Individuals with schizoid
personality disorder appear to lack the intrinsic capacity to experience the pleasurable aspects of life. Those
with avoidant personality disorder show an excessive preoccupation with, and an oversensitivity to, life's
stresses. And nally, people with depressive personality disorders have a pervasive sense of hopelessness and
futility in their lives. So although these disorders arise for dierent reasons, they all arrive at a common
point at which individuals suering from these disorders do not nd pleasure in their lives.

441

The second category includes those disorders that are characterized as interpersonally-imbalanced
personalities, a condition in which disordered individuals are either overly disposed to orient themselves
toward fullling the needs of others or overly inclined to meet their own selsh needs. The rst two disorders
in this group, dependent and histrionic personality disorders, are characterized by their need for social
approval and aection, and by their willingness to live according to the desires of others. Individuals with
dependent personality disorder do so by taking a passive stance, whereas those with histrionic personality
disorder take an active stance. Those with narcissistic and antisocial personality disorders turn inward for
gratication. For narcissistic types, their self-esteem is based on an inated assumption of their own personal
worth and superiority, and they expect others to behave accordingly.

Antisocial types are fundamentally

distrusting of others, and use aggressive self-determination as a protective maneuver.
The third category describes

intrapsychically-conicted personalities, individuals whose internal

orientations move in opposite directions. Thus, these individuals remain at war with themselves. In both
the sadistic personality disorder and the masochistic personality disorder the pleasure-pain polarity is transposed, such that normally pleasurable stimuli are experienced as painful and vice versa. For the compulsive
personality disorder and the negativistic personality disorder it is the self-other polarity that is disordered.
Individuals with compulsive personality disorder are caught within a conict between obedience and deance, but they suppress the conict in order to appear well controlled and single-minded. In contrast, those
with negativistic personality disorder fail to resolve their conicts, resulting in indecisiveness, inconsistent
attitudes, oppositional behavior and emotions, and they become generally erratic and unpredictable.
The three categories of disordered personality described above are primarily stylistic. Style, in this context, refers to the functional manner in which individuals relate to their internal and external worlds. The
nal category denes

structurally-defective personalities, much more deeply embedded disorders that

aect the function of the mind itself. Thus, the disorders in this nal category are considered more severe
than those in the categories described above. Schizotypal personality disorder involves eccentric thoughts,
behaviors, and perceptions that mirror those found in schizophrenia. Individuals with borderline personality
disorder exhibit deep and variable moods, including extended periods of dejection and disillusionment, occasional periods of euphoria, and frequent episodes of irritability, self-destructive acts, and impulsive anger.
The paranoid personality disorder is characterized by suspicion and hostility, and the tendency to misread
others and respond with anger to perceived deception and betrayal. And nally, the decompensated personality disorder, likely the most profoundly deteriorated personality type, involves consistent and pervasive
impairment that is rarely broken by clear thoughts or normal behavior.

Individuals with decompensated

personality disorder typically require institutionalization, since they simply cannot function in society.
As you can see, the personality disorders described by Millon include the disorders listed in the DSM
classication scheme, though the categories he uses are dierent than the three clusters in the DSM system.
Millon also describes ve disorders not included in the DSM system. For the most thorough discussion of the
categories and disordered personality types described above, see Millon's

and Beyond, 2nd Ed.

(1996).

Disorders of Personality: DSM-IV

For a number of dierent perspectives on the development of personality

disorders, including cognitive, psychoanalytic, attachment, and neurobehavioral models (among others), see

Major Theories of Personality Disorder, 2nd Ed.,

edited by Lenzenweger and Clarkin (2005).

Discussion Question: Millon has suggested that people with personality disorders have adapted in
predictable ways to abusive/neglectful environments.

Do you know anyone who seems to have

serious

personality problems that appear to reect how they were raised or the environment in which they grew up?

Treating Personality Disorders
It is generally accepted that personality disorders are highly resistant to treatment. Personality is wellestablished in childhood, or at least by adolescence. Since many theorists consider it dicult to signicantly
change personality once it is established, even in a normal individual, by the time an adult is diagnosed
with a personality disorder it has become a deeply embedded aspect of their personality. Thus, individuals
suering from personality disorders, individuals who typically lack insight into their problems, are simply
unlikely to realize a need for change or to put any eort into making changes. And since change can only
come from the individual, it cannot be forced by the therapist, if the individual suering from a personality
disorder does not cooperate with or put any eort into therapy, there can be no possibility for change. The

CHAPTER 20. PERSONALITY DISORDERS

442

evolutionary perspective on personality disorders oers another possible reason why they would be resistant
to change. Personality disorders may be adaptations to abnormal, most likely abusive, conditions present
during personality development. Therefore, even though they are viewed as abnormal, they have served an
adaptive purpose for the individual suering from the disorder.
Nonetheless,

progress is being made.

There is evidence to support the ecacy of some thera-

peutic approaches in the treatment of personality disorders, including cognitive, behavioral, interpersonal/psychosocial, and psychoanalytic treatments (Benjamin, 2005; Fonagy, 2006; Kernberg & Caligor,
2005; Leichsenring, 2006; Pretzer & Beck, 2005).

Perhaps the most thoroughly studied and eective ap-

proach to the treatment of personality disorders is

dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), developed by

Marsha Linehan specically for the treatment of borderline personality disorder and its commonly associated element of suicidal behavior (Linehan, 1987, 1993; Robins et al., 2004). DBT emphasizes the complete
process of change, incorporating both the acceptance of the patient's real suering and the desire for change.
Since a natural conict arises between acceptance and the desire/need for change, a conict that can arouse
intense negative emotion, DBT involves teaching patients mindfulness skills necessary to allow experiences
without the need to either suppress or avoid them. These mindfulness skills were drawn primarily from Zen
principles, but are similar to and compatible with Western contemplative practices (Robins et al., 2004).

Discussion Question: Does it surprise you to learn that the most promising treatment for personality
disorders is based largely on the practice of Zen? What might this say about the importance of therapists
being versed in a variety of techniques and being well-educated in cross-cultural perspectives?

A New Alternative in the DSM-V
The purpose for adding a second approach to the diagnosis of personality disorders is twofold:

rst,

the APA Board of Trustees wanted to provide continuity in the diagnoses being oered by clinicians, but
second, they recognised that few individuals with a personality disorder clearly t into the criteria for just
one personality disorder.

Thus, an alternative method has been proposed that considers assessing both

"impairments in personality

functioning

and pathological personality

traits "

(pg. 761; APA, 2013).

After listing general criteria for personality disorder that are quite similar to the traditional general
criteria, the alternative approach addresses personality functioning in terms of two dimensions: self and
interpersonal. The healthy vs. unhealthy aspects of the self involve one's sense of identity and one's selfdirection, whereas the interpersonal component addresses empathy and intimacy.

The individual is then

trait domains. The trait domains and associated facets are as follows:

hostility, perseveration, depressivity, suspiciousness, restricted aectivity (lack of )
Detachment: withdrawal, intimacy avoidance, anhedonia, depressivity, restricted aectivity,

Antagonism: manipulativeness, deceitfulness, grandiosity, attention seeking, callousness, hostility
Disinhibition: irresponsibility, impulsivity, distractibility, risk taking, rigid perfectionism (lack of )
Psychoticism: unusual beliefs and experiences, eccentricity, cognitive and perceptual
dysregulation
The DSM-V then oers examples of diagnostic criteria according to this methodology for antisocial PD,
avoidant PD, borderline PD, narcissistic PD, obsessive-compulsive PD, and schizotypal PD, as well as a new
diagnosis of

Personality Disorder - Trait Specied.

Personality Disorder - Trait Specied is diagnosed based

on two criteria. First there must be moderate or greater impairment in the functioning of personality, as
manifested in two or more of the areas identied above as identity, self-direction, empathy, and intimacy.
Second, there must be one or more pathological traits as dened by the 5 domains/25 facets.
So, with three dierent, utilitarian approach to the diagnosis of personality disorders, it is clear that disordered personality development is every bit as complex and fascinating as normal personality development.
This should not be surprising, since individuals are unique and complex, and we all experience dierent lives.
It

will

be quite interesting to see how the DSM-VI handles this issue.

A Final Note
This brief appendix on personality disorders merely scratches the surface of this complex set of psycholog-

ical disorders. For example, it might appear as if Millon's classication system for personality disorders is at
odds with the DSM-IV/DSM-V classication system, and, therefore, Millon himself may be at odds with the
DSM-IV/DSM-V system. Actually, Millon was a member of the DSM-IV Personality Disorders Work Group.
In addition, the DSM-IV included among its criteria sets and axes provided for further study two of the
personality disorders contained within Millon's classication system: the depressive personality disorder and
the passive-aggressive (negativistic) personality disorder. Accordingly, the classication systems continue to
be the subject of ongoing research and potential modication, so much so that the DSM-V actually has two
systems included. It will be years before we begin the hear about the DSM-VI, but it will be very interesting
to see how personality disorders are handled then.
Likewise, although DBT has been very promising in the treatment of borderline personality disorder, there
is less research on specic treatments for other personality disorders. Thus, continued research is necessary,
perhaps including the development of new therapies specic to certain other personality disorders.

20.1 Review of Key Points
•

Personality disorders are enduring patterns of deviant behavior that dier markedly from an individual's
culture.

•

The DSM classication system identies three clusters of personality disorder:

odd/eccentric, dra-

matic/emotional/erratic, and anxious/fearful.

•
•
•

The odd/eccentric personality disorders bear some resemblance to the symptoms of schizophrenia.
The personality disorders within Cluster B appear to involve a signicant gender factor.
Millon has proposed an alternative classication scheme based on an evolutionary model of personality
disorders. He suggests that these disorders represent individual eorts to exist, adapt, replicate, and
abstract within an abnormal developmental environment.

•

Millon's model results in personality disorder clusters based on four factors:

pleasure-deciency,

interpersonal-imbalance, intrapsychic-conict, and structure-defectiveness.

•
•

Personality disorders have traditionally been resistant to psychotherapeutic interventions.
Linehan's dialectical behavior therapy has been quite promising in the treatment of borderline personality disorder. This treatment incorporates Zen mindfulness as an approach to balancing the acceptance
of the individual with the desire/need for change.
