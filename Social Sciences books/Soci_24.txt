Acknowledgements
Thanks to the Open Education Initiative Grant at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, for
providing the funds and support to develop this on-line textbook. It was originally produced for the
course, Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies 187: Gender, Sexuality, and Culture, an introductory-level,
general education, large-lecture course which has reached upwards of 600 students per academic year.
Co-authored by Associate Professor Miliann Kang and graduate teaching assistants Donovan Lessard,
Laura Heston and Sonny Nordmarken, this text draws on the collaborative teaching efforts over many
years in the department of Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies. Many faculty, staff, teaching assistants
and students have developed the course and generously shared teaching materials.
In the past, we have assigned textbooks which cost approximately $75 per book. Many students,
including the many non-traditional and working-class students this course attracts, experienced
financial hardship in purchasing required texts. In addition, the intersectional and interdisciplinary
content of this class is unique and we felt could not be found in any single existing textbook currently on
the market. In recent years, we have attempted to utilize e-reserves for assigned course readings. While
more accessible, students and faculty agree that this approach tends to lack the structure found in a
textbook, as it is difficult for students to complete all assigned readings and they are missing an
anchoring reference text. This situation prompted us to begin drafting this text that we would combine
with other assigned readings and make available as an open source textbook.
While this textbook draws from and engages with the interdisciplinary field of WGSS, it reflects the
disciplinary expertise of the four authors, who are all sociologists. We recognize this as both a strength
and weakness of the text, as it provides a strong sociological approach but does not cover the entire
range of work in the field.
We would like to continue the practice of having our students access online content available in the
University Learning Commons free of charge and hope this resource will be useful to anyone interested
in learning more about the rich, vibrant and important field of Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies.

UNIT I: AN INTRODUCTION TO
WOMEN, GENDER, SEXUALITY
STUDIES: GROUNDING THEORETICAL
FRAMEWORKS AND CONCEPTS

Critical Introduction to the Field
There was a time when it seemed all knowledge was produced by, about, and for men. This was true
from the physical and social sciences to the canons of music and literature. Looking from the angle of
mainstream education, studies, textbooks, and masterpieces were almost all authored by white men. It
was not uncommon for college students to complete entire courses reading only the work of white men
in their fields.
Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies (WGSS) is an interdisciplinary field that challenges the androcentric
production of knowledge. Androcentrism is the privileging of male- and masculine-centered ways of
understanding the world.

Alison Bechdel, a lesbian feminist comics artist, described what has come to be known as “the Bechdel Test,”
which demonstrates the androcentric perspective of a majority of feature-length films. Films only pass the Bechdel
Test if they 1) Feature two women characters, 2) Those two women characters talk to each other, and 3) They talk
to each other about something other than a man. Many people might be surprised to learn that a majority of films
do not pass this test! This demonstrates how androcentrism is pervasive in the film industry and results in malecentered films.

Feminist scholars argue that the common assumption that knowledge is produced by rational, impartial
(male) scientists often obscures the ways that scientists create knowledge through gendered, raced,
classed, and sexualized cultural perspectives (e.g., Scott 1991). Feminist scholars include biologists,
anthropologists, sociologists, historians, chemists, engineers, economists and researchers from just
about any identifiable department at a university. Disciplinary diversity among scholars in this field
facilitates communication across the disciplinary boundaries within the academy to more fully
understand the social world. This text offers a general introduction to the field of Women, Gender,
Sexuality Studies. As all authors of this textbook are trained both as sociologists and interdisciplinary
feminist scholars, we situate our framework, which is heavily shaped by a sociological lens, within
larger interdisciplinary feminist debates. We highlight some of the key areas in the field rather than
comprehensively covering every topic.

Introduction to Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies

The Women’s Liberation Movement and Civil Rights Movement of the mid-20th Century called attention
to these conditions and aimed to address these absences in knowledge. Beginning in the 1970s,
universities across the United States instituted Women’s and Ethnic Studies departments (African
American Studies, Asian American Studies, Latin American Studies, Native American Studies, etc.) in
response to student protests and larger social movements. These departments reclaimed buried
histories and centered the knowledge production of marginalized groups. As white, middle-class,
heterosexual women had the greatest access to education and participation in Women’s Studies, early
incarnations of the field stressed their experiences and perspectives. In subsequent decades, studies
and contributions of women of color, immigrant women, women from the global south, poor and
working class women, and lesbian and queer women became integral to Women’s Studies. More
recently, analyses of disability, sexualities, masculinities, religion, science, gender diversity,
incarceration, indigeneity, and settler colonialism have become centered in the field. As a result of this
opening of the field to incorporate a wider range of experiences and objects of analysis, many Women’s
Studies department are now re-naming themselves “Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies”
departments.
Feminist scholars recognize the inextricable connection between the notions of gender and sexuality in
U.S. society, not only for women but also for men and people of all genders, across a broad expanse of
topics. In an introductory course, you can expect to learn about the impact of stringent beauty
standards produced in media and advertising, why childrearing by women may not be as natural as we
think, the history of the gendered division of labor and its continuing impact on the economic lives of
men and women, the unique health issues addressed by advocates of reproductive justice, the
connections between women working in factories in the global south and women consuming goods in
the United States, how sexual double-standards harm us all, the historical context for feminist
movements and where they are today, and much more.
More than a series of topics, Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies offers a way of seeing the world
differently. Scholars in this field make connections across institutional contexts (work, family, media,
law, the state), value the knowledge that comes from lived experiences, and attend to, rather than
ignore, marginalized identities and groups. Thanks to the important critiques of transnational, postcolonial, queer, trans and feminists of color, most contemporary WGSS scholars strive to see the world
through the lens of intersectionality. That is, they see systems of oppression working in concert rather
than separately. For instance, the way sexism is experienced depends not only on a person’s gender but
also on how the person experiences racism, economic inequality, ageism, and other forms of
marginalization within particular historical and cultural contexts.

Intersectionality can be challenging to understand. This video explains the intersectionality framework using the
example of gender-specific and race-specific anti-discrimination policies that failed to protect Black women.
Can you think of some other contexts in which people who are marginalized in multiple ways might be left out?

Introduction to Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies

Theorizing Lived Experiences
You may have heard the phrase “the personal is political” at some point in your life. This phrase,
popularized by feminists in the 1960s, highlights the ways in which our personal experiences are
shaped by political, economic, and cultural forces within the context of history, institutions, and culture.
Socially-lived theorizing means creating feminist theories and knowledge from the actual day-to-day
experiences of groups of people who have traditionally been excluded from the production of academic
knowledge. A key element to feminist analysis is a commitment to the creation of knowledge grounded
in the experiences of people belonging to marginalized groups, including for example, women, people of
color, people in the Global South, immigrants, indigenous people, gay, lesbian, queer, and trans people,
poor and working-class people, and disabled people.
Feminist theorists and activists argue for theorizing beginning from the experiences of the marginalized
because people with less power and resources often experience the effects of oppressive social systems
in ways that members of dominant groups do not. From the “bottom” of a social system, participants
have knowledge of the power holders of that system as well as their own experiences, while the reverse
is rarely true. Therefore, their experiences allow for a more complete knowledge of the workings of
systems of power. For example, a story of the development of industry in the 19th century told from the
perspective of the owners of factories would emphasize capital accumulation and industrial progress.
However, the development of industry in the 19th century for immigrant workers meant working
sixteen-hour days to feed themselves and their families and fighting for employer recognition of trade
unions so that they could secure decent wages and the eight-hour work day. Depending on which pointof-view you begin with, you will have very different theories of how industrial capitalism developed, and
how it works today.
Feminism is not a single school of thought but encompasses diverse theories and analytical
perspectives—such as socialist feminist theories, radical sex feminist theories, black feminist theories,
queer feminist theories , transfeminist theories, feminist disability theories, and intersectional feminist
theories.

In the video below, “Barbie explains feminist theories,” Cristen, of “Ask Cristen,” defines feminisms generally as a
project that works for the “political, social, and economic equality of the sexes,” and suggests that different types of
feminist propose different sources of gender inequality and solutions. Cristen (with Barbie’s help) identifies and
defines 11 different types of feminism and the solutions they propose:
Liberal feminism
Marxist feminism
Radical feminism
Anti-porn feminism

22

Introduction to Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies

Sex positive feminism
Separatist feminism
Cultural feminism
Womanism (intersectional feminism)
Postcolonial feminism
Ecofeminism
Girlie feminism
What types of feminism do Cristen and Barbie leave out of this list? Do you agree with how they characterize
these types of feminism? Which issues across these feminisms do you think are most important?

The common thread in all these feminist theories is the belief that knowledge is shaped by the political
and social context in which it is made (Scott 1991). Acknowledging that all knowledge is constructed by

23

that

Introduction to Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies

reflexivity—understanding how one’s social position influences the ways that they understand the
world—is of utmost necessity when creating theory and knowledge. As people occupy particular social
locations in terms of race, class, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, age, and ability, these multiple identities
in combination all at the same time shape their social experiences. At certain times, specific dimensions
of their identities may be more salient than at others, but at no time is anyone without multiple
identities. Thus, categories of identity are intersectional, influencing the experiences that individuals
have and the ways they see and understand the world around them.
In the United States, we often are taught to think that people are self-activating, self-actualizing
individuals. We repeatedly hear that everyone is unique and that everyone has an equal chance to make
something of themselves. While feminists also believe that people have agency—or the ability to
influence the direction of their lives—they also argue that an individual’s agency is limited or enhanced
by their social position. A powerful way to understand oneself and one’s multiple identities is to situate
one’s experiences within multiple levels of analysis—micro – (individual), meso- (group), macro(structural), and global. These levels of analysis offer different analytical approaches to understanding
a social phenomenon. Connecting personal experiences to larger, structural forces of race, gender,
ethnicity, class, sexuality, and ability allows for a more powerful understanding of how our own lives are
shaped by forces greater than ourselves, and how we might work to change these larger forces of
inequality. Like a microscope that is initially set on a view of the most minute parts of a cell, moving
back to see the whole of the cell, and then pulling one’s eye away from the microscope to see the whole
of the organism, these levels of analysis allow us to situate day-to-day experiences and phenomena
within broader, structural processes that shape whole populations. The micro level is that which we, as
individuals, live everyday—interacting with other people on the street, in the classroom, or while we are
at a party or a social gathering. Therefore, the micro-level is the level of analysis focused on individuals’
experiences. The meso level of analysis moves the microscope back, seeing how groups, communities
and organizations structure social life. A meso level-analysis might look at how churches shape gender
expectations for women, how schools teach students to become girls and boys, or how workplace
policies make gender transition and recognition either easier or harder for trans and gender
nonconforming workers. The macro level consists of government policies, programs, and institutions,
as well as ideologies and categories of identity. In this way, the macro level involves national power
structures as well as cultural ideas about different groups of people according to race, class, gender,
and sexuality spread through various national institutions, such as media, education and policy. Finally,
the global level of analysis includes transnational production, trade, and migration, global capitalism,
and transnational trade and law bodies (such as the International Monetary Fund, the United Nations,
the World Trade Organization)—larger transnational forces that bear upon our personal lives but that
we often ignore or fail to see.

How Macro Structures Impact People: Maquiladoras
Applying multiple levels of analysis, let’s look at the experiences of a Latina working in a maquiladora, a factory
24

Introduction to Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies

on the border of the US and Mexico. These factories were built to take advantage of the difference in the price of
labor in these two countries. At the micro level, we can see the worker’s daily struggles to feed herself and her
family. We can see how exhausted she is from working every day for more than eight hours and then coming home
to care for herself and her family. Perhaps we could examine how she has developed a persistent cough or skin
problems from working with the chemicals in the factory and using water contaminated with run-off from the
factory she lives near. On the meso-level, we can see how the community that she lives within has been transformed
by the maquiladora, and how other women in her community face similar financial, health, and environmental
problems. We may also see how these women are organizing together to attempt to form a union that can press for
higher wages and benefits. Moving to the macro and global levels, we can situate these experiences within the
Mexican government’s participation within global and regional trade agreements such as the North American Free
Trade Act (NAFTA) and the Central American Free Trade Act (CAFTA) and their negative effects on environmental
regulations and labor laws, as well as the effects of global capitalist restructuring that has shifted production from
North America and Europe to Central and South America and Asia. For further discussion, see the textbook section
on globalization.

Recognizing how forces greater than ourselves operate in shaping the successes and failures we
typically attribute to individual decisions allows us see how inequalities are patterned by race, class,
gender, and sexuality—not just by individual decisions. Approaching these issues through multiple
levels of analysis—at the micro, meso, and macro/global levels—gives a more integrative and complete
understanding of both personal experience and the ways in which macro structures affect the people
who live within them. Through looking at labor in a maquiladora through multiple levels of analysis we
are able to connect what are experienced at the micro level as personal problems to macro economic,
cultural, and social problems. This not only gives us the ability to develop socially-lived theory, but also
allows us to organize with other people who feel similar effects from the same economic, cultural, and
social problems in order to challenge and change these problems.

Introduction to Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies

Identity Terms
Language is political, hotly contested, always evolving, and deeply personal to each person who chooses
the terms with which to identify themselves. To demonstrate respect and awareness of these
complexities, it is important to be attentive to language and to honor and use individuals’ selfreferential terms (Farinas and Farinas 2015). Below are some common identity terms and their
meanings. This discussion is not meant to be definitive or prescriptive but rather aims to highlight the
stakes of language and the debates and context surrounding these terms, and to assist in understanding
terms that frequently come up in classroom discussions. While there are no strict rules about “correct”
or “incorrect” language, these terms reflect much more than personal preferences. They reflect
individual and collective histories, ongoing scholarly debates, and current politics.

“People of color” vs. “Colored people”

People of color is a contemporary term used mainly in the United States to refer to all individuals who
are non-white (Safire 1988). It is a political, coalitional term, as it encompasses common experiences of
racism. People of color is abbreviated as POC. Black or African American are commonly the
preferred terms for most individuals of African descent today. These are widely used terms, though
sometimes they obscure the specificity of individuals’ histories. Other preferred terms are African
diasporic or African descent, to refer, for example, to people who trace their lineage to Africa but
migrated through Latin America and the Caribbean. Colored people is an antiquated term used before
the civil rights movement in the United States and the United Kingdom to refer pejoratively to
individuals of African descent. The term is now taken as a slur, as it represents a time when many forms
of institutional racism during the Jim Crow era were legal.

“Disabled people” vs. “People with disabilities”

Some people prefer person-first phrasing, while others prefer identity-first phrasing. People-first
language linguistically puts the person before their impairment (physical, sensory or mental
difference). Example: “a woman with a vision impairment.” This terminology encourages nondisabled
people to think of those with disabilities as people (Logsdon 2016). The acronym PWD stands for
“people with disabilities.” Although it aims to humanize, people-first language has been critiqued for
26

Introduction to Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies

aiming to create distance from the impairment, which can be understood as devaluing the impairment.
Those who prefer identity-first language often emphasize embracing their impairment as an integral,
important, valued aspect of themselves, which they do not want to distance themselves from. Example:
“a disabled person.” Using this language points to how society disables individuals (Liebowitz 2015).
Many terms in common use have ableist meanings, such as evaluative expressions like “lame,”
“retarded,” “crippled,” and “crazy.” It is important to avoid using these terms. Although in the case of
disability, both people-first and disability-first phrasing are currently in use, as mentioned above, this is
not the case when it comes to race.

“Transgender,” vs. “Transgendered,” “Trans,” “Trans*,” “Non-binary,” “Genderqueer,”
“Genderfluid,” “Agender,” “Transsexual,” “Cisgender,” “Cis”

Transgender generally refers to individuals who identify as a gender not assigned to them at birth. The
term is used as an adjective (i.e., “a transgender woman,” not “a transgender”), however some
individuals describe themselves by using transgender as a noun. The term transgendered is not
preferred because it emphasizes ascription and undermines self-definition. Trans is an abbreviated
term and individuals appear to use it self-referentially these days more often than transgender.
Transition is both internal and social. Some individuals who transition do not experience a change in
their gender identity since they have always identified in the way that they do. Trans* is an all-inclusive
umbrella term which encompasses all nonnormative gender identities (Tompkins 2014). Non-binary
and genderqueer refer to gender identities beyond binary identifications of man or woman. The term
genderqueer became popularized within queer and trans communities in the 1990s and 2000s, and the
term non-binary became popularized in the 2010s (Roxie 2011). Agender, meaning “without gender,”
can describe people who do not have a gender identity, while others identify as non-binary or gender
neutral, have an undefinable identity, or feel indifferent about gender (Brooks 2014). Genderfluid
people experience shifts between gender identities. The term transsexual is a medicalized term, and
indicates a binary understanding of gender and an individual’s identification with the “opposite” gender
from the gender assigned to them at birth. Cisgender or cis refers to individuals who identify with the
gender assigned to them at birth. Some people prefer the term non-trans. Additional gender identity
terms exist; these are just a few basic and commonly used terms. Again, the emphasis of these terms is
on viewing individuals as they view themselves and using their self-designated names and pronouns.

“Queer,” “Bisexual,” “Pansexual,” “Polyamorous,” “Asexual,”

Queer as an identity term refers to a non-categorical sexual identity; it is also used as a catch-all term
27

Introduction to Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies

for all LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer) individuals. The term was historically
used in a derogatory way, but was reclaimed as a self-referential term in the 1990s United States.
Although many individuals identify as queer today, some still feel personally insulted by it and
disapprove of its use. Bisexual is typically defined as a sexual orientation marked by attraction to
either men or women. This has been problematized as a binary approach to sexuality, which excludes
individuals who do not identify as men or women. Pansexual is a sexual identity marked by sexual
attraction to people of any gender or sexuality. Polyamorous (poly, for short) or non-monogamous
relationships are open or non-exclusive; individuals may have multiple consensual and individuallynegotiated sexual and/or romantic relationships at once (Klesse 2006). Asexual is an identity marked by
a lack of or rare sexual attraction, or low or absent interest in sexual activity, abbreviated to “ace”
(Decker 2014). Asexuals distinguish between sexual and romantic attraction, delineating various subidentities included under an ace umbrella. In several later sections of this book, we discuss the terms
heteronormativity, homonormativity, and homonationalism; these terms are not self-referential
identity descriptors but are used to describe how sexuality is constructed in society and the politics
around such constructions.

“Latino,” “Latin American,” “Latina,” “Latino/a,” “Latin@,” “Latinx,” “Chicano,” “Xicano,”
“Chicana,” “Chicano/a,” “Chican@,” “Chicanx,” “Mexican American,” “Hispanic”

Latino is a term used to describe people of Latin American origin or descent in the United States, while
Latin American describes people in Latin America. Latino can refer specifically to a man of Latin
American origin or descent; Latina refers specifically to a woman of Latin American origin or descent.
The terms Latino/a and Latin@ include both the –o and –a endings to avoid the sexist use of “Latino”
to refer to all individuals. Chicano, Chicano/a, and Chican@ similarly describe people of Mexican
origin or descent in the United States, and may be used interchangeably with Mexican American,
Xicano or Xicano/a. However, as Chicano has the connotation of being politically active in working to
end oppression of Mexican Americans, and is associated with the Chicano literary and civil rights
movements of the 1960s and 1970s, people may prefer the use of either Chicano or Mexican
American, depending on their political orientation. Xicano is a shortened form of Mexicano, from the
Nahuatl name for the indigenous Mexica Aztec Empire. Some individuals prefer the Xicano spelling to
emphasize their indigenous ancestry (Revilla 2004). Latinx and Chicanx avoid either the –a or the –o
gendered endings to explicitly include individuals of all genders (Ramirez and Blay 2017). Hispanic
refers to the people and nations with a historical link to Spain and to people of country heritage who
speak the Spanish language. Although many people can be considered both Latinx and Hispanic,
Brazilians, for example, are Latin American but neither Hispanic nor Latino, while Spaniards are
Hispanic but not Latino. Preferred terms vary regionally and politically; these terms came into use in
the context of the Anglophone-dominated United States.

28

Introduction to Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies

“Indigenous,” “First Nations,” “Indian,” “Native,” “Native American,” “American Indian,”
“Aboriginal”

Indigenous refers to descendants of the original inhabitants of an area, in contrast to those that have
settled, occupied or colonized the area (Turner 2006). Terms vary by specificity; for example, in
Australia, individuals are Aboriginal, while those in Canada are First Nations. “Aboriginal” is
sometimes used in the Canadian context, too, though more commonly in settler-government documents,
not so much as a term of self-definition. In the United States, individuals may refer to themselves as
Indian, American Indian, Native, or Native American, or, perhaps more commonly, they may refer
to their specific tribes or nations. Because of the history of the term, “Indian,” like other reclaimed
terms, outsiders should be very careful in using it.

“Global South,” “Global North,” “Third world,” “First world,” “Developing country,”
“Developed country”

Global South and Global North refer to socioeconomic and political divides. Areas of the Global
South, which are typically socioeconomically and politically disadvantaged are Africa, Latin America,
parts of Asia, and the Middle East. Generally, Global North areas, including the United States, Canada,
Western Europe and parts of East Asia, are typically socioeconomically and politically advantaged.
Terms like Third world, First world, Developing country, and Developed country have been
problematized for their hierarchical meanings, where areas with more resources and political power are
valued over those with less resources and less power (Silver 2015). Although the terms Global South
and Global North carry the same problematic connotations, these tend to be the preferred terms
today. In addition, although the term Third world has been problematized, some people do not see
Third world as a negative term and use it self-referentially. Also, Third world was historically used as
an oppositional and coalitional term for nations and groups who were non-aligned with either the
capitalist First world and communist Second world especially during the Cold War. For example,
those who participated in the Third World Liberation Strike at San Francisco State University from
1968 to 1969 used the term to express solidarity and to establish Black Studies and the Ethnic Studies
College (Springer 2008). We use certain terms, like Global North/South, throughout the book, with
the understanding that there are problematic aspects of these usages.

“Transnational,” “Diasporic,” “Global,” “Globalization”
29

Transnational has been variously defined. Transnational describes migration and the transcendence of
borders, signals the diminishing relevance of the nation-state in the current iteration of globalization, is
used interchangeably with diasporic (any reference to materials from a region outside its current
location), designates a form of neocolonialism (e.g., transnational capital) and signals the NGOization of
social movements. For Inderpal Grewal and Caren Kaplan (2001), the terms “transnational women’s
movements” or “global women’s movements” are used to refer to U.N. conferences on women, global
feminism as a policy and activist arena, and human rights initiatives that enact new forms of
governmentality. Chandra Mohanty (2003) has argued that transnational feminist scholarship and social
movements critique and mobilize against globalization, capitalism, neoliberalism, neocolonialism, and
non-national institutions like the World Trade Organization. In this sense, transnational refers to “crossnational solidarity” in feminist organizing. Grewal and Caplan (2001) have observed that transnational
feminist inquiry also examines how these movements have been tied to colonial processes and
imperialism, as national and international histories shape transnational social movements. In feminist
politics and studies, the term transnational is used much more than “international,” which has been
critiqued because it centers the nation-state. Whereas transnational can also take seriously the role of
the state it does not assume that the state is the most relevant actor in global processes. Although all of
these are technically global processes, the term “global” is oftentimes seen as abstract. It appeals to the
notion of “global sisterhood,” which is often suspect because of the assumption of commonalities among
women that often times do not exist.

Conceptualizing Structures of Power
A social structure is a set of long-lasting social relationships, practices and institutions that can be
difficult to see at work in our daily lives. They are intangible social relations, but work much in the same
way as structures we can see: buildings and skeletal systems are two examples. The human body is
structured by bones; that is to say that the rest of our bodies’ organs and vessels are where they are
because bones provide the structure upon which these other things can reside. Structures limit
possibility, but they are not fundamentally unchangeable. For instance, our bones may deteriorate over
time, suffer acute injuries, or be affected by disease, but they never spontaneously change location or
disappear into thin air. Such is the way with social structures.

The elements of a social structure, the parts of social life that direct possible actions, are the
institutions of society. These will be addressed in more detail later, but for now social institutions may
be understood to include: the government, work, education, family, law, media, and medicine, among
others. To say these institutions direct, or structure, possible social action, means that within the
confines of these spaces there are rules, norms, and procedures that limit what actions are possible. For
instance, family is a concept near and dear to most, but historically and culturally family forms have
been highly specified, that is structured. According to Dorothy Smith (1993), the standard North
American family (or, SNAF) includes two heterosexually-married parents and one or more biologicallyrelated children. It also includes a division of labor in which the husband/father earns a larger income
and the wife/mother takes responsibility for most of the care-taking and childrearing. Although families
vary in all sorts of ways, this is the norm to which they are most often compared. Thus, while we may
31

Introduction to Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies

consider our pets, friends, and lovers as family, the state, the legal system, and the media do not affirm
these possibilities in the way they affirm the SNAF. In turn, when most people think of who is in their
family, the normative notion of parents and children structures who they consider.
Overlaying these social structures are structures of power. By power we mean two things: 1) access
to and through the various social institutions mentioned above, and 2) processes of privileging,
normalizing, and valuing certain identities over others. This definition of power highlights the
structural, institutional nature of power, while also highlighting the ways in which culture works in the
creation and privileging of certain categories of people. Power in American society is organized along
the axes of gender, race, class, sexuality, ability, age, nation, and religious identities. Some identities
are more highly valued, or more normalized, than others—typically because they are contrasted to
identities thought to be less valuable or less “normal.” Thus, identities are not only descriptors of
individuals, but grant a certain amount of collective access to the institutions of social life. This is not to
say, for instance, that all white people are alike and wield the same amount of power over all people of
color. It does mean that white, middle-class women as a group tend to hold more social power than
middle-class women of color. This is where the concept of intersectionality is key. All individuals have
multiple aspects of identity, and simultaneously experience some privileges due to their socially valued
identity statuses and disadvantages due to their devalued identity statuses. Thus a white, heterosexual
middle-class woman may be disadvantaged compared to a white middle-class man, but she may
experience advantages in different contexts in relation to a black, heterosexual middle-class woman, or
a white, heterosexual working-class man, or a white lesbian upper-class woman.

At the higher level of social structure, we can see that some people have greater access to resources
and institutionalized power across the board than do others. Sexism is the term we use for
discrimination and blocked access women face. Genderism describes discrimination and blocked
access that transgender people face. Racism describes discrimination and blocked access on the basis
of race, which is based on socially-constructed meanings rather than biological differences. Classism
describes discrimination on the basis of social class, or blocked access to material wealth and social
status. Ableism describes discrimination on the basis of physical, mental, or emotional impairment or
blocked access to the fulfillment of needs and in particular, full participation in social life. These “-isms”
reflect dominant cultural notions that women, trans people, people of color, poor people, and disabled
people are inferior to men, non-trans people, white people, middle- and upper-class people, and nondisabled people. Yet, the “-isms” are greater than individuals’ prejudice against women, trans people,
people of color, the poor, and disabled people. For instance, in the founding of the United States the
institutions of social life, including work, law, education, and the like, were built to benefit wealthy,
white men since at the time these were, by law, the only real “citizens” of the country. Although these
institutions have significantly changed over time in response to social movements and more progressive
cultural shifts, their sexist, genderist, racist, classist, and ableist structures continue to persist in
different forms today. Similar-sounding to “-isms,” the language of “-ization,” such as in “racialization”
is used to highlight the formation or processes by which these forms of difference have been given
meaning and power (Omi and Winant 1986). (See further discussion on this process in the section below

on social construction).
Just like the human body’s skeletal structure, social structures are not immutable, or completely
resistant to change. Social movements mobilized on the basis of identities have fought for increased
equality and changed the structures of society, in the US and abroad, over time. However, these
struggles do not change society overnight; some struggles last decades, centuries, or remain always
unfinished. The structures and institutions of social life change slowly, but they can and do change
based on the concerted efforts of individuals, social movements and social institutions.

34

Social Constructionism
Social constructionism is a theory of knowledge that holds that characteristics typically thought to be
immutable and solely biological—such as gender, race, class, ability, and sexuality—are products of
human definition and interpretation shaped by cultural and historical contexts (Subramaniam 2010). As
such, social constructionism highlights the ways in which cultural categories—like “men,” “women,”
“black,” “white”—are concepts created, changed, and reproduced through historical processes within
institutions and culture. We do not mean to say that bodily variation among individuals does not exist,
but that we construct categories based on certain bodily features, we attach meanings to these
categories, and then we place people into the categories by considering their bodies or bodily aspects.
For example, by the one-drop rule (see also page 35), regardless of their appearance, individuals with
any African ancestor are considered black. In contrast, racial conceptualization and thus racial
categories are different in Brazil, where many individuals with African ancestry are considered to be
white. This shows how identity categories are not based on strict biological characteristics, but on the
social perceptions and meanings that are assumed. Categories are not “natural” or fixed and the
boundaries around them are always shifting—they are contested and redefined in different historical
periods and across different societies. Therefore , the social constructionist perspective is concerned
with the meaning created through defining and categorizing groups of people, experience, and reality in
cultural contexts.

The Social Construction of Heterosexuality
What does it mean to be “heterosexual” in contemporary US society? Did it mean the same thing in the late 19th
century? As historian of human sexuality Jonathon Ned Katz shows in The Invention of Heterosexuality (1999), the
word “heterosexual” was originally coined by Dr. James Kiernan in 1892, but its meaning and usage differed
drastically from contemporary understandings of the term. Kiernan thought of “hetero-sexuals” as not defined by
their attraction to the opposite sex, but by their “inclinations to both sexes.” Furthermore, Kiernan thought of the
heterosexual as someone who “betrayed inclinations to ‘abnormal methods of gratification’” (Katz 1995). In other
words, heterosexuals were those who were attracted to both sexes and engaged in sex for pleasure, not for
reproduction. Katz further points out that this definition of the heterosexual lasted within middle-class cultures in
the United States until the 1920s, and then went through various radical reformulations up to the current usage.
Looking at this historical example makes visible the process of the social construction of heterosexuality. First of
all, the example shows how social construction occurs within institutions—in this case, a medical doctor created a
new category to describe a particular type of sexuality, based on existing medical knowledge at the time. “Heterosexuality” was initially a medical term that defined a deviant type of sexuality. Second, by seeing how Kiernan—and
middle class culture, more broadly—defined “hetero-sexuality” in the 19th century, it is possible to see how
drastically the meanings of the concept have changed over time. Typically, in the United States in contemporary
usage, “heterosexuality” is thought to mean “normal” or “good”—it is usually the invisible term defined by what is
thought to be its opposite, homosexuality. However, in its initial usage, “hetero-sexuality” was thought to counter
the norm of reproductive sexuality and be, therefore, deviant. This gets to the third aspect of social constructionism.
35

Introduction to Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies

That is, cultural and historical contexts shape our definition and understanding of concepts. In this case, the norm
of reproductive sexuality—having sex not for pleasure, but to have children—defines what types of sexuality are
regarded as “normal” or “deviant.” Fourth, this case illustrates how categorization shapes human experience,
behavior, and interpretation of reality. To be a “heterosexual” in middle class culture in the US in the early 1900s
was not something desirable to be—it was not an identity that most people would have wanted to inhabit. The very
definition of “hetero-sexual” as deviant, because it violated reproductive sexuality, defined “proper” sexual behavior
as that which was reproductive and not pleasure-centered.

Social constructionist approaches to understanding the world challenge the essentialist or biological
determinist understandings that typically underpin the “common sense” ways in which we think about
race, gender, and sexuality. Essentialism is the idea that the characteristics of persons or groups are
significantly influenced by biological factors, and are therefore largely similar in all human cultures and
historical periods. A key assumption of essentialism is that “a given truth is a necessary natural part of
the individual and object in question” (Gordon and Abbott 2002). In other words, an essentialist
understanding of sexuality would argue that not only do all people have a sexual orientation, but that an
individual’s sexual orientation does not vary across time or place. In this example, “sexual orientation”
is a given “truth” to individuals—it is thought to be inherent, biologically determined, and essential to
their being.
Essentialism typically relies on a biological determinist theory of identity. Biological determinism can
be defined as a general theory, which holds that a group’s biological or genetic makeup shapes its
social, political, and economic destiny (Subramaniam 2014). For example, “sex” is typically thought to
be a biological “fact,” where bodies are classified into two categories, male and female. Bodies in these
categories are assumed to have “sex”-distinct chromosomes, reproductive systems, hormones, and sex
characteristics. However, “sex” has been defined in many different ways, depending on the context
within which it is defined. For example, feminist law professor Julie Greenberg (2002) writes that in the
late 19th century and early 20th century, “when reproductive function was considered one of a woman’s
essential characteristics, the medical community decided that the presence or absence of ovaries was
the ultimate criterion of sex” (Greenberg 2002: 113). Thus, sexual difference was produced through the
heteronormative assumption that women are defined by their ability to have children. Instead of
assigning sex based on the presence or absence of ovaries, medical practitioners in the contemporary
US typically assign sex based on the appearance of genitalia.
Differential definitions of sex point to two other primary aspects of the social construction of reality.
First, it makes apparent how even the things commonly thought to be “natural” or “essential” in the
world are socially constructed. Understandings of “nature” change through history and across place
according to systems of human knowledge. Second, the social construction of difference occurs within
relations of power and privilege. Sociologist Abby Ferber (2009) argues that these two aspects of the
social construction of difference cannot be separated, but must be understood together. Discussing the
construction of racial difference, she argues that inequality and oppression actually produce ideas of
essential racial difference. Therefore, racial categories that are thought to be “natural” or “essential”
36

Introduction to Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies

are created within the context of racialized power relations—in the case of African-Americans, that
includes slavery, laws regulating interracial sexual relationships, lynching, and white supremacist
discourse. Social constructionist analyses seek to better understand the processes through which
racialized, gendered, or sexualized differentiations occur, in order to untangle the power relations
within them.
Notions of disability are similarly socially constructed within the context of ableist power relations. The
medical model of disability frames body and mind differences and perceived challenges as flaws that
need fixing at the individual level. The social model of disability shifts the focus to the disabling
aspects of society for individuals with impairments (physical, sensory or mental differences), where
the society disables those with impairments (Shakespeare 2006). Disability, then, refers to a form of
oppression where individuals understood as having impairments are imagined to be inferior to those
without impairments, and impairments are devalued and unwanted. This perspective manifests in
structural arrangements that limit access for those with impairments. A critical disability perspective
critiques the idea that nondisability is natural and normal—an ableist sentiment, which frames the
person rather than the society as the problem.
What are the implications of a social constructionist approach to understanding the world? Because
social constructionist analyses examine categories of difference as fluid, dynamic, and changing
according to historical and geographical context, a social constructionist perspective suggests that
existing inequalities are neither inevitable nor immutable. This perspective is especially useful for the
activist and emancipatory aims of feminist movements and theories. By centering the processes through
which inequality and power relations produce racialized, sexualized, and gendered difference, social
constructionist analyses challenge the pathologization of minorities who have been thought to be
essentially or inherently inferior to privileged groups. Additionally, social constructionist analyses
destabilize the categories that organize people into hierarchically ordered groups through uncovering
the historical, cultural, and/or institutional origins of the groups under study. In this way, social
constructionist analyses challenge the categorical underpinnings of inequalities by revealing their
production and reproduction through unequal systems of knowledge and power.

Intersectionality
Articulated by legal scholar Kimberlé Crenshaw (1991), the concept of intersectionality identifies a
mode of analysis integral to women, gender, sexuality studies. Within intersectional frameworks, race,
class, gender, sexuality, age, ability, and other aspects of identity are considered mutually constitutive;
that is, people experience these multiple aspects of identity simultaneously and the meanings of
different aspects of identity are shaped by one another. In other words, notions of gender and the way a
person’s gender is interpreted by others are always impacted by notions of race and the way that
person’s race is interpreted. For example, a person is never received as just a woman, but how that
person is racialized impacts how the person is received as a woman. So, notions of blackness,
brownness, and whiteness always influence gendered experience, and there is no experience of gender
that is outside of an experience of race. In addition to race, gendered experience is also shaped by age,
sexuality, class, and ability; likewise, the experience of race is impacted by gender, age, class, sexuality,
and ability.

Understanding intersectionality requires a particular way of thinking. It is different than how many
people imagine identities operate. An intersectional analysis of identity is distinct from singledeterminant identity models and additive models of identity. A single determinant model of identity
presumes that one aspect of identity, say, gender, dictates one’s access to or disenfranchisement from
power. An example of this idea is the concept of “global sisterhood,” or the idea that all women across
the globe share some basic common political interests, concerns, and needs (Morgan 1996). If women in
different locations did share common interests, it would make sense for them to unite on the basis of
gender to fight for social changes on a global scale. Unfortunately, if the analysis of social problems
stops at gender, what is missed is an attention to how various cultural contexts shaped by race, religion,
and access to resources may actually place some women’s needs at cross-purposes to other women’s
needs. Therefore, this approach obscures the fact that women in different social and geographic
locations face different problems. Although many white, middle-class women activists of the mid-20th
century US fought for freedom to work and legal parity with men, this was not the major problem for
women of color or working-class white women who had already been actively participating in the US

39

Introduction to Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies

labor market as domestic workers, factory workers, and slave laborers since early US colonial
settlement. Campaigns for women’s equal legal rights and access to the labor market at the
international level are shaped by the experience and concerns of white American women, while women
of the global south, in particular, may have more pressing concerns: access to clean water, access to
adequate health care, and safety from the physical and psychological harms of living in tyrannical, wartorn, or economically impoverished nations.

In contrast to the single-determinant identity model, the additive model of identity simply adds
together privileged and disadvantaged identities for a slightly more complex picture. For instance, a
Black man may experience some advantages based on his gender, but has limited access to power
based on his race. This kind of analysis is exemplified in how race and gender wage gaps are portrayed
in statistical studies and popular news reports. Below, you can see a median wage gap table from the
Institute for Women’s Policy Research compiled in 2009. In reading the table, it can be seen that the
gender wage gap is such that in 2009, overall, women earned 77% of what men did in the US. The table
breaks down the information further to show that earnings varied not only by gender but by race as
well. Thus, Hispanic or Latino women earned only 52.9% of what white men did while white women
made 75%. This is certainly more descriptive than a single gender wage gap figure or a single race
wage gap figure. The table is useful at pointing to potential structural explanations that may make
earnings differ between groups. For instance, looking at the chart, you may immediately wonder why
these gaps exist; is it a general difference of education levels, occupations, regions of residence or skill
levels between groups, or is it something else, such as discrimination in hiring and promotion? What it
is not useful for is predicting people’s incomes by plugging in their gender plus their race, even though
it may be our instinct to do so. Individual experiences differ vastly and for a variety of reasons; there
are outliers in every group. Most importantly, even if this chart helps in understanding structural
reasons why incomes differ, it doesn’t provide all the answers.

The additive model does not take into account how our shared cultural ideas of gender are racialized
and our ideas of race are gendered and that these ideas structure access to resources and
power—material, political, interpersonal. Sociologist Patricia Hill Collins (2005) has developed a strong

42

Introduction to Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies

intersectional framework through her discussion of race, gender, and sexuality in her historical analysis
of representations of Black sexuality in the US. Hill Collins shows how contemporary white American
culture exoticizes Black men and women and she points to a history of enslavement and treatment as
chattel as the origin and motivator for the use of these images. In order to justify slavery, AfricanAmericans were thought of and treated as less than human. Sexual reproduction was often forced
among slaves for the financial benefit of plantation owners, but owners reframed this coercion and rape
as evidence of the “natural” and uncontrollable sexuality of people from the African continent. Images
of Black men and women were not completely the same, as Black men were constructed as hypersexual
“bucks” with little interest in continued relationships whereas Black women were framed as
hypersexual “Jezebels” that became the “matriarchs” of their families. Again, it is important to note how
the context, where enslaved families were often forcefully dismantled, is often left unacknowledged and
contemporary racialized constructions are assumed and framed as individual choices or traits. It is
shockingly easy to see how these images are still present in contemporary media, culture, and politics,
for instance, in discussions of American welfare programs. This analysis reveals how race, gender, and
sexuality intersect. We cannot simply pull these identities apart because they are interconnected and
mutually enforcing.
Although the framework of intersectional has contributed important insights to feminist analyses, there
are problems. Intersectionality refers to the mutually co-constitutive nature of multiple aspects of
identity, yet in practice this term is typically used to signify the specific difference of “women of color,”
which effectively produces women of color (and in particular, Black women) as Other and again centers
white women (Puar 2012). In addition, the framework of intersectionality was created in the context of
the United States; therefore, the use of the framework reproduces the United States as the dominant
site of feminist inquiry and women’s studies’ Euro-American bias (Puar 2012). Another failing of
intersectionality is its premise of fixed categories of identity, where descriptors like race, gender, class,
and sexuality are assumed to be stable. In contrast, the notion of assemblage considers categories
events, actions, and encounters between bodies, rather than simply attributes (Puar 2012). Assemblage
refers to a collage or collection of things, or the act of assembling. An assemblage perspective
emphasizes how relations, patterns, and connections between concepts give concepts meaning (Puar
2012). Although assemblage has been framed against intersectionality, identity categories’ mutual coconstitution is accounted for in both intersectionality and assemblage.
“Gender” is too often used simply and erroneously to mean “white women,” while “race” too often
connotes “Black men.” An intersectional perspective examines how identities are related to each other
in our own experiences and how the social structures of race, class, gender, sexuality, age, and ability
intersect for everyone. As opposed to single-determinant and additive models of identity, an
intersectional approach develops a more sophisticated understanding of the world and how individuals
in differently situated social groups experience differential access to both material and symbolic
resources.

UNIT II: CHALLENGING BINARY
SYSTEMS AND CONSTRUCTIONS OF
DIFFERENCE

Introduction: Binary Systems
Black and white. Masculine and feminine. Rich and poor. Straight and gay. Able-bodied and disabled.
Binaries are social constructs composed of two parts that are framed as absolute and unchanging
opposites. Binary systems reflect the integration of these oppositional ideas into our culture. This
results in an exaggeration of differences between social groups until they seem to have nothing in
common. An example of this is the phrase “men are from Mars, women are from Venus.” Ideas of men
and women being complete opposites invite simplistic comparisons that rely on stereotypes: men are
practical, women are emotional; men are strong, women are weak; men lead, women support. Binary
notions mask the complicated realities and variety in the realm of social identity. They also erase the
existence of individuals, such as multiracial or mixed-race people and people with non-binary gender
identities, who may identify with neither of the assumed categories or with multiple categories. We
know very well that men have emotions and that women have physical strength, but a binary
perspective of gender prefigures men and women to have nothing in common. They are defined against
each other; men are defined, in part, as “not women” and women as “not men.” Thus, our
understandings of men are influenced by our understandings of women. Rather than seeing aspects of
identity like race, gender, class, ability, and sexuality as containing only two dichotomous, opposing
categories, conceptualizing multiple various identities allows us to examine how men and women, Black
and white, etc., may not be so completely different after all, and how varied and complex identities and
lives can be.

The Sex/Gender/Sexuality System
The phrase “sex/gender system,” or “sex/gender/sexuality system” was coined by Gayle Rubin
(1984) to describe, “the set of arrangements by which a society transforms biological sexuality into
products of human activity.” That is, Rubin proposed that the links between biological sex, social
gender, and sexual attraction are products of culture. Gender is, in this case, “the social product” that
we attach to notions of biological sex. In our heteronormative culture, everyone is assumed to be
heterosexual (attracted to men if you are a woman; attracted to women if you are a man) until stated
otherwise. People make assumptions about how others should act in social life, and to whom they
should be attracted, based on their perceptions of outward bodily appearance, which is assumed to
represent biological sex characteristics (chromosomes, hormones, secondary sex characteristics and
genitalia). Rubin questioned the biological determinist argument that suggested all people assigned
female at birth will identify as women and be attracted to men. According to a biological determinist
view, where “biology is destiny,” this is the way nature intended. However, this view fails to account for
human intervention. As human beings, we have an impact on the social arrangements of society. Social
constructionists believe that many things we typically leave unquestioned as conventional ways of life
actually reflect historically- and culturally-rooted power relationships between groups of people, which
are reproduced in part through socialization processes, where we learn conventional ways of thinking
and behaving from our families and communities. Just because female-assigned people bear children
does not necessarily mean that they are always by definition the best caretakers of those children or
that they have “natural instincts” that male-assigned people lack.

For instance, the arrangement of women caring for children has a historical legacy (which we will
discuss more in the section on gendered labor markets). We see not only mothers but other women too
caring for children: daycare workers, nannies, elementary school teachers, and babysitters. What these
jobs have in common is that they are all very female-dominated occupations AND that this work is
economically undervalued. These people do not get paid very well. One study found that, in New York
City, parking lot attendants, on average, make more money than childcare workers (Clawson and
Gerstel, 2002). Because “mothering” is not seen as work, but as a woman’s “natural” behavior, she is
not compensated in a way that reflects how difficult the work is. If you have ever babysat for a full day,
go ahead and multiply that by eighteen years and then try to make the argument that it is not work.
Men can do this work just as well as women, but there are no similar cultural dictates that say they
should. On top of that, some suggest that if paid caretakers were mostly men, then they would make
much more money. In fact, men working in female-dominated occupations actually earn more and gain
promotions faster than women. This phenomenon is referred to as the glass escalator. This example
illustrates how, as social constructionist Abby Ferber (2009) argues, social systems produce differences
between men and women, and not the reverse.

Introduction to Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies

Gender and Sex – Transgender and
Intersex
A binary gender perspective assumes that only men and women exist, obscuring gender diversity and
erasing the existence of people who do not identify as men or women. A gendered assumption in our
culture is that someone assigned female at birth will identify as a woman and that all women were
assigned female at birth. While this is true for cisgender (or “cis”) individuals—people who identify in
accordance with their gender assignment—it is not the case for everyone. Some people assigned male
at birth identify as women, some people assigned female identify as men, and some people identify as
neither women nor men. This illustrates the difference between, gender assignment, which doctors
place on infants (and fetuses) based on the appearance of genitalia, and gender identity, which one
discerns about oneself. The existence of transgender people, or individuals who do not identify with
the gender they were assigned at birth, challenges the very idea of a single sex/gender identity. For
example, trans women, women whose bodies were assigned male and who identify as women, show us
that not all women are born with female-assigned bodies. The fact that trans people exist contests the
biological determinist argument that biological sex predicts gender identity. Transgender people may or
may not have surgeries or hormone therapies to change their physical bodies, but in many cases they
experience a change in their social gender identities. Some people who do not identify as men or
women may identify as non-binary, gender fluid, or genderqueer, for example. Some may use
gender-neutral pronouns, such as ze/hir or they/them, rather than the gendered pronouns she/her or
he/his. As pronouns and gender identities are not visible on the body, trans communities have created
procedures for communicating gender pronouns, which consists of verbally asking and stating one’s
pronouns (Nordmarken, 2013).
The existence of sex variations fundamentally challenges the notion of a binary biological sex. Intersex
describes variation in sex characteristics, such as chromosomes, gonads, sex hormones, or genitals. The
bodies of individuals with sex characteristics variations do not fit typical definitions of what is culturally
considered “male” or “female.” “Intersex,” like “female” and “male,” is a socially constructed category
that humans have created to label bodies that they view as different from those they would classify as
distinctly “female” or “male.” The term basically marks existing biological variation among bodies;
bodies are not essentially intersex—we just call them intersex. The term is slightly misleading because
it may suggest that people have complete sets of what would be called “male” and “female”
reproductive systems, but those kinds of human bodies do not actually exist; “intersex” really just refers
to biological variation. The term “hermaphrodite” is therefore inappropriate for referring to intersex,
and it also is derogatory. There are a number of specific biological sex variations. For example, having
one Y and more than one X chromosome is called Kleinfelter Syndrome.
Does the presence of more than one X mean that the XXY person is female? Does the presence of a Y
51

Introduction to Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies

mean that the XXY person is male? These individuals are neither clearly chromosomally male or female;
they are chromosomally intersexed. Some people have genitalia that others consider ambiguous. This is
not as uncommon as you might think. The Intersex Society of North America estimated that some 1.5%
of people have sex variations—that is 2,000 births a year. So, why is this knowledge not commonly
known? Many individuals born with genitalia not easily classified as “male” or “female” are subject to
genital surgeries during infancy, childhood, and/or adulthood which aim to change this visible
ambiguity. Surgeons reduce the size of the genitals of female-assigned infants they want to make look
more typically “female” and less “masculine”; in infants with genital appendages smaller than 2.5
centimeters they reduce the size and assign them female (Dreger 1998). In each instance, surgeons
literally construct and reconstruct individuals’ bodies to fit into the dominant, binary sex/gender
system. While parents and doctors justify this practice as in “the best interest of the child,” many people
experience these surgeries and their social treatment as traumatic, as they are typically performed
without patients’ knowledge of their sex variation or consent. Individuals often discover their
chromosomal makeup, surgical records, and/or intersex status in their medical records as adults, after
years of physicians hiding this information from them. The surgeries do not necessarily make bodies
appear “natural,” due to scar tissue and at times, disfigurement and/or medical problems and chronic
infection. The surgeries can also result in psychological distress. In addition, many of these surgeries
involve sterilization, which can be understood as part of eugenics projects, which aim to eliminate
intersex people. Therefore, a great deal of shame, secrecy, and betrayal surround the surgeries.
Intersex activists began organizing in North America in the 1990s to stop these nonconsensual surgical
practices and to fight for patient-centered intersex health care. Broader international efforts emerged
next, and Europe has seen more success than the first wave of mobilizations. In 2008, Christiane Völling
of Germany was the first person in the world to successfully sue the surgeon who removed her internal
reproductive organs without her knowledge or consent (International Commission of Jurists, 2008). In
2015, Malta became the first country to implement a law to make these kinds of surgeries illegal and
protect people with sex variations as well as gender variations (Cabral & Eisfeld, 2015). Accord Alliance
is the most prominent intersex focused organization in the U.S.; they offer information and
recommendations to physicians and families, but they focus primarily on improving standards of care
rather than advocating for legal change. Due to the efforts of intersex activists, the practice of
performing surgeries on children is becoming less common in favor of waiting and allowing children to
make their own decisions about their bodies. However, there is little research on how regularly
nonconsensual surgeries are still performed in the U.S., and as Accord Alliance’s standards of care have
yet to be fully implemented by a single institution, we can expect that the surgeries are still being
performed.
The concepts of “transgender” and “intersex” are easy to confuse, but these terms refer to very
different identities. To review, transgender people experience a social process of gender change, while
intersex people have biological characteristics that do not fit with the dominant sex/gender system. One
term refers to social gender (transgender) and one term refers to biological sex (intersex). While
transgender people challenge our binary (man/woman) ideas of gender, intersex people challenge our
binary (male/female) ideas of biological sex. Gender theorists, such as Judith Butler and Gayle Rubin,
52

Introduction to Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies

have challenged the very notion that there is an underlying “sex” to a person, arguing that sex, too, is
socially constructed. This is revealed in different definitions of “sex” throughout history in law and
medicine—is sex composed of genitalia? Is it just genetic make-up? A combination of the two? Various
social institutions, such as courts, have not come to a consistent or conclusive way to define sex, and
the term “sex” has been differentially defined throughout the history of law in the United States. In this
way, we can understand the biological designations of “male” and “female” as social constructions that
reinforce the binary construction of men and women.

53

Introduction to Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies

Sexualities
As discussed in the section on social construction, heterosexuality is no more and no less natural than
gay sexuality or bisexuality, for instance. As was shown, people—particularly sexologists and medical
doctors—defined heterosexuality and its boundaries. This definition of the parameters of
heterosexuality is an expression of power that constructs what types of sexuality are considered
“normal” and which types of sexuality are considered “deviant.” Situated, cultural norms define what is
considered “natural.” Defining sexual desire and relations between women and men as acceptable and
normal means defining all sexual desire and expression outside that parameter as deviant. However,
even within sexual relations between men and women, gendered cultural norms associated with
heterosexuality dictate what is “normal” or “deviant.” As a quick thought exercise, think of some words
for women who have many sexual partners and then, do the same for men who have many sexual
partners; the results will be quite different. So, within the field of sexuality we can see power in
relations along lines of gender and sexual orientation (and race, class, age, and ability as well).
Adrienne Rich (1980) called heterosexuality “compulsory,” meaning that in our culture all people are
assumed to be heterosexual and society is full of both formal and informal enforcements that encourage
heterosexuality and penalize sexual variation. Compulsory heterosexuality plays an important role in
reproducing inequality in the lives of sexual minorities. Just look at laws; in a few states, such as
Indiana, joint adoptions are illegal for gay men and lesbians (Lambda Legal). Gay men and lesbians
have lost custody battles over children due to homophobia—the fear, hatred, or prejudice against gay
people (Pershing, 1994). Media depictions of gay men and lesbians are few and often negatively
stereotyped. There are few “out” gay athletes in the top three men’s professional sports—basketball,
baseball, and football—despite the fact that, statistically, there are very likely to be many (Zirin, 2010).
Many religious groups openly exclude and discriminate against gay men and lesbians. Additionally,
heteronormativity structures the everyday, taken-for-granted ways in which heterosexuality is
privileged and normalized. For instance, sociologist Karen Martin studied what parents say to their
children about sexuality and reproduction, and found that with children as young as three and five years
old, parents routinely assumed their children were heterosexual, told them they would get
(heterosexually) married, and interpreted cross-gender interactions between children as “signs” of
heterosexuality (Martin 2009). In this kind of socialization is an additional element of normative
sexuality—the idea of compulsory monogamy, where exclusive romantic and sexual relationships and
marriage are expected and valued over other kinds of relationships (Willey 2016). Therefore,
heteronormativity surrounds us at a very young age, teaching us that there are only two genders and
that we are or should desire and partner with one person of the opposite gender, who we will marry.
Just like gender, sexuality is neither binary nor fixed. There are straight people and gay people, but
people are also bisexual, pansexual, omnisexual, queer, and heteroflexible, to name a few additional
sexual identities. Also, sexual attraction, sexual relations and relationships, and sexual identity can shift
54

Introduction to Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies

over a person’s lifetime. As there are more than two genders,,there are more than two kinds of people
to be attracted to and individuals can be attracted to and can relate sexually to multiple people of
different genders at once!
Another common misconception is that not all transgender people are sexually queer. This belief may
stem from the “LGBT” acronym that lists transgender people along with lesbians, gay men, and
bisexuals. A trans man who previously identified as a lesbian may still be attracted to women and may
identify as straight, or may identify as queer. Another trans man may be attracted to other men and
identify as gay or queer. This multiplicity suggests that the culturally dominant binary model fails to
accurately encapsulate the wide variety of sexual and gender lived experiences.

55

Introduction to Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies

Masculinities
Another concept that troubles the gender binary is the idea of multiple masculinities (Connell, 2005).
Connell suggests that there is more than one kind of masculinity and what is considered “masculine”
differs by race, class, ethnicity, sexuality, and gender. For example, being knowledgeable about
computers might be understood as masculine because it can help a person accumulate income and
wealth, and we consider wealth to be masculine. However, computer knowledge only translates into
“masculinity” for certain men. While an Asian-American, middle-class man might get a boost in
“masculinity points” (as it were) for his high-paying job with computers, the same might not be true for
a working-class white man whose white-collar desk job may be seen as a weakness to his masculinity by
other working-class men. Expectations for masculinity differ by age; what it means to be a man at 19 is
very different than what it means to be a man at 70. Therefore, masculinity intersects with other
identities and expectations change accordingly.
Judith (Jack) Halberstam used the concept of female masculinity to describe the ways female-assigned
people may accomplish masculinity (2005). Halberstam defines masculinity as the connection between
maleness and power, which female-assigned people access through drag-king performances, butch
identity (where female-assigned people appear and act masculine and may or may not identify as
women), or trans identity. Separating masculinity from male-assigned bodies illustrates how
performative it is, such that masculinity is accomplished in interactions and not ordained by nature.

56

Introduction to Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies

Race
“Concepts of race did not exist prior to racism. Instead, it is inequality and oppression that have
produced the idea of essential racial differences” (Ferber, 2009: 176).
In the context of the United States, there is a binary understanding of race as either Black Here, we
capitalize Black and not white in recognition of Black as a reclaimed, and empowering, identity. or white. This is

not to say that only two races are recognized, just to say that these are the constructed “oppositional
poles” of race. What do we mean by race? What does Abby Ferber in the quote above mean by race?
More than just descriptive of skin color or physical attributes, in biologized constructions of race, race
determines intelligence, sexuality, strength, motivation, and “culture.” These ideas are not only held by
self-proclaimed racists, but are woven into the fabric of American society in social institutions. For
instance, prior to the 20th Century, people were considered to be legally “Black” if they had any African
ancestors. This was known as the one-drop rule, which held that if you had even one drop of African
“blood,” you would have been considered Black. The same did not apply to white “blood”—rather,
whiteness was defined by its purity. Even today, these ideas continue to exist. People with one Black
and one white parent (for instance, President Barack Obama) are considered Black, and someone with
one Asian parent and one white parent is usually considered Asian.
Many cultural ideas of racial difference were justified by the use of science. White scientists of the early
19th Century set out to “prove” Black racial inferiority by studying biological difference. Most notable
were studies that suggested African American skulls had a smaller cranial capacity, contained smaller
brains, and, thus, less intelligence. Later studies revealed both biased methodological practices by
scientists and findings that brain size did not actually predict intelligence. The practice of using science
in an attempt to support ideas of racial superiority and inferiority is known as scientific racism.

Traces of scientific racism are evident in more recent “studies” of Black Americans. These studies and
their applications often are often shaped by ideas about African Americans from the era of chattel
slavery in the Americas. For instance, the Moynihan Report, also known as “The Negro Family: A Case
for National Action” (1965) was an infamous document that claimed the non-nuclear family structure
found among poor and working-class African American populations, characterized by an absent father
and matriarchal mother, would hinder the entire race’s economic and social progress. While the actual
argument was much more nuanced, politicians picked up on this report to propose an essentialist
argument about race and the “culture of poverty.” They played upon stereotypes from the era of
African-American slavery that justified treating Black Americans as less than human. One of these
stereotypes is the assumption that Black men and women are hypersexual; these images have been best
analyzed by Patricia Hill Collins (2004) in her work on “controlling images” of African Americans—
images such as the “Jezebel” image of Black women and the “Buck” image of Black men discussed
earlier. Slave owners were financially invested in the reproduction of slave children since children born
58

Introduction to Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies

of mothers in bondage would also become the property of owners, so much so that they did not wait for
women to get pregnant of their own accord but institutionalized practices of rape against slave women
to get them pregnant (Collins, 2004). It was not a crime to rape a slave—and this kind of rape was not
seen as rape—since slaves were seen as property. But, since many people recognized African American
slaves as human beings, they had to be framed as fundamentally different in other ways to justify
enslavement. The notion that Black people are “naturally” more sexual and that Black women were
therefore “unrapable” (Collins 2004) served this purpose. Black men were framed as hypersexual
“Bucks” uninterested in monogamy and family; this idea justified splitting up slave families and using
Black men to impregnate Black women. The underlying perspectives in the Moynihan Report—that
Black families are composed of overbearing (in both senses of the word: over-birthing and overcontrolling) mothers and disinterested fathers and that if only they could form more stable nuclear
families and mirror the white middle-class they would be lifted from poverty—reflect assumptions of
natural difference found in the ideology supporting American slavery. The structural causes of
racialized economic inequality— particularly, the undue impoverishment of Blacks and the undue
enrichment of whites during slavery and decades of unequal laws and blocked access to employment
opportunities (Feagin 2006)—are ignored in this line of argument in order to claim fundamental
biological differences in the realms of gender, sexuality and family or racial “culture.” Furthermore, this
line of thinking disparages alternative family forms as dysfunctional rather than recognizing them as
adaptations that enabled survival in difficult and even intolerable conditions.
Of course, there are other racial groups recognized within the United States, but the Black/white binary
is the predominant racial binary system at play in the American context. We can see that this
Black/white binary exists and is socially constructed if we consider the case of the 19th Century Irish
immigrant. When they first arrived, Irish immigrants were “blackened” in the popular press and the
white, Anglo-Saxon imagination (Roediger 1991). Cartoon depictions of Irish immigrants gave them
dark skin and exaggerated facial features like big lips and pronounced brows. They were depicted and
thought to be lazy, ignorant, and alcoholic nonwhite “others” for decades.

“Ireland from One or Two Neglected Points of View (1899)” by H. Strickland Constable is in the Public Domain, CC0

An illustration from the H. Strickland Constable’s Ireland from One or Two Neglected Points of View shows an
alleged similarity between “Irish Iberian” and “Negro” features in contrast to the higher “Anglo-Teutonic.” The
accompanying caption reads:
“The Iberians are believed to have been originally an African race, who thousands of years ago spread themselves
through Spain over Western Europe. Their remains are found in the barrows, or burying places, in sundry parts of
these countries. The skulls are of low prognathous type. They came to Ireland and mixed with the natives of the
South and West, who themselves are supposed to have been of low type and descendants of savages of the Stone
Age, who, in consequence of isolation from the rest of the world, had never been out-competed in the healthy
struggle of life, and thus made way, according to the laws of nature, for superior races.”

Over time, Irish immigrants and their children and grandchildren assimilated into the category of
“white” by strategically distancing themselves from Black Americans and other non-whites in labor
disputes and participating in white supremacist racial practices and ideologies. In this way, the Irish in
America became white. A similar process took place for Italian-Americans, and, later, Jewish American
immigrants from multiple European countries after the Second World War. Similar to Irish Americans,
both groups became white after first being seen as non-white. These cases show how socially
constructed race is and how this labeling process still operates today. For instance, are AsianAmericans, considered the “model minority,” the next group to be integrated into the white category, or
will they continue to be regarded as foreign threats? Only time will tell.

Class
Socio-economic class differences are particularly hidden in the US context. Part of this can be explained
by the ideology of the American Dream. According to a popular belief in meritocracy, anyone who
works hard enough will succeed, and those who do not succeed must not have worked hard enough.
There is a logical error in this form of reasoning, which does not explain the following two scenarios:
What about people who do not work very hard at all and still succeed? What about those who work
exceptionally hard and never succeed? Part of this, of course, is about how we define success.
Succeeding at the American Dream means something akin to having a great job, making a lot of money,
and owning a car, a house, and all the most-recent gadgets. These are markers of material, that is,
economic, wealth. Wealth is not only captured in personal income, but other assets as well (house, car,
stocks, inheritances), not all of which are necessarily earned by hard work alone, but can come from
inheritance, marriage, or luck.
Though rich/poor may be the binary associated with class, most people in the US context (no matter
how much wealth they have) consider themselves “middle-class.” (Pew Research Center, 2010). The
label “middle-class” represents more than what people have in their bank accounts—it reflects a
political ideology. When politicians run for election or argue over legislation they often employ the term
“middle-class” to stand in for “average,” “tax-paying,” “morally upstanding” constituents and argue for
their collective voice and prosperity. Rhetorically, the “middle class” is not compared to the super rich
(since, in the US, you can never be too rich or too thin), but rather the poor. So, when people talk about
the middle class they are also often implying that they are NOT those “deviant,” “tax-swindling,”
“immoral,” poor people. This may seem harsh, but this is truly how the poor are represented in news
media (Mantsios, 2007). If this still seems far-fetched, just replace with phrase “the poor” with “welfare
recipients.” Welfare recipients are often faceless but framed as undeserving of assistance since they are
assumed to be cheating the system, addicted to alcohol or drugs, and have only themselves to blame for
their poverty (Mantsios, 2007). Welfare recipients are the implied counterparts to the middle-class
everymen that populate political speeches and radio rants. Thus, in the United States, socioeconomic
class has been constructed as a binary between the middle-class and the poor.
Furthermore, these class-based categories also carry racial and sexual meanings, as the “welfare
queen” stereotype conjures images of poor, black, sexually-promiscuous women, contrary to the fact
that white women as a group are the largest recipients of welfare. Fred Block and colleagues (2006)
discuss how these stereotypes about the poor are written into American poverty policies. For instance,
in 1996, President Bill Clinton passed the Personal Responsibility/Work Opportunities Reconciliation Act
(PRWORA), which fundamentally rewrote prior US welfare policy. This act limits lifetime receipt of
welfare to a maximum of 60 months, or 5 years, and requires that able-bodied recipients work or jobtrain for low-skill jobs while receiving checks. Under PRWORA, recent immigrants cannot receive
welfare for their first five years of legal residence, and undocumented immigrants can never receive
61

Introduction to Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies

welfare benefits (Block et al. 2006). These restrictions are based on the assumption that welfare
recipients are ultimately cheating the American taxpayer and looking for a free ride. In spite of these
changes, most people still believe that being on government assistance means a lifetime of free money.
Media contempt for welfare recipients is accomplished by not humanizing the experience of poverty.
People experiencing poverty can face tough choices; for instance, working more hours or getting a
slightly better paying job can cause one to fail the “means test” (an income level above which people
are ineligible for welfare benefits) for food stamps or Medicaid. The poor are increasingly forced to
decide between paying for rent versus food and other bills, as the cost of living has risen dramatically in
the past few decades while working-class wages have not risen comparably.

The SPENT game captures and humanizes this process of making tough decisions on a tight budget. Try it out
and see how you fare: http://playspent.org/.

However, class issues are not only about income differences. Cultural capital is a term coined by the
late sociologist Pierre Bourdieu (1984) to address non-monetary class differences such as tastes in food
and music or knowledge of high culture. Bourdieu explained that even when a formerly poor individual
experiences economic mobility and becomes middle-class, there are still markers of her former status in
the way she carries herself and the things she knows. We see many examples of this in popular films.
When someone goes from rags to riches, they often use the wrong utensils at a dinner party, call
something by the wrong name, cannot tell the difference between a Chardonnay and a Merlot (wines ),
or spend their money in a showy way. Thus, someone can have high cultural capital and not be wealthy,
or have low cultural capital and be a millionaire. For instance, in the popular (and very campy) movie
Showgirls (Verhoeven, 1995), the main character, Nomi Malone, goes from homeless and unemployed
to a well paid Las Vegas showgirl at record speed. Along the way, she buys an expensive Versace dress
and brags about it. Unfortunately, she reveals her lack of cultural capital, and thus her former status as
poor, by mispronouncing the brand (saying ‘Verse-ACE’ instead of ‘Vers-a-Chee’) and is humiliated by
some rather mean bystanders. In sum, the concept of cultural capital highlights the ways in which social
class is not just about wealth and income, but that social classes develop class cultures.

Alternatives to Binary Systems
Through all these examples, we hope to show that binary ways of understanding human differences are
insufficient for understanding the complexities of human culture. Binary ways of thinking assume that
there are only two categories of gender, race, and class identities among others, and that these two
categories are complete opposites. Just as men are defined as “not women” in a binary system, straight
people are defined as “not gay,” white people are defined as “not Black,” and middle-class people are
defined as “not poor.” Oppositional, binary thinking works strategically such that the dominant groups
in society are associated with more valued traits, while the subordinate groups, defined as their
opposites, are always associated with less valued traits. Thus, the poles in a binary system define each
other and only make sense in the presence of their opposites. Masculinity only has meaning as the
opposite of femininity. In reality, identities and lives are complex and multi-faceted. For one, all
categories of identity are more richly expressed and understood as matrices of difference. More than
that, all of us have multiple aspects of identity that we experience simultaneously and that are mutually
constitutive. Our experience of gender is always shaped by our race, class, and other identities. Our
experience of race is particular to our gender, class, and other identities as well. This is why taking an
intersectional approach to understanding identity gives us a more complex understanding of social
reality. Each of our social locations is impacted by the intersection of several facets of identity in a way
that should give us pause when we encounter blanket statements like “all men are ______” or “all
Latinas are _____” or “all lesbians are____.” The social world is complex, and rather than reducing
human difference to simple binaries, we must embrace the world as it is and acknowledge the
complexity.

UNIT III: INSTITUTIONS, CULTURE,
AND STRUCTURES

Introduction: Institutions, Cultures,
and Structures
Thus far, we have been concerned with feminist theories and perspectives that seek to understand how
difference is constructed through structures of power, how inequalities are produced and reproduced
through socially constructed binaries, and how the categories of race, class, gender, and sexuality
intersect. At this juncture, we can ask: where do these processes occur? How do they not only get
produced, but how are they re-produced through daily activities in institutions? In the following section,
we identify, historicize, and analyze several of the key institutions that structure our lives, including the
family, media, medicine, law and the prison system. We use the struggle to end violence against women
as a case to show how multiple institutions intersect and overlap in ways that both limit and enable
action. First, we provide a theoretical overview of institutions, culture, and structures.
To answer these questions we need to look at the institutions within which we spend a large part of our
lives interacting with others. An institution is a “social order or pattern that has attained a certain
state or property…and [owes] [its] survival to relatively self-activating social processes” (Jepperson
1991: 145). In other words, institutions are enduring, historical facets of social life that shape our
behavior. Examples of institutions include the family, marriage, media, medicine, law, education, the
state, and work. These institutions can be said to structure thought and behavior, in that they prescribe
rules for interaction and inclusion/exclusion and norms for behavior, parcel out resources between
groups, and often times rely on formal regulations (including laws, policies, and contracts). In almost
every facet of our day-to-day experience we operate within institutions—often within multiple
institutions at once—without noticing their influence on our lives. As a result, we can conceive of
institutions—primarily the family, schools, religious institutions, media, and peer groups—as primary
agents of socialization (Kimmel 2007). These are primary agents of socialization in that we are born into
them, shaped by their expectations, norms, and rules, and as we grow older we often operate in the
same institutions and teach these expectations, norms, and rules to younger generations.

Institutions are primary sites for the reproduction of gendered, classed, racialized, ableized, and
sexualized inequalities. Everyone does not have access to the same institutions—the same schools, the
same hospitals, marriage, etc.,—because often times these institutions differentiate between and
differentially reward people based on categories of gender, class, race, ability, and sexuality. For
example, think of the city or town you grew up in. There may have been different schools located in
different areas of the city, in neighborhoods that differed in the class and race composition of the
people living in those neighborhoods. Perhaps there was a school located in a predominantly white,
middle-class neighborhood and another school located in a neighborhood of predominantly workingclass people of color. Perhaps there were also private schools that required high tuition rates. Due to
the fact that schools in most states are funded based on the tax base of the school district they are in,
schools located in different neighborhoods will have different amounts of resources—books, computers,
the ability to pay teachers and staff, etc. Those students who live in the middle-class school district will
benefit from a well-funded public school, while students who live in the working-class school district will
be disadvantaged from the lower amount of funding of their school district. Meanwhile, students who
attend the prestigious private school will most likely already be economically privileged and will further
benefit from a well-funded school that surrounds them with students with similar class backgrounds
69

Introduction to Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies

and expectations. These students will most likely benefit from a curriculum of college preparatory
classes, while students in public schools are less likely to be enrolled in college prep classes—limiting
their ability to get into college. Therefore, the same race and class inequalities that limited access to the
middle-class, predominantly white neighborhood school will give those privileged students greater
chances to enter college and maintain their privileged status. In this way, race and class privileges (and
disadvantages) get reproduced through institutions.

Institutions shape, and are shaped by, culture. Culture is a system of symbols, values, practices, and
interests of a group of people.In this definition we are combining Kirk and Okazawa-Rey’s (2004) definition of
culture with Sewell’s (1992) definition of culture. Culture is shot through with ideology, which can be

understood to be the ideas, attitudes, and values of the dominant culture. It is important to note that
“dominant culture” does not describe the most numerous group within society. “Dominant culture”
typically describes a relatively small social group that has a disproportionate amount of power. An
example of a dominant culture would be the numerically small white minority in South Africa during
apartheid. More recently, the Occupy Movement has critiqued the ways in which the “1%” exerts a
disproportionate amount of control and power as the dominant culture in the United States.

Mainstream institutions often privilege and reward the dominant culture. The sociologist Pierre
Bourdieu (1984) argues that institutions value certain types of culture and reward people who have
those types of culture. As we discussed in the previous chapter, different social classes have different
types of cultural capital—assets that are not necessarily economic, but promote social mobility. For
example, students who attend public schools in middle-class districts or private schools often have
access to more language courses, arts courses, and extracurricular activities—skills, knowledge, and
experiences that colleges value greatly in their admission decisions. Schools in less economically
privileged districts often have fewer of these options.
In this way, culture is not an even playing field, and not everyone has equal access to defining what
71

Introduction to Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies

types of symbols, meanings, values, and practices are valued by institutions. Those groups of people
with greater access to mainstream institutions—those who have been born into wealth, white, men,
able-bodied, heterosexual—have a greater ability to define what types of culture will be valued by
institutions, and often have access to the cultural capital that mainstream institutions value.
The interaction between culture and institutions creates social structures. Social structures are
composed of 1) socially constructed ideas, principles, and categories and 2) institutions that distribute
material resources to stratified groups based on socially constructed ideas, principles, and categories.
Additionally, 3) they shape—or structure—experience, identity, and practice. Social structures are
relational, in that they function to stratify groups based on the categories that underlie those
groups—allocating both symbolic and material benefits and resources unequally among those groups.
“Symbolic resources” are the nonmaterial rewards that accrue to privileged groups. An example would
be the way in which employers often assume that employees who are fathers are more responsible,
mature, and hardworking, and deserve more pay as opposed to their childless peers or to working
mothers (Hodges and Budig 2010). In this example, the sex/gender/sexuality system is a structure
through which employers—as gatekeepers of advancement through institutions of work—privilege
heterosexual fatherhood. The effect of this is the reproduction of the symbolic privileging of
heterosexual masculinity, and the unequal allocation of material resources (salary and wage raises,
advancement opportunities) to married men with children. Unmarried men without children do not
receive the same symbolic and material rewards nor do married women with children. In this sense,
structures limit access to opportunities: educational opportunities, employment opportunities, and
opportunities to move up in social class standing.
While there may be a tendency to think of “structures” as unchangeable and monolithic entities, our
definition of structure does not make such an assumption. In our definition, social structures are made
possible by their reliance on socially constructed categories—that is, categories that change through
time and place. Furthermore, while social structures can be said to structure experience and identity,
people are not passive observers or dupes—as the history of labor struggles, struggles for selfdetermination in former colonies, the civil rights movement, and feminist movements have shown,
people fight back against the institutions and dominant cultural ideas and categories that have been
used to oppress them. Even though socially constructed categories have typically been used to stratify
groups of people, those same groups of people may base an activist struggle out of that identity,
transforming the very meanings of that identity in the process. For instance, the phrases “Black power”
and “gay power” were created by Black and gay liberationists in the late 1960s to claim and re-frame
identities that had been disparaged by the dominant culture and various mainstream institutions. This
history of resistance within the crux of overarching structures of power shows that people have agency
to make choices and take action. In other words, while structures limit opportunities and reproduce
inequalities, groups of people who have been systemically denied access to mainstream institutions can
and have exerted their will to change those institutions. Therefore, structure and agency should not be
viewed as two diametrically opposed forces, but as two constantly interacting forces that shape each
other.

The Family
There is a multiplicity of family forms in the United States and throughout the world. When we try to
define the word “family” we realize just how slippery of a concept it is. Does family mean those who are
blood related? This definition of family excludes stepparents and adopted children from a definition of
those in one’s family. It also denies the existence of fictive kin, or non-blood related people that one
considers to be part of one’s family. Does family mean a nuclear family (composed of legally-married
parents and their children ), as it so often is thought to in the contemporary United States? This
excludes extended kin—or family members such as uncles, aunts, grandparents, cousins, nephews, and
nieces. It also excludes single parents, the unmarried, and those couples who do not have children. Or
does family denote a common household characterized by economic cooperation? This definition would
exclude those who consider each other family but cannot or do not live in the same household, often
times for economic reasons—for example, South or Central American parents leaving their country of
origin to make wages in the United States and send them back to their families—or because of
incarceration.

“An estimated 809,800 prisoners of the 1,518,535 held in the nation’s prisons at midyear 2007 were parents of
children under age 18. Parents held in the nation’s prisons — 52 percent of state inmates and 63 percent of federal
inmates — reported having an estimated 1,706,600 minor children, accounting for 2.3 percent of the U.S. resident
population under age 18.” (Sabol and West 2010)

All of these definitions would also deny the importance and existence of what Kath Weston (1991) has
labeled “chosen families,” or how queers, gay men, and lesbians who are ostracized from their
families of origin form kinship ties with close friends. The diversity of family formations across time and
place suggests that the definition of a “…universal ‘family’ hides historical change as it sets in place or
reproduces an ideology of ‘the family’ that obscures the diversity and reality of family experience in any
place and time” (Gerstel 2003: 231). What is the dominant ideology of “family” in the United States?
How did the family formation that this dominant ideology rests upon come to be the normative model of
“family?”

74

Introduction to Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies

“Family Ideal” by bykst is in the Public Domain, CC0

The dominant ideology of what constitutes a “family” in the United States recognizes a very class- and
race-specific type of gendered family formation. This family formation has been labeled the Standard
North American Family (SNAF) (Smith 1993). Smith (1993) defines the SNAF as:

…a conception of the family as a legally married couple sharing a household. The adult male is
in paid employment; his earnings provide the economic basis of the family-household. The adult
female may also earn an income, but her primary responsibility is to the care of the husband,
household, and children. Adult male and female may be parents (in whatever legal sense) of
children also resident in the household (Smith 1993: 52).
It is important to note that the majority of families in the United States do not fit this ideological family
formation. Judith Stacey (1998) calls these multiple and numerous differences in the ways in which
people structure their families, post-modern families.
When we put the SNAF into a historical perspective, we are able to see how this dominant family
formation is neither natural nor outside of politics and processes of race, class, and gender inequality.
Historians Nancy Cott (2000) and Stephanie Coontz (2005) have written about the history of the SNAF.
The SNAF originated in the 19th century with the separation between work and family, which was
occasioned by the rise of industrial capitalism. Previous to an industrial economy based on the creation
75

Introduction to Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies

of commodities in urban factories, the family was primarily an agricultural work unit—there was no
separation between work and home. With the rise of industrial capitalism, in working class families and
families of color (who had been denied access to union jobs or were still enslaved, maintaining their
poverty or working-class status) the majority of family members—including children and
women—worked in factories.
Middle-class families who had inherited property and wealth—the vast majority of whom were
white—did not need all the members of their families to work. They were able to pay for their homes,
hire house servants, maids (who were primarily African American, working-class women) and tutors,
and send their children to private educational institutions with the salary of the breadwinning father.
Thus, the gendered division of labor—wherein women perform unpaid care-work within the home and
men are salaried or wage-earning breadwinners—that is often assumed to be a natural, given way of
family life originated due to relatively recent economic changes that privileged middle-class, white
families.
This false split between the publicly-oriented, working father and the privately-oriented domestic
mother produced the ideologies of separate spheres and the cult of domesticity. The ideology of
separate spheres held that women and men were distinctly different creatures, with different natures
and therefore suited for different activities. Masculinity was equated with breadwinning, and femininity
was equated with homemaking.

This work by ArtsyBee is in the Public Domain, CC0

Correspondingly, the cult of domesticity was an ideology about white womanhood that held that white
women were asexual, pure, moral beings properly located in the private sphere of the household.
Importantly, this ideology was applied to all women as a measure of womanhood. The effects of this
ideology were to systematically deny working-class white women and women of color access to the
76

Introduction to Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies

category of “women,” because these women had to work and earn wages to support their families.
Furthermore, during this period, coverture laws defined white women who were married to be legally
defined as the property of their husband. Upon marriage, women’s legal personhood was dissolved into
that of the husband. They could not own property, sign or make legal documents, and any wages they
made had to be turned over to their husbands. Thus, even though they did not have to work in factories
or the fields of plantations, white middle-class women were systematically denied rights and
personhood under coverture. In this way, white middle-class women had a degree of material wealth
and symbolic status as pure, moral beings, but at the cost of submission to their husbands and lack of
legal personhood. White working-class women and women of color had access to the public sphere in
ways white middle-class women did not, but they also had to work in poorly paid jobs and were thought
to be less than true women because of this.
The historical, dominant ideology of the SNAF is reinforced by present day law and social policy. For
example, when gay men and lesbians have children they often rely on adoption or assisted reproductive
technologies, including in vitro fertilization or surrogacy (where a woman is contracted to carry a child
to term for someone else), among other methods. Since laws in most states assume that blood-ties
between mother and child supersede non-biological family relations, gay men and lesbians who seek to
have children and families face barriers to this. The conventional assumptions of the SNAF are
embodied in law, and in this case, do not match with the realities of groups of people who depart from
the ideology of the SNAF.
Social policies often assume that the SNAF is not only a superior family structure, but that its
promotion is a substitute for policies that would seek to reduce poverty. For instance, both the
administrations of George W. Bush and Barack Obama have promoted marriage and the nuclear family
as poverty reduction policy. These programs have targeted poor families of color, in particular. In The
Healthy Marriages Initiative of 2004, President Bush pledged $1.5 billion to programs aimed at
“Marriage education, marriage skills training, public advertising campaigns, high school education on
the value of marriage and marriage mentoring programs…activities promoting fatherhood, such as
counseling, mentoring, marriage education, enhancing relationship skills, parenting, and activities to
foster economic stability” (US Department of Health and Human Services 2009). Such policies ignore
the historical, structural sources of racialized poverty and blame the victims of systemic classism and
racism. As the history of the SNAF shows, the normative family model is based on a white middle-class
model—one that a majority of families in the US do not fit or necessarily want to fit.

Media
Take a minute to think about how much media you are exposed to in one day—from watching television
and movies, to cruising the Internet, reading newspapers, books, and magazines, listening to music and
watching music videos, or playing video games. The majority of this media is produced by corporations,
and infused with advertisements.
According to a Nielson Company—a marketing corporation that collects statistics on media
usage—report, the average American “18-34 spent two hours and 45 minutes daily watching live TV in
the 4th Quarter of 2015, and one hour and 23 minutes using TV-connected devices—a total of four hours
and 8 minutes using a TV set for any purpose” (Nielson Company, 201). The pervasiveness of media in
culture begs a number of questions: what are the effects of such an overwhelming amount of exposure
to media that is often saturated with advertisements? How do media construct or perpetuate gendered,
sexualized, classed, ableized, and racialized differences and inequalities? What is the relationship
between media and consumers, and how do consumers interact with media?
Media expert and sociologist Michael Kimmel (2003) argues that the media are a primary institution of
socialization that not only reflects, but creates culture. Media representation is a key domain for
identity formation and the creation of gendered and sexualized difference. For example, think back to
Disney movies you were probably shown as a child. The plots of these movies typically feature a
dominant young man—a prince, a colonial ship captain, a soldier—who is romantically interested in a
young woman—both are always assumed to be heterosexual—who at first resists the advances of the
young man, but eventually falls in love with him and marries him. These Disney movies teach children a
great deal about gender and sexuality; specifically, they teach children to value hegemonic
masculinity and emphasized femininity. Hegemonic masculinity refers to a specific type of
culturally-valued masculinity tied to marriage and heterosexuality and patriarchal authority in the
family and workplace, and maintains its privileged position through subordinating other less dominant
forms of masculinity (i.e., dominance over men of lower socioeconomic classes or gay men). Emphasized
femininity, meanwhile, refers to a compliance with the normative ideal of femininity, as it is oriented to
serving the interests of men (Connell 1987).
What do Disney movies have to do with how people actually live their lives? It is because they are
fictional and do not have to be verified by reality, and they are so pervasive in our culture and shown to
us at such a young age that they may shape our gendered and sexualized selves in ways that we do not
even realize. How many times have you heard people say that they want a “fairy tale wedding,” or heard
the media refer to a celebrity wedding as a “fairy tale wedding?” This is one example of how media
reproduces dominant ideologies—the ideas, attitudes, and values of the dominant culture—about gender
and sexuality.

78

Introduction to Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies

Media also reproduce racialized and gendered normative standards in the form of beauty ideals for
both women and men. As Jean Kilbourne’s video series Killing Us Softly illustrates, representations of
women in advertising, film, and magazines often rely on the objectification of women—cutting apart
their bodies with the camera frame and re-crafting their bodies through digital manipulation in order to
create feminized bodies with characteristics that are largely unattainable by the majority of the
population. Kilbourne shows how advertising often values the body types and features of white
women—having petite figures and European facial features—while often exoticizing women of color by
putting them in “nature” scenes and animal-print clothing that are intended to recall a pre-civilizational
past. The effect of this is to cast women of color as animalistic, savage creatures—a practice that has
historically been used in political cartoons and depictions of people of color to legitimate their
subjugation as less than human. In addition, media depict the world from a masculine point of view,
representing women as sex objects. This kind of framing, what Laura Mulvey called the male gaze,
encourages men viewers to see women as objects and encourages women to see themselves as objects
of men’s desire; the male gaze is thus a heterosexual male gaze. These are just a couple of examples of
how media simultaneously reflect and construct differences in power between social groups in society
through representing those groups.
Another way in which media reflect and simultaneously produce power differences between social
groups is through symbolic annihilation. Symbolic annihilation refers to how social groups that lack
power in society are rendered absent, condemned, or trivialized through mass media representations
that simultaneously reinforce dominant ideologies and the privilege of dominant groups. For example,
as we argued earlier, gay and lesbian, as well as transgender and disabled characters in mass media are
often few and when they are present they are typically stereotyped and misrepresented. Trans women
characters portrayed through the cisgender heterosexual male gaze are often used as plot twists or
objects of ridicule for comedic effect, and are often represented as “actually men” who deceive men in
order to “trap” them into having sex with them; these representations function to justify and normalize
portrayals of disgust in response to them and violence against them. These kinds of portrayals of trans
women as “evil deceivers” and “pretenders” have been used in court cases to pardon perpetrators who
have murdered trans women (Bettcher 2007).

While Jean Kilbourne’s insights illustrate how beauty ideals produce damaging effects on women and
girls, her model of how consumers relate to media constructs media consumers as passively accepting
everything they see in advertising and electronic and print media. As Michael Kimmel (2003) argues,
“The question is never whether or not the media do such and such, but rather how the media and its
consumers interact to create the varying meanings that derive from our interactions with those media”
(Kimmel 2003: 238). No advertisement, movie, or any form of media has an inherent, intended meaning
that passes directly from the producer of that media to the consumer of it, but consumers interact with,
critique, and sometimes reject the intended messages of media. In this way, the meanings of media
develop through the interaction between the media product and the consumers who are interacting
with it. Furthermore, media consumers can blur the distinction between producer and consumer
80

Introduction to Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies

through creating their own media in the form of videos, music, pamphlets, ‘zines, and other forms of
cultural production. Therefore, while media certainly often reproduce dominant ideologies and
normative standards, media consumers from different standpoints can and do modify and reject the
intended meanings of media.

Medicine, Health, and Reproductive
Justice
We often think of medicine and medical knowledge as objective, neutral, and vitally important to our
well being the well being of and society. There is no doubt that medicine has produced life-saving
technologies, treatments, and vaccines. However, medicine is not a neutral field that exists independent
of the cultures and societies within which it is created. Medicine relies on the medical model, which
contains a number of assumptions. First, it assumes that the body is governed by laws and processes
independent of culture, social life and institutions. Second, it assumes that physicians are those
qualified to evaluate and define the body’s health or pathology and treat it as they see necessary. In
sum, the medical model is a medical-biological understanding of the body, which constructs the
systems, pathologies, or indicators of health of the body as independent of culture, ideology, economy,
and the state. Feminist and critical theorists have critiqued this understanding of the body, showing
both how doctors and medicine medicalize bodies in particular ways according to gender ideologies.
Furthermore, feminists have argued that we need to pay attention to how race, gender, and class
inequalities shape the health outcomes of differently situated groups in society.
Medical sociologist Peter Conrad (2007) defines medicalization as the process whereby human
problems “become defined and treated as medical problems, usually in terms of illness and disorders”
which are then managed and treated by health professionals. Medicalization constructs medical
problems, which are codified in policy by governing bodies, such as the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in the US, that recommend treatment. For example, two different diagnostic categories for
the experience of low sexual desire—one for men (Male Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder), and one for
women (Female Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder)—newly appeared in the most recent edition of the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association,
2013). Low sexual desire does not threaten a person’s health, but these categories treat low sexual
desire as a problem and construct the experience as essentially distinct for women than for men. A
number of the members of the work groups that created diagnostic categories in the DSM-5 had
conflicting interests, such as ties to pharmaceutical companies (Welch et al., 2013). This diagnostic
category followed the development and marketing of the first product to treat “female sexual
dysfunction”—called EROS—by Urometrics, a pharmaceutical company. The Food and Drug
Administration defines “female sexual dysfunction” as “decreased sexual desire, decreased sexual
arousal, pain during intercourse, or inability to climax” (Shah 2003). This pathologization of decreased
sexual arousal emerged in a specific social context in which Pfizer’s $1.3 billion profit windfall from
Viagra in 2000 spurred pharmaceutical companies to develop an equivalent product to market to
women, and a diagnostic category emerged next to encourage prescriptions and sales of the drug.

In this example, heterosexual women’s sexuality becomes medicalized to serve various interests other
than their own health and pleasure. Feminists have been critiquing the ways in which women’s sexual
needs and desires are often subordinated to men’s sexual needs and desires for decades—diagnosing
the problem as stemming from exhaustion from both paid work and unpaid housework, as well as
inattentive male partners. Urometrics and the doctors who developed EROS, in contrast, diagnose the
problem as stemming from female bodily dysfunction. Instead of addressing the deeper social and
cultural reasons for why heterosexual women may not be fulfilled sexually, EROS offers a commodified,
FDA-approved, medically indicated treatment for a medically-defined “bodily dysfunction.” Relatedly,
gender nonconformity transgender identity has been medicalized for the past several decades. The
current diagnostic category in the DSM-5 is called “Gender Dysphoria.”
Medicalization is an aspect of bio-power. Bio-power, according to philosopher Michel Foucault (1979)
refers to the practices of modern states to regulate their subjects through technologies of power.
Foucault argued that in complex modern societies populations will not tolerate totalitarian uses of state
power. Therefore, modern states must find less overt ways to control their populations, such as
collecting data on the health, reproductive capacities, and sexual behaviors of their populations for the
purpose of state regulation and intervention. For example, historian Laura Briggs shows how in the
United States colonial occupation of Puerto Rico in the early 20th century, public health officials treated
the problem of venereal disease as a problem of overpopulation and sexual immorality, and sought to
83

Introduction to Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies

institute eugenics policies (discussed below) to limit Puerto Rican women’s ability to reproduce.
Importantly, Foucault argued that medical knowledge, combined with modern states’ collection of data
on their populations, created new norms of health which populations internalize. Thus, the intended
effect of bio-power is that people regulate themselves according to norms proliferated by medical
knowledge and the state.
As we have argued before, not all women’s health and sexuality has been medicalized in the same ways,
or with the same effects. Class and race differences and inequalities have made poor or working-class
white women and women of color, along with people with disabilities, the targets of public health
campaigns to regulate their sexuality and reproduction. Such was the case with the example of the
United States’ use of bio-power in Puerto Rico above. In that example, working-class and poor Puerto
Rican women’s sexuality and reproduction became medicalized in ways that wealthy Puerto Ricans’ and
white women’s sexuality and reproduction were not.
The eugenics movement began in the late 19th century, but has had far-reaching impacts around the
world. Eugenics is a medical/scientific ideology and social movement that takes the root of social and
psychological problems (poverty, mental illness, etc.) to be the genetic make-up or heredity of specific
groups within the population, and as a result, seeks to eliminate those groups through sterilization or
genocide. Eugenics takes biological determinism and bio-power to their furthest logical conclusions.
Eugenicists believe that selective breeding of those groups that they construct as “inherently
superior”—nondisabled, heterosexual, white, middle-class, Northern and Western Europeans—is a
rational-scientific answer to “solve” social problems. The most obvious and well-known example of
eugenics in practice is the Holocaust in Nazi Germany, but what many people do not know is that
eugenics-based sterilization was enforced by law in the United States for much of the 20th Century. In
1907, the world’s first first eugenics-based compulsory sterilization law was passed in Indiana, followed
by 30 states soon after (Lombardo, 2011). The Nazi government widely cited a report that praised the
results of sterilization in California as evidence that extensive sterilization programs are feasible and
humane (Miller, 2009). Between 1907 and 1963, over 64,000 individuals were forcibly sterilized under
eugenic legislation in the United States (Lombardo, 2011). The eugenics movement also took shape in
immigration policies in the United States into the first half of the 20th Century (Allen, 1996). Eugenics
projects are still in effect today. Sterilization is still coerced or forced on women and girls, and
especially disabled women and girls, in a number of countries (Guterman, 2011). Women in California
prisons have continued to be forcibly sterilized, as recently as 2010 (Campos, 2013). In addition, as of
April 2017, 20 countries in Europe require sterilization in order for trans people to obtain legal gender
recognition (Transgender Europe, 2017).
In addition to overt genocidal projects, social relations within conditions of inequality increasingly
expose stigmatized groups to environmental and health hazards at rates higher than privileged groups,
affecting birth and health outcomes. For example, according to the National Association of City and
County Health Officials, in the United States, the wealthier a person is, the lower their risk of disease,
cancer, infant death, and diabetes (NACCHO, 2008). However, two physicians who study premature
84

Introduction to Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies

birth—Richard David and James Collins—found that African Americans who were middle-class or upperclass did not experience the same lower risks for premature birth as their white peers. They attempted
to find out if there was a “premature birth gene” specific to African Americans, through comparing
newborns among African American women, white women, and African women. They found that African
women and white American women had similar pregnancy outcomes, but African American women
were still 3 times more likely to have premature births than both these groups—suggesting that there is
no genetic basis for difference between pregnancy outcomes for white and black women. Therefore,
David and Collins explain the pregnancy gap by arguing that African Americans, regardless of social
class, experience significant amounts of stress due to their daily experiences with racism in the United
States. For African Americans—particularly African American women—who are middle-class or upperclass, the necessity of being on the ball constantly and performing at the highest caliber at all times, in
order to refute racist stereotypes, results in a continuous, accumulating amount of stress which
translates into higher risk for negative health outcomes (Unnatural Causes, 2008). Such findings
suggest that intersecting race, class, and gender inequalities have real impacts on the health outcomes
of differently situated groups in society.
Recognition of the effects of social inequalities on women’s health motivates the activism of the
reproductive justice movement . A reproductive justice framework for understanding the politics of
health and reproduction highlights race, class, and gender inequalities and how these inequalities
constrain the abilities of women to control their lives. It centers the necessary social and cultural
conditions for poor women and women of color to be able to make choices, including equal wages for
equal work, employment, affordable housing, healthcare, and lives free from violence. The reproductive
justice movement was born out of the tensions between white, middle-class feminist activists and
women of color activists in feminist movements. White, middle-class feminist activists framed their
argument for abortion under a reproductive rights framework that relied on a language of
“choice,”—an individualizing way of talking about reproductive politics that overlooked the ways that
poverty, race, laws and medical authorities imposed control over many women’s reproductive lives.
Following the passage of Roe v. Wade in 1973 (the Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion),
the burgeoning conservative movement of the mid to late 1970s succeeded in getting the Hyde
Amendment passed. The Hyde Amendment prohibits federal funds—specifically Medicaid—from being
used to fund abortions. This Amendment disproportionately affects poor women, who are
disproportionately women of color. One would think that the National Organization of Women (NOW)
would have rallied to block or reverse the Hyde Amendment, but they did not. This led women of color
activists to critique the reproductive rights framework, arguing that this framework reflects the
interests and experiences of white, middle-class feminists and ignores the broader racial and class
inequalities that limit the abilities of women to actually make choices about reproduction and family.
The reproductive justice movement challenges the individualizing and depoliticizing tendencies of the
medicalization of women’s bodies by arguing that social inequalities limit choice and expose differently
situated female-bodied people to illness and disease depending on their social location within multiple
85

Introduction to Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies

axes of identity. As such, it shows how health and illness are deeply social and not solely determined by
biology or genetics.

Introduction to Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies

The State, Law, and the Prison System
In high school civics and social science classes, students are often taught that the United States is a
democratic nation-state because the government is composed of three separate branches—the
Executive, the Judicial, and Legislative branches—that work to check and balance each other. Students
are told that anyone can run for office and that people’s votes determine the direction of the nation.
However, as economist Joseph Stiglitz (2011) points out, the fact that the majority of US senators,
representatives in the House of Representatives, and Executive-branch policy makers originate from the
wealthiest 1% of the society should give one pause to rethink this conventional narrative.
We take a more critical view of the state than that of high school civics textbooks. We understand the
State to be an array of legislation, policies, governmental bodies, and military- and prison-industrial
complexes. We also observe that the line between civil society and the state is more fluid than
solid—citizens and groups of citizens often take extra-judicial actions that bolster the power of the state,
even if they are not officially agents of the state. This definition offers a more expansive understanding
of the ways in which government, civil society, and the global economy function together in ways that
often reflect the interests of domestic and global elites and international corporations. In the following
pages, we highlight ways that the state—in its various dimensions—plays a central role in maintaining
and reproducing inequalities.

State power is powerfully illustrated by Neighborhood Watch Groups and the killing of Trayvon Martin.
Additionally, lynchings of Black Americans serve as potent examples of citizens exercising racialized violence to
bolster racial segregation.

The state plays a significant role in reinforcing gender stratification and racism through legislation and
policies that influence numerous institutions, including education, social welfare programming, health
and medicine, and the family. A primary example of this is the prison system and the “War on Drugs”
begun in the 1980s by the Reagan Administration. According to Bureau of Justice Statistics, there were
over 2.1 million people incarcerated in the United States at the end of 2015 (Kaeble and Glaze, 2016).
Furthermore, over 6.7 million were either on probation, on parole, or in jail or prison. This means that
roughly 2.7% of the adult population of the United States was somehow under surveillance by the US
criminal justice system. Indeed, the United States has the highest number of people incarcerated than
any other country on the face of the globe. These rates of incarceration are largely the result of the
“War on Drugs,” which criminalized drug use and distribution.
A significant aspect of the “War on Drugs” was the establishment of mandatory minimum sentencing

87

Introduction to Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies

laws that send non-violent drug offenders to prison, rather than enrolling them in treatment programs.
The “War on Drugs” has disproportionately targeted people of color. Seventy percent of inmates in the
United States are non-white—a figure that surpasses the percentage of non-whites in US society, which
is approximately 23%, according to the 2015 US census. That means that non-white prisoners are far
over-represented in the US criminal justice system. While the incarceration of women, in general, for
drug-related offenses has skyrocketed 888% between 1986 and 1999, women of color have been
arrested at rates far higher than white women, even though they use drugs at a rate equal to or lower
than white women (ACLU 2004). Furthermore, according to Bureau of Justice statistics from 2007,
nearly two-thirds of US women prisoners had children under 18 years of age (Glaze and Maruschak,
2010). Before incarceration, disproportionately, these women were the primary caregivers to their
children and other family members. Thus, the impact on children, families, and communities is
substantial when women are imprisoned. Finally, inmates often engage in prison labor for less than
minimum wage. Corporations contract prison labor that produces millions of dollars in profit. Therefore,
the incarceration of millions of people artificially deflates the unemployment rate (something politicians
benefit from) and creates a cheap labor force that generates millions of dollars in profit for private
corporations. How do we make sense of this? What does this say about the state of democracy in the
United States?

Feminist activist and academic Angela Davis argues that we can conceptualize the prison system and its
linkages to corporate production as the prison-industrial complex. In the book Are Prisons
Obsolete?, Davis (2003) argues that more and more prisons were built in the 1980s in order to
concentrate and manage those marked as “human surplus” by the capitalist system. She sees a
historical connection between the system of slavery, and the enslavement of African Americans until
the 19th century, and the creation of a prison-industrial complex that not only attempts to criminalize
and manage Black, Latino, Native American, and poor bodies, but also attempts to extract profit from
them (through prison labor that creates profit for corporations). Thus, the prison-industrial complex is a
largely unseen (quite literally: most prisons are located in isolated areas) mechanism through which
people of color are marginalized in US society. Similarly, in The New Jim Crow, Michelle Alexander
(2010) argues that mass incarceration has created and maintains a “racial caste system.” She
emphasizes how mass incarceration debilitates individuals and communities through stigma, job
discrimination, and the loss of ability to vote in many states. Similarly, sociologist Loic Waquant (2010)
argues that mass incarceration within the criminal justice system functions as an increasingly powerful
system of racial control.
In light of the prison-industrial system and its racialized and gendered effects, how far has the US really
come in terms of racial and gender equality? Here, we point to the difference between de jure laws
and de facto realities. De jure refer to existing laws and de facto refers to on-the-ground realities.
While the Civil Rights Act of 1964 legally required an end to de jure segregation, or segregation
enforcible by law, in education, voting, and the workplace, de facto racial inequality still exists. We can
see clearly, just looking at incarceration statistics, that even though explicit racial discrimination is
89

Introduction to Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies

illegal, state policies such as the War on Drugs still have the effect of disproportionately imprisoning
people of color.

Intersecting Institutions Case Study:
The Struggle to End Gendered
Violence and Violence Against Women
Thus far we have illustrated some ways in which social institutions overlap with and reinforce one
another. In this section, we use the case of the struggle to end violence against women as an example of
the ways in which the family, media, medicine, and law and the prison system facilitate gendered
violence and violence against women. The term gendered violence highlights not only the manner in
which transgender people, gay men, and women often experience violence, but also how violence takes
place more broadly within the context of a society that is characterized by a sex/gender/sexuality
system that disparages femininity, sexual minorities, and gender minorities. Hussein Balhan’s (1985)
definition of violence emphasizes the structural and systematic nature of violence: “Violence is not an
isolated physical act or a discrete random event. It is a relation, process, and condition determining,
exploiting, and curtailing the well-being of the survivor…Violence occurs not only between individuals,
but also between groups and societies…Any relation, process, or condition imposed by someone that
injures the health and well-being of others is by definition violent.” As Kirk and Okazawa-Rey (2004)
point out, this definition not only includes sexual assault and domestic violence between individuals, but
also includes macro-level processes of inequality and violence, such as “colonization, poverty, racism,
lack of access to education, health care, and negative media representations” (Kirk and Okazawa-Rey
2004: 258). Importantly, Bulhan (1985) refers to people who have experienced violence as “survivors”
rather than “victims.” The difference between the two words is significant, in that the construction of
people who have experienced violence as “victims” maintains and reinforces their subordinate position,
while “survivors” emphasizes the agency and self-determination of people who have experienced
violence. Thus, we wish to underscore not only that sexual and intimate partner violence is systematic,
but that women and men have organized to combat sexual and domestic violence, and that women and
survivors of sexual and domestic violence have agency and exercise that agency.
Whereas our culture figures the home and family as a “haven in a heartless world,” the family and home
are common contexts for emotional and physical violence. As we pointed out in the section concerning
families, the notion of the normative family—with the concomitant gender roles we connote with the
SNAF—as a privatized sphere, is an ideological construction that often hides inequalities that exist
within families. Intimate partner violence refers to emotional and physical violence by one partner
against another and includes “current and former spouses, girlfriends, and boyfriends” (Kirk and
Okazawa-Rey 2004). Intimate partner violence occurs in queer as well as heterosexual relationships,
but this violence is quite clearly gendered in heterosexual relationships. The US Department of Justice
reported that 37% of women who visited emergency rooms for injuries from others were injured by
91

Introduction to Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies

male intimate partners. Additionally, researchers of sexual violence have found that one in five high
school girls surveyed reported that she had been physically or sexually abused. The majority of these
incidents occurred at home and happened more than once (Commonwealth Fund 1997). It is important
to note that these statistics only include those who actually sought medical care (in the case of the first
statistic) and/or reported an injury from a male intimate partner. As a result, this number may grossly
under-represent the actual number of women injured by intimate partners. Until the 1970s in the
United States, most states did not consider rape between spouses—or marital rape—a crime. This was
a legacy of coverture laws that existed until the 19th century, wherein women were thought to be the
property of their husbands, lacking any legal rights to personhood. Thus, the legal history of marriage
has played a part in constructing marital rape as somehow less damaging and violent than stranger
rape. Additionally, the de-valuation of women’s labor, and the fact that women are, on average, paid
77% of what men receive for the same work, reinforce women’s dependence on partners for survival,
even if these partners are abusive.
The history of institutionalized racism within police departments and law may make women within
communities of color less likely to report intimate partner violence or sexual violence. Women may not
report abuse from partners who are people of color because they do not want to expose their partners
to the criminal justice system, which—as the earlier section on the state, prison, and law discusses—has
disproportionately locked up people of color. Furthermore, past experiences with abusive police
officers, police brutality, or police indifference to calls for help may make many women of color reticent
to involve the police in cases of violence. Similarly, women who are undocumented immigrants and
living within the United States may not report sexual or intimate partner violence for fear of
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) sending them or their partner back to their country of
origin.
Psychologists, psychiatrists, and other medical professionals have crafted several “syndromes” used to
describe the effects of violence against women. While they have brought attention to the problem and
the need for treatment programs, these approaches to violence against women tend to individualize,
depoliticize, and medicalize gendered violence and often pathologize the survivor, rather than identify
the cultural conditions that compel abusers to abuse others. Battered Women’s Syndrome (BTS), put
forward by psychologist Lenore Walker, describes a woman who “learns helplessness” and returns to
her abuser because he (in this theory, only men are abusers and only women are survivors) lures her
back with promises not to harm her again, yet continues to abuse her. Another “syndrome” is Rape
Trauma Syndrome (RTS), which describes the “irrational” behaviors of women who have been
raped—behaviors that include “…not reporting a rape for days or even months, not remember parts of
the assault, appearing too calm, or expressing anger at their treatment by police, hospital staff, or the
legal system” (Kirk and Okazawa 2004: 265). Both of these descriptions of the impacts of violence have
successfully been used in court to prosecute perpetrators, but they also construct survivors as passive,
damaged victims who engage in “irrational” behavior. Activists who combat gendered violence and
violence against women have argued that people who experience sexual violence are in fact not passive
victims, but active agents who have the ability to organize and participate in anti-violence activism and
92

Introduction to Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies

organizations, as well as to hold their assailant responsible for their actions.

This unit has attempted to show how institutions are not merely benign, apolitical facets of our lives,
but active agents in our socialization, laden with ideology and power. They produce and reproduce
inequalities. Furthermore, as illustrated in the last section on gendered violence, institutions often
overlap and reinforce one another. This is because institutions are deeply social entities—even though
we may think of them as unaffected by society and culture. They exist in the same cultural-historical
periods and are created through the same structures of thought of that period. However, due to the
inordinate power of institutions and those at their heads—doctors, scientists, policy makers, experts,
etc.—the ideas of those in power within institutions are often the reigning ideas of an era. In this way,
institutions have an ideological facet—they are not only shaped by a particular cultural-historical
period, but also society is shaped and impacted by their interests, as well.

UNIT IV: GENDER AND WORK IN THE
GLOBAL ECONOMY

Introduction: Gender and Work in the
Global Economy
Work is an arena in which gendered processes intersect with multiple social inequalities to influence
what jobs people have, how they experience those jobs, and whether those jobs provide them with
secure, fulfilling and upwardly mobile careers, or relegate them to insecure, dead-end, dangerous, or
even degrading labor. In the US, hard work is supposed to lead to a whole host of social and material
rewards (i.e., respect, power, a house, a car, a yacht). The context surrounding hard work, for instance
whether that work is paid or unpaid, compensated at a minimum wage or six-figure salary, is gendered
in deep and complex ways. As we mentioned previously, childcare is hard work that is often underpaid
or not paid at all and is most often done by women. Furthermore, even if women do not perform most of
this work themselves, certain career trajectories are forced on them, and they are placed in lower
paying and less prestigious “mommy tracks” whether or not they choose this themselves. We can also
see institutionalized labor inequalities at the global scale by looking at who cares for North American
children when middle-class mothers take on full-time jobs and hire nannies, typically immigrant women
from Eastern Europe and the Global South, to care for their children.

Gender and Work in the US
Now, more than ever, women in the US are participating in the labor force in full-time, year-round
positions.Much of the material in this chapter was adapted from a classroom guest lecture by Dale Melcher, given
on October 26, 2009. This was not always the case. Changes in the economy (namely, the decline of men’s

wages), an increase in single-mothers, and education and job opportunities and cultural shifts created
by feminist movement politics from the 1960s and 1970s have fueled the increase in women’s labor
force participation. Dual-earner homes are much more common than the breadwinner-homemaker
model popularized in the 1950s, in which women stayed home and did unpaid labor (such as laundry,
cooking, childcare, cleaning) while men participated in the paid labor force in jobs that would earn
them enough money to support a spouse and children. It turns out this popular American fantasy, often
spoken of in political “family values” rhetoric, was only ever a reality for some white, middle-class
people, and, for most contemporary households, is now completely out of reach.
Though men and women are participating in the labor force, higher education, and paid work in nearequal numbers, a wage gap between men and women workers remains. On average, women workers
make 77% of what men make. This gap persists even when controlling for educational differences, fulltime work versus part-time work, and year-round versus seasonal occupational statuses. Thus, women
with similar educational backgrounds who work the same number of hours per year as their male
counterparts are making 23% less than similarly situated men. So, how can this gap be explained?
Researchers put forth four possible explanations of the gender wage gap: 1) discrimination; 2)
occupational segregation; 3) devalued work; and 4) inherent work-family conflicts.
Most people believe discrimination in hiring is a thing of the past. Since the 1964 Civil Rights Act
passed it has been illegal to discriminate in hiring based on race or gender. However, although
companies can no longer say “men only” in their hiring advertisements, they can make efforts to recruit
men, such as circulating job ads in men’s social networks and choosing men to interview from the
applicant pool. The same companies can also have non-accommodating family-leave provisions that may
discourage women, who they assume are disproportionately more likely to be primary caregivers, from
applying. In addition, discrimination cases are very difficult to prosecute legally since no government
agency monitors general trends and practices, and so individuals must complain about and prove
specific instances of discrimination in specific job settings. Hiring discrimination in particular is
extremely difficult to prove in a courtroom, and can thus persist largely unchecked. In addition, even
when they are hired, women working in male-dominated fields often run into a glass ceiling, in that
they face difficulties in being promoted to higher-level positions in the organization. One example of the
glass ceiling and gender discrimination is the class action lawsuit between Wal-Mart and its female
managerial staff. Although Wal-Mart has hired some women in managerial positions across the country,
they also have informal policies, at the national level, of promoting men faster and paying them at a
different wage scale. While only six women at Wal-Mart initiated the suit, the number of women that
99

Introduction to Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies

would be affected in this case numbered over 1.5 million. Wal-Mart fought this legal battle over the
course of ten years (2001-2011). The case was finally decided in June 2011 when the US Supreme Court
sided with the defendant, Wal-Mart, citing the difficulty of considering all women workers in Wal-Mart’s
retail empire as a coherent “class.” They agreed that discrimination against individuals was present, but
the fact that it could not be proven that women, as a class, were discriminated against by the Wal-Mart
corporation kept them from being found guilty (Wal-Mart Stores Inc. v. Dukes, et al., 2011). Although
Wal-Mart did nothing to curb its male managers who were clearly and consistently hiring and
promoting men over women, this neglect was not enough to convict Wal-Mart of class-action
discrimination. In this example, it becomes apparent that while gender discrimination is illegal it can
still happen in patterned and widespread ways. Additionally, there are a series of factors that make it
hard to prosecute gender discrimination.

Occupational segregation describes a split labor market in which one group is far more likely to do
certain types of work than other groups. Gendered occupational sex segregation describes situations in
which women are more likely to do certain jobs and men others. The jobs women are more likely to
work in have been dubbed “pink-collar” jobs. While “white collar” describes well-paying managerial
work and “blue collar” describes manual labor predominantly done by men with a full range of income
levels depending on skill, “pink collar” describes mostly low-wage, female-dominated positions that
involve services and, often, emotional labor. The term emotional labor, developed by sociologist Arlie
Russell Hochschild (1983), is used to describe work in which, as part of their job, employees must
100

Introduction to Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies

control and manage their emotions. For instance, a waitress risks being fired by confronting rude and
harassing customers with anger; she must both control her own emotions and help to quell the emotions
of angry customers in order to keep her job. Any service-based work that involves interacting with
customers (from psychiatrists to food service cashiers) also involves emotional labor. The top three
“pink-collar” occupations dominated by women workers—secretaries, teachers, and nurses—all involve
exceptional amounts of emotional labor.

Feminized work, or work thought to be “women’s work” is not only underpaid, it is also socially
undervalued, or taken to be worth less than work thought to be “men’s work.” Care work is an area of
the service economy that is feminized, involves intense emotional labor, and is consistently
undervalued. Caretakers of children and the elderly are predominantly women. Economist Nancy Folbre
(2001) has argued that care work is undervalued both because women are more likely to do it and
because it is considered to be natural for women to know how to care. Women have traditionally done
care work in the home, raising children and caring for sick and dying relatives, usually for free. Perhaps
this is because women bear children and are stereotyped as naturally more emotionally sensitive than
men.
Some feel it is wrong to ever pay for these services and that they should be done altruistically even by
non-family members. Women are stereotyped as having natural caring instincts, and, if these instincts
come naturally, there is no reason to pay well (or pay at all) for this work. In reality, care work requires
learned skills like any other type of work. What is interesting is that when men participate in this work,
and other pink-collar jobs, they actually tend to be paid better and to advance to higher-level positions
faster than comparable women. This phenomenon, in contrast to the glass ceiling, is known as the glass
escalator (Williams, 1992). However, Adia Harvey Wingfield (2009) has applied an intersectional
analysis to the glass escalator concept and found that men of color do not benefit from this system to
the extent that white men do.

Finally, the fourth explanation for the gender wage gap has to do with the conflict between work and
family that women are more likely to have to negotiate than men. For instance, women are much more
likely to interrupt their career trajectories to take time off to care for children. This is not an inherent
consequence of childbearing. Many countries offer women (and sometimes men) workers paid leave
time and the ability to return to their jobs with the same salaries and benefits as when they left them. In
contrast, the strongest legal policy protecting people’s jobs in the case of extended leave to care for the
sick or elderly, or take personal time for pregnancy and childcare in the United States is the Family and
Medical Leave Act (FMLA) of 1996. Under this act, most employers are obligated to allow their workers
to take up to twelve weeks of unpaid leave. Unfortunately, few people can afford to be away from their
jobs for so long without a paycheck and this policy remains underutilized. Additionally, only about half
of the US work force is eligible for leave under FMLA, because the act only applies to workers who are
employed by companies that have more than 50 employees. On top of that, many employers are
unaware of this act or do not inform their workers that they can take this time off. Thus, women are
more likely to quit full-time jobs and take on part-time jobs while their children are young. Quitting and
rejoining the labor force typically means starting at the bottom in terms of pay and status at a new
company, and this negatively impacts women’s overall earnings even when they return to full-time
work.

Gender and the US Welfare State
There are many ways that nations and national policies are gendered. In this section we will focus on
the U.S. welfare state. Here, we do not cover everything pertaining to the welfare state; we clarify
debates and provide examples. Welfare does not only come in its most-recognized form (monthly income
assistance), but also includes subsidized health insurance (Medicare and Medicaid) and childcare, social
security, and food subsidies like food stamps. In addition, the U.S. government pays subsidies to
corporations, which is called corporate welfare. Most individuals who receive welfare are stigmatized
and construed as undeserving, while the corporations that receive subsidies are seen as entitled to
these. The distribution of welfare in the US is a gendered process in which women, especially mothers,
are much more likely to receive assistance than men. Since, at the national level, women earn less
money than men do and often take time away from the labor force, it is more difficult to maintain a
single-parent household on one woman’s income than on one man’s income. This is even more difficult
for women who are working class or poor whose work may not even pay enough to stay well fed and
cared for without additional support from family, friends, or the state.
The Personal Responsibility/Work Opportunities Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) of 1996 effectively
dismantled US welfare policy. As we mentioned previously, the act limits lifetime receipt of welfare to a
maximum of 60 months. In addition, the act includes some gender-specific clauses to address the
political issue of mothers on welfare. Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich infamously
suggested that children of welfare mothers should be put into orphanages rather than be raised by the
women who birthed them. An incarnation of this sentiment made its way into PRWORA through an
optional state-level clause that would bar mothers who were already on welfare rolls from getting
additional money to support any new children (Hays, 2001). This clause, also known as the “family cap
provision,” effectively punishes children for being born and plays into the demeaning and erroneous
stereotype that women on welfare have children in order to get more money from the state. Feminist
political scientist Gwendolyn Mink argues that welfare reform targets poor single mothers and families
of color and contributes to the devaluing of unpaid care-giving work. According to Mink (2009), through
welfare reform, poor single mothers became:

…a separate caste, subject to a separate system of law. Poor single mothers are the only people
in America forced by law to work outside the home. They are the only people in America whose
decision to bear children are punished by the government…And they are the only mothers in
America compelled by law to make room for biological fathers in their families (Mink 2009:
540).
This example illustrates how state policies devalue the traditionally gendered care work that women
disproportionately perform, target poor women of color as subjects to be regulated, and reinforce
103

Introduction to Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies

heteronormative breadwinner-homemaker gender roles.
In addition, welfare is linked to state policies governing marriage and family life. For example, the Bush
Administration’s Healthy Marriages Initiative, which promoted marriage by providing government
funding, assumed that marriage reduces poverty. It is true that two incomes are often better than one.
However, not all mothers are heterosexual, or want to be married to the father of their children, or even
married at all. More than that, marriage is no guarantee of financial security, especially people living in
impoverished communities where they would likely marry other impoverished people. Most people
marry within their current economic class (Gerstel and Sarkisian 2006). Gingrich and others especially
hoped that women would marry the fathers of their children without recognizing that many women are
victims of intimate partner violence. Finally, we are also living in a period in which most marriages end
in divorce. It is clear that this initiative was more about promoting a political ideology than actually
attempting to remedy the social problem of poverty.
Discourses about welfare mothers invoke images that are gendered, classed, racialized, and sexualized.
This phrase speaks to race and sexuality issues as well as gender and class issues. The notions that
women on welfare breed children uncontrollably, never marry, and do not know who fathered their
children are contemporary incarnations of the Jezebel controlling image of Black women as sexually
promiscuous that originated during American slavery (Collins, 2005). This image obscures the fact that
during slavery and after emancipation, white men systematically raped Black women. Although most
people receiving welfare supports are white, and, in particular, most single mothers receiving welfare
are also white, welfare receipt is racialized such that the only images of welfare we seem to see are
single mothers of color. As we mentioned before, “the poor” are often framed as amoral, unfamiliar, and
un-American. If instead the receipt of welfare was not stigmatized, but was recognized as something
that families, friends, and neighbors received in various phases of their lives, these stereotypes would
lose traction.
For instance, the mother of one of the authors of this text receives social security for disability checks,
yet is staunchly anti-welfare. This contradiction is sustained by the idea that members of the white
middle class do not receive welfare even when they do receive various forms of government support.
Women disproportionately number among those in poverty around the world. The term feminization of
poverty describes the trend in the US and across the globe in which more and more women live in
impoverished conditions, despite the fact that many are working. Women’s unequal access to resources
and the disproportionate responsibility for unpaid work placed on them set up a situation in which
women can either be supported by a breadwinner or struggle to make ends meet. The global economic
crisis and long-standing unequal economic relationships between the Global North—a term that refers
to the world’s wealthier countries—and the Global South—a term that refers to the world’s poorer
countries—have made sustainable breadwinning wages, even among men, hard to attain.

Introduction to Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies

Transnational Production and
Globalization
Globalization is an oft-cited term that can usefully serve as shorthand. However, this shorthand runs
the risk of lumping together a broad range of complex economic, political, and cultural phenomena.
Globalization describes both the benefits and costs of living in a globally connected world. The Internet
was once heralded as the great equalizer in global communications. Certainly, we are now accustomed
to getting news from across the globe from a variety of perspectives. Activists in other countries, like
Egypt and Iran, have famously used social networking websites such as Facebook and Twitter to report
what is happening from the ground, in the absence of formal news sources. Egyptian activists also
utilized these social networking websites to coordinate demonstrations and marches, leading to the
Egyptian government to shut down the Internet for several days during the “Arab Spring” uprisings in
early 2011. Globalization makes it possible for social change activists in different countries to
communicate with each other, and for people, information, and products to cross borders, with benefits
for some and costs to others. It allows for Massachusetts residents to have fresh fruit in winter, but
lowers the wages of agricultural workers who gather the fruit in tropical countries, supports repressive
government policies in those countries, and increases the carbon footprint of producing and distributing
food. Globalized contexts can lead social movements and state, development and conservation agencies
to influence each other. For example, Colombian activists’ use of neoliberal development discourses
both legitimized the presence of state, development and conservation agencies and influenced these
agencies’ visions and plans (Asher 2009). As such, globalization is not uniformly good or bad, but has
costs and benefits that are experienced differently depending on one’s social location.
Nations of the world are linked in trade relationships. The US depends on resources and capabilities of
other nations to the extent that our economy relies on imports (e.g., oil, cars, food, manufactured
goods). So, how is it that the US economy is still largely profitable? Factories in the US producing
manufactured goods did not simply close down in the face of competition; multinational
corporations—corporations that exist across several political borders—made concerted efforts to
increase their profits (Kirk & Okizawa-Rey 2007). One way to massively increase profits is to pay
workers less in wages and benefits. In the US, labor laws and union contracts protect workers from
working extensive hours at a single job, guarantee safe working environments, and set a minimum
wage. Thus, American workers are expensive to corporations. This is why companies based in the US
outsource production to the nations of the Global South where workers’ rights are less protected and
workers make less money for their labor. One consequence of outsourcing is the development of
sweatshops (known as maquiladoras when based in Mexico in particular) in which workers work long
hours for little pay and are restricted from eating or using the restroom while at work (Kirk & OkizawaRey 2007). These workers seldom purchase the goods they assist in producing, often because they could
105

Introduction to Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies

not afford them, and because the global factories in which they work ship goods to be sold in wealthier
countries of the Global North. These factories predominantly employ young, unmarried women workers
in Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean because they are considered the most docile and obedient
groups of workers; that is, corporations consider them less likely to make demands of employers or to
unionize (Kirk & Okizawa-Rey 2007).

Rather than a nation’s workers producing goods, selling those goods back to its people, and keeping
profits within the nation’s borders, multinational corporations participate in global commodity
chains. As Cynthia Enloe’s (2008) article “The Globetrotting Sneaker” makes clear, globalization makes
it possible for a shoe corporation based in Country A to extract resources from Country B, produce
goods in Country C, sell those goods in Countries D, E, and F, and deposit waste in the landfills of
Country G. Meanwhile, the profits from this production and sales of goods return largely to the
corporation, while little goes into the economies of the participating nations (Enloe 2008). Companies
like Nike, Adidas, and Reebok were initially attracted by military regimes in South Korea in the 1980s
that quashed labor unions. Once the workers in South Korea organized successfully, factories moved to
Indonesia (Enloe 2008). This process of moving to remaining areas of cheap labor before workers
organize is known as the race to the bottom logic of global factory production.
With the increasing globalization of the economy international institutions have been created. The
purpose of these international institutions is, ostensibly, to monitor abuses and assist in the
development of less developed nations through loans from more developed nations. The World Bank
provides monetary support for large, capital-intensive projects such as the construction of roads and
dams. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) provides loans and facilitates international trade
relationships particularly through structural adjustment programs (SAP). Essentially, in a SAP, a
country of the Global North lends money to another country in the Global South in exchange for
resources. For instance, the US may lend money to Chile to assist with the growth and harvesting of
grapes and production of wine. In exchange, the US would acquire grapes and wine from Chile at a
discounted rate, and have control in how Chile spends the money, while Chile repays the initial loan.
106

Introduction to Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies

The problem with this is that, in many cases, the lending process is circular such that the country
accepting the loan remains constantly indebted to the initial lending nation. For example, a nation may
produce most of its crop to export elsewhere and be unable to feed its own people and therefore require
additional loans. Consequences of SAPs are devalued currency, privatized industries, cut social
programs and government subsidies, and increasing taxes to fund the development of infrastructure.
Free trade describes a set of institutions, policies, and ideologies, in which the governmental
restrictions and regulations are minimal, allowing corporate bodies to engage in cross-border
enterprises to maximize profit. One institution that was created to foster free trade is the World Trade
Organization (WTO), an international unelected body whose mission is to challenge restraints on free
trade. Some countries limit pollution levels in industry; the WTO considers any limits on production as
barriers to free trade. They operate on the theory that unfettered, free market capitalism is the best
way to generate profits. It may be more profitable to pay people minimally and circumvent
environmental regulations, but proponents of free trade do not factor in the human costs to health,
safety, and happiness—costs that cannot be put into dollars and cents. One such free trade agreement is
the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) of 1994. NAFTA is an agreement between Canada,
the US, and Mexico to promote the unregulated movement of jobs and products. The biggest result of
this legislation is the mass relocation of factories from the US to Mexico in the form of maquiladoras
that supply goods at low prices back to US consumers, resulting in a loss of around 500,000 union jobs
in North America (Zinn 2003). The Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) of 2002 expands NAFTA to
include the entire Western hemisphere—except Cuba, due to trade sanctions against its communist
government. At the time of this writing, the impact of these free trade agreements is a hotly contested
political issue. Some people have argued that it resulted in unionized, higher paying jobs, while others
have argued that even with many negative impacts, overall access to jobs, products, and resources has
yielded many improvements. In the face of moves to promote free trade, fair trade movements that
support safe working conditions and sustainable wages have also cropped up, especially in the coffee
and chocolate industries.
The current global economic system is guided by an ideology of neoliberalism. In the contemporary U.S.
context, the term “liberal” is identified with the American Democratic Party, but in terms of political
theory, the term liberalism refers to restrictions on state power to prevent government infringement
on individual rights (Grewal and Kaplan 1994), which transcend party affiliations. Economic
liberalism, the belief that markets work best without any governmental regulation or interference,
describes the free trade economic policies we discussed above, and should not be confused with the
liberalism associated with the Democratic Party. Neoliberalism is a market-driven approach to
economic and social policy, where capitalism’s profit motive is applied to social policies and programs
(like welfare and taxation), cutting them to increase profits. A crucial project of neoliberalism is the
downsizing of the public sphere and social welfare programs that unions and racial justice activists have
fought for since the early 20th Century. Feminist historian Lisa Duggan (2003) argues that
neoliberalism is more than just the privatization of the economy, but is an ideology that holds that once
marginalized groups (LGBTQ people, people of color, the working-class) have access to mainstream
107

Introduction to Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies

institutions (like marriage and service in the military) and consumption in the free market, they have
reached equality with their privileged peers (straight people, white people, the middle- and upperclasses). Neoliberal ideology therefore assumes that our society has reached a post-civil rights period
where social movements that seek to fundamentally alter mainstream institutions and build up social
welfare programs are obsolete. However, as this textbook has shown, mainstream institutions and
structures of power often reproduce inequalities.

108

Introduction to Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies

Racialized, Gendered, and Sexualized
Labor in the Global Economy
The structure of the global economy affects people differently not only by the economic situations of the
nations in which they live, but also by gender and race. Predatory trade relationships between countries
roughly reproduce the political situation of colonization in many nations of the Global South. This has
led many to characterize neoliberal economic policies as a form of neocolonialism, or modern day
colonization characterized by exploitation of a nation’s resources and people. Colonialism and
neocolonialism are concepts that draw attention to the racialized global inequalities between white,
affluent people of the Global North—historical colonizers—and people of color of the Global South—the
historically colonized. Postcolonial theory emerged out of critiques of colonialism, empire,
enslavement, and neocolonial racist-economic oppression more generally, which were advanced by
scholars in the Asian and Middle Eastern diasporas. Postcolonial scholars primarily unpack and critique
colonial discourses, depictions of colonized Others, and European scholars’ biased representations of
those they colonized, which they figure as knowledge (for example, see Said 1995 and Spivak 1988).
Decoloniality theoretical approaches, emerging chiefly in Latin America, illuminated how colonization
invented the concepts of “the colonized,” “modernity” and “coloniality,” and disrupted the social
arrangements, lives, gender relations, and understandings it invaded, imposing on the colonized
European racialized conceptualizations of male and female (Quijano 2007; Lugones 2007).
Women of color of the Global South are disproportionately impacted by global economic policies. Not
only are women in Asian and Latin American countries much more likely to work in low-wage factory
jobs than men, women are also much more mobile in terms of immigration (Pessar 2005). Women have
more labor-based mobility for low-income factory work in other countries as well as in domestic and sex
work markets. When women immigrate to other nations they often sacrifice care of and contact with
their own children in order to earn money caring for wealthier people’s children as domestic workers;
this situation is known as transnational motherhood (Parreñas 2001). Domestic work and sex work
are two sectors of the service economy in which women immigrants participate. Immigrants, especially
undocumented immigrants, have few options in terms of earning money, and economic circumstances
are such that undocumented immigrants can make more money within illegal and unregulated markets
in nations of the Global North, rather than regulated markets of the formal economy. Thus, it is not
uncommon for women immigrants to participate in informal economies such as domestic work or sex
work that employers and clients do not report in their taxes.
Women immigrants also participate in other parts of the service economy of the Global North. Miliann
Kang (2010) has studied immigrant women who participate in beauty service work, particularly nail
salons. This type of work does not require high amounts of skill or experience and can support women
for whom English is a second language or those who may be undocumented. Like any service job, work
109

Introduction to Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies

in nail salons involves emotional labor. While clients may see the technician in the beauty salon as their
confidant (like Queen Latifa’s character in Beauty Shop), their relationship is primarily an unequal labor
relationship in which one party is paid not only for the service they perform but also for their friendly
personalities and listening skills. Kang (2010) refers to this type of labor involving both emotional and
physical labor as body labor. To engage in both emotional and physical labor at work is exhausting. In
addition, workers in nail and hair salons work with harsh chemicals that are ultimately toxic to their
health and make them more susceptible to cancer than the general population.

Not only do gendered, racialized, and sexualized differences exist in the US domestic labor market,
leading to differences in work and pay, these differences also characterize the globalized labor market.
Trade relationships between countries and the ideology of neoliberalism that governs them have
profound effects on the quality of life of people all over the world. Women bear the brunt of changes to
the global marketplace as factory workers in some countries and domestic, sex, and beauty service
workers in others. Fortunately, fair trade and anti-sweatshop movements as well as indigenous,
decolonial, feminist and labor movements are fighting to change these conditions for the better in the
face of well-funded and powerful multinational corporations and global trade organizations.

UNIT V: HISTORICAL AND
CONTEMPORARY FEMINIST SOCIAL
MOVEMENTS

Introduction: Feminist Movements
“History is also everybody talking at once, multiple rhythms being played simultaneously. The events
and people we write about did not occur in isolation but in dialogue with a myriad of other people and
events. In fact, at any given moment millions of people are all talking at once. As historians we try to
isolate one conversation and to explore it, but the trick is then how to put that conversation in a context
which makes evident its dialogue with so many others—how to make this one lyric stand alone and at
the same time be in connection with all the other lyrics being sung.”
—Elsa Barkley Brown, “’What has happened here,’” pp. 297-298.
Feminist historian Elsa Barkley Brown reminds us that social movements and identities are not separate
from each other, as we often imagine they are in contemporary society. She argues that we must have a
relational understanding of social movements and identities within and between social movements—an
understanding of the ways in which privilege and oppression are linked and how the stories of people of
color and feminists fighting for justice have been historically linked through overlapping and sometimes
conflicting social movements. In this chapter, we use a relational lens to discuss and make sense of
feminist movements, beginning in the 19th Century up to the present time. Although we use the terms
“first wave,” “second wave,” and “third wave,” characterizing feminist resistance in these “waves” is
problematic, as it figures distinct “waves” of activism as prioritizing distinct issues in each time period,
obscuring histories of feminist organizing in locations and around issues not discussed in the dominant
“waves” narratives. Indeed, these “waves” are not mutually exclusive or totally separate from each
other. In fact, they inform each other, not only in the way that contemporary feminist work has in many
ways been made possible by earlier feminist activism, but also in the way that contemporary feminist
activism informs the way we think of past feminist activism and feminisms. Nonetheless, understanding
that the “wave” language has historical meaning, we use it throughout this section. Relatedly, although
a focus on prominent leaders and events can obscure the many people and actions involved in everyday
resistance and community organizing, we focus on the most well known figures, political events, and
social movements, understanding that doing so advances one particular lens of history.
Additionally, feminist movements have generated, made possible, and nurtured feminist theories and
feminist academic knowledge. In this way, feminist movements are fantastic examples of praxis—that
is, they use critical reflection about the world to change it. It is because of various social
movements—feminist activism, workers’ activism, and civil rights activism throughout the 19th, 20th,
and 21st centuries—that “feminist history” is a viable field of study today. Feminist history is part of a
larger historical project that draws on the experiences of traditionally ignored and disempowered
groups (e.g., factory workers, immigrants, people of color, lesbians) to re-think and challenge the
histories that have been traditionally written from the experiences and points of view of the powerful
(e.g., colonizers, representatives of the state, the wealthy)—the histories we typically learn in high

19th Century Feminist Movements
What has come to be called the first wave of the feminist movement began in the mid 19th century and
lasted until the passage of the 19th Amendment in 1920, which gave women the right to vote. White
middle-class first wave feminists in the 19th century to early 20th century, such as suffragist leaders
Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony, primarily focused on women’s suffrage (the right to
vote), striking down coverture laws, and gaining access to education and employment. These goals are
famously enshrined in the Seneca Falls Declaration of Sentiments, which is the resulting document of
the first women’s rights convention in the United States in 1848.

Demanding women’s enfranchisement, the abolition of coverture, and access to employment and
education were quite radical demands at the time. These demands confronted the ideology of the cult
of true womanhood, summarized in four key tenets—piety, purity, submission and domesticity—which
116

Introduction to Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies

held that white women were rightfully and naturally located in the private sphere of the household and
not fit for public, political participation or labor in the waged economy. However, this emphasis on
confronting the ideology of the cult of true womanhood was shaped by the white middle-class
standpoint of the leaders of the movement. As we discussed in Chapter 3, the cult of true womanhood
was an ideology of white womanhood that systematically denied black and working-class women access
to the category of “women,” because working-class and black women, by necessity, had to labor outside
of the home.
The white middle-class leadership of the first wave movement shaped the priorities of the movement,
often excluding the concerns and participation of working-class women and women of color. For
example, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony formed the National Women Suffrage
Association (NWSA) in order to break from other suffragists who supported the passage of the 15th
Amendment, which would give African American men the right to vote before women. Stanton and
Anthony privileged white women’s rights instead of creating solidarities across race and class groups.
Accordingly, they saw women’s suffrage as the central goal of the women’s rights movement. For
example, in the first issue of her newspaper, The Revolution, Susan B. Anthony wrote, “We shall show
that the ballot will secure for woman equal place and equal wages in the world of work; that it will open
to her the schools, colleges, professions, and all the opportunities and advantages of life; that in her
hand it will be a moral power to stay the tide of crime and misery on every side” (cited by Davis 1981:
73). Meanwhile, working-class women and women of color knew that mere access to voting did not
overturn class and race inequalities. As feminist activist and scholar Angela Davis (1981) writes,
working-class women “…were seldom moved by the suffragists’ promise that the vote would permit
them to become equal to their men—their exploited, suffering men” (Davis 1981: 74-5). Furthermore,
the largest suffrage organization, the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA)—a
descendent of the National Women Suffrage Association—barred the participation of Black women
suffragists in its organization.
Although the first wave movement was largely defined and led by middle class white women, there was
significant overlap between it and the abolitionist movement—which sought to end slavery—and the
racial justice movement following the end of the Civil War. Historian Nancy Cott (2000) argues that, in
some ways, both movements were largely about having self-ownership and control over one’s body. For
slaves, that meant the freedom from lifelong, unpaid, forced labor, as well as freedom from the sexual
assault that many enslaved Black women suffered from their masters. For married white women, it
meant recognition as people in the face of the law and the ability to refuse their husbands’ sexual
advances. White middle-class abolitionists often made analogies between slavery and marriage, as
abolitionist Antoinette Brown wrote in 1853 that, “The wife owes service and labor to her husband as
much and as absolutely as the slave does to his master” (Brown, cited. in Cott 2000: 64). This analogy
between marriage and slavery had historical resonance at the time, but it problematically conflated the
unique experience of the racialized oppression of slavery that African American women faced with a
very different type of oppression that white women faced under coverture. This illustrates quite well
Angela Davis’ (1983) argument that while white women abolitionists and feminists of the time made
117

Introduction to Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies

important contributions to anti-slavery campaigns, they often failed to understand the uniqueness and
severity of slave women’s lives and the complex system of chattel slavery.
Black activists, writers, newspaper publishers, and academics moved between the racial justice and
feminist movements, arguing for inclusion in the first wave feminist movement and condemning slavery
and Jim Crow laws that maintained racial segregation. Sojourner Truth’s famous “Ain’t I a Woman?”
speech, which has been attributed to the Akron Women’s Convention in 1851, captured this contentious
linkage between the first wave women’s movement and the abolitionist movement well. In her speech,
she critiqued the exclusion of black women from the women’s movement while simultaneously
condemning the injustices of slavery:

That man over there says that women need to be helped into carriages, and lifted over ditches,
and to have the best place everywhere. Nobody ever helps me into carriages, or over mudpuddles, or gives me any best place! And ain’t I a woman? Look at me! Look at my arm! I have
ploughed and planted, and gathered into barns, and no man could head me!….I have borne
thirteen children, and seen most all sold off to slavery, and when I cried out with my mother’s
grief, none but Jesus heard me! And ain’t I a woman?
Feminist historian Nell Painter (1996) has questioned the validity of this representation of the speech,
arguing that white suffragists dramatically changed its content and title. This illustrates that certain
social actors with power can construct the story and possibly misrepresent actors with less power and
social movements.

Despite their marginalization, Black women emerged as passionate and powerful leaders. Ida B. Wells ,
a particularly influential activist who participated in the movement for women’s suffrage, was a
founding member of the National Association of the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), a
journalist, and the author of numerous pamphlets and articles exposing the violent lynching of
thousands of African Americans in the Reconstruction period (the period following the Civil War). Wells
argued that lynching in the Reconstruction Period was a systematic attempt to maintain racial
inequality, despite the passage of the 14th Amendment in 1868 (which held that African Americans
were citizens and could not be discriminated against based on their race) (Wells 1893). Additionally,
thousands of African American women were members of the National Association of Colored Women’s
Clubs, which was pro-suffrage, but did not receive recognition from the predominantly middle-class,
white National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA).
The passage of the 19th Amendment in 1920 provided a test for the argument that the granting of
119

Introduction to Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies

women’s right to vote would give them unfettered access to the institutions they had been denied from,
as well as equality with men. Quite plainly, this argument was proven wrong, as had been the case with
the passage of the 18th Amendment followed by a period of backlash. The formal legal endorsement of
the doctrine of “separate but equal” with Plessy v. Ferguson in 1896, the complex of Jim Crow laws in
states across the country, and the unchecked violence of the Ku Klux Klan, prevented Black women and
men from access to voting, education, employment, and public facilities. While equal rights existed in
the abstract realm of the law under the 18th and 19th amendments, the on-the-ground reality of
continued racial and gender inequality was quite different.

120

Early to Late 20th Century Feminist
Movements
Social movements are not static entities; they change according to movement gains or losses, and these
gains or losses are often quite dependent on the political and social contexts they take place within.
Following women’s suffrage in 1920, feminist activists channeled their energy into institutionalized
legal and political channels for effecting changes in labor laws and attacking discrimination against
women in the workplace. The Women’s Bureau—a federal agency created to craft policy according to
women workers’ needs—was established in 1920, and the YWCA, the American Association of
University Women (AAUW), and the National Federation of Business and Professional Women (BPW)
lobbied government officials to pass legislation that would legally prohibit discrimination against
women in the workplace.
These organizations, however, did not necessarily agree on what equality looked like and how that
would be achieved. For example, the BPW supported the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), which they
argued would effectively end employment discrimination against women. Meanwhile, the Women’s
Bureau and the YWCA opposed the ERA, arguing that it would damage the gains that organized labor
had made already. The disagreement clearly brought into relief the competing agendas of defining
working women first and foremost as women (who are also workers), versus defining working women
first and foremost as workers (who are also women). Nearly a century after suffrage, the ERA has yet to
be passed, and debate about its desirability even within the feminist movement continues.
While millions of women were already working in the United States at the beginning of World War II,
labor shortages during World War II allowed millions of women to move into higher-paying factory jobs
that had previously been occupied by men. Simultaneously, nearly 125,000 African American men
fought in segregated units in World War II, often being sent on the front guard of the most dangerous
missions (Zinn 2003). Japanese Americans whose families were interned also fought in the segregated
units that had the war’s highest casualty rates (Odo 2017; Takaki 2001). Following the end of the war,
both the women who had worked in high-paying jobs in factories and the African American men who
had fought in the war returned to a society that was still deeply segregated, and they were expected to
return to their previous subordinate positions. Despite the conservative political climate of the 1950s,
civil rights organizers began to challenge both the de jure segregation of Jim Crow laws and the de
facto segregation experienced by African Americans on a daily basis. The landmark Brown v. Board of
Education ruling of 1954, which made “separate but equal” educational facilities illegal, provided an
essential legal basis for activism against the institutionalized racism of Jim Crow laws. Eventually, the
Black Freedom Movement, also known now as the civil rights movement would fundamentally change
US society and inspire the second wave feminist movement and the radical political movements of the
New Left (e.g., gay liberationism, black nationalism, socialist and anarchist activism, the
121

Introduction to Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies

environmentalist movement) in the late 1960s.
Although the stories and lives of the leaders of the civil rights movement are centered in popular
representations, this grassroots mass movement was composed of working class African American men
and women, white and African American students, and clergy that utilized the tactics of non-violent
direct action (e.g., sit-ins, marches, and vigils) to demand full legal equality for African Americans in US
society. For example, Rosa Parks—famous for refusing to give up her seat at the front of a Montgomery
bus to a white passenger in December, 1955 and beginning the Montgomery Bus Boycott—was not
acting as an isolated, frustrated woman when she refused to give up her seat at the front of the bus (as
the typical narrative goes). According to feminist historians Ellen Debois and Lynn Dumenil (2005),
Parks “had been active in the local NAACP for fifteen years, and her decision to make this stand against
segregation was part of a lifelong commitment to racial justice. For some time NAACP leaders had
wanted to find a good test case to challenge Montgomery’s bus segregation in courts” (Debois and
Dumenil, 2005: 576). Furthermore, the bus boycott that ensued after Parks’ arrest and lasted for 381
days, until its success, was an organized political action involving both working-class African American
and white women activists. The working-class Black women who relied on public transportation to go to
their jobs as domestic servants in white households refused to use the bus system, and either walked to
work or relied on rides to work from a carpool organized by women activists. Furthermore, the
Women’s Political Caucus of Montgomery distributed fliers promoting the boycott and had provided the
groundwork and planning to execute the boycott before it began.

Additionally, the sit-in movement was sparked by the Greensboro sit-ins, when four African American
students in Greensboro, North Carolina, sat at and refused to leave a segregated lunch counter at a
Woolworth’s store in February of 1960. The number of students participating in the sit-ins increased as
the days and weeks went on, and the sit-ins began to receive national media attention. Networks of
student activists began sharing the successes of the tactic of the nonviolent sit-in, and began doing sitins in their own cities and towns around the country throughout the early 1960s.

Importantly, the sit-in movement led to the formation of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating
Committee (SNCC), initiated by Ella Baker shortly after the first sit-in strikes in Greensboro. The
student activists of SNCC took part in the Freedom Rides of 1961, with African American and white
men and women participants, and sought to challenge the Jim Crow laws of the south, which the
Interstate Commerce Commission had ruled to be unconstitutional. The freedom riders experienced
brutal mob violence in Birmingham and were jailed, but the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) and
SNCC kept sending riders to fill the jails of Birmingham. SNCC also participated in Freedom Summer in
1964, which was a campaign that brought mostly white students from the north down to the south to
support the work of Black southern civil rights activists for voting rights for African Americans. Once
again, Freedom Summer activists faced mob violence, but succeeded in bringing national attention to
southern states’ foot-dragging in terms of allowing African Americans the legal rights they had won
through activism and grassroots organizing.

SNCC’s non-hierarchical structure gave women chances to participate in the civil rights movement in
ways previously blocked to them. However, the deeply embedded sexism of the surrounding culture still
seeped into civil rights organizations, including SNCC. Although women played pivotal roles as
organizers and activists throughout the civil rights movement, men occupied the majority of formal
leadership roles in the Southern Christian Leadership Council (SCLC), the NAACP, and CORE. Working
with SNCC, Black women activists such as Fannie Lou Hamer and Diane Nash became noted activists
and leaders within the civil rights movement in the early 1960s. Despite this, women within SNCC were
often expected to do “women’s work” (i.e., housework and secretarial work). White women SNCC
activists Casey Hayden and Mary King critiqued this reproduction of gendered roles within the
movement and called for dialogue about sexism within the civil rights movement in a memo that
circulated through SNCC in 1965, titled “Sex and Caste: A Kind of Memo.” The memo became an
influential document for the birth of the second wave feminist movement, a movement focused
generally on fighting patriarchal structures of power, and specifically on combating occupational sex
segregation in employment and fighting for reproductive rights for women. However, this was not the
only source of second wave feminism, and white women were not the only women spearheading
feminist movements. As historian Becky Thompson (2002) argues, in the mid and late 1960s, Latina
women, African American women, and Asian American women were developing multiracial feminist
organizations that would become important players within the U.S. second wave feminist movement.
In many ways, the second wave feminist movement was influenced and facilitated by the activist tools
provided by the civil rights movement. Drawing on the stories of women who participated in the civil
rights movement, historians Ellen Debois and Lynn Dumenil (2005) argue that women’s participation in
125

Introduction to Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies

the civil rights movement allowed them to challenge gender norms that held that women belonged in
the private sphere, and not in politics or activism. Not only did many women who were involved in the
civil rights movement become activists in the second wave feminist movement, they also employed
tactics that the civil rights movement had used, including marches and non-violent direct action.
Additionally, the Civil Rights Act of 1964—a major legal victory for the civil rights movement—not only
prohibited employment discrimination based on race, but Title VII of the Act also prohibited sex
discrimination. When the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)—the federal agency
created to enforce Title VII—largely ignored women’s complaints of employment discrimination, 15
women and one man organized to form the National Organization of Women (NOW), which was
modeled after the NAACP. NOW focused its attention and organizing on passage of the Equal Rights
Amendment (ERA), fighting sex discrimination in education, and defending Roe v. Wade—the Supreme
Court decision of 1973 that struck down state laws that prohibited abortion within the first three
months of pregnancy.

Although the second wave feminist movement challenged gendered inequalities and brought women’s
issues to the forefront of national politics in the late 1960s and 1970s, the movement also reproduced
race and sex inequalities. Black women writers and activists such as Alice Walker, bell hooks, and
Patricia Hill Collins developed Black feminist thought as a critique of the ways in which second wave
feminists often ignored racism and class oppression and how they uniquely impact women and men of
color and working-class people. One of the first formal Black feminist organizations was the Combahee
River Collective, formed in 1974. Black feminist bell hooks (1984) argued that feminism cannot just be a
fight to make women equal with men, because such a fight does not acknowledge that all men are not
equal in a capitalist, racist, and homophobic society. Thus, hooks and other Black feminists argued that
sexism cannot be separated from racism, classism and homophobia, and that these systems of
domination overlap and reinforce each other. Therefore, she argued, you cannot fight sexism without
fighting racism, classism, and homophobia. Importantly, black feminism argues that an intersectional
126

Introduction to Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies

perspective that makes visible and critiques multiple sources of oppression and inequality also inspires
coalitional activism that brings people together across race, class, gender, and sexual identity lines.

127

Third Wave and Queer Feminist
Movements
“We are living in a world for which old forms of activism are not enough and today’s activism is about
creating coalitions between communities.”
—Angela Davis, cited by Hernandez and Rehman in Colonize This!
Third wave feminism is, in many ways, a hybrid creature. It is influenced by second wave feminism,
Black feminisms, transnational feminisms, Global South feminisms, and queer feminism. This hybridity
of third wave activism comes directly out of the experiences of feminists in the late 20th and early 21st
centuries who have grown up in a world that supposedly does not need social movements because
“equal rights” for racial minorities, sexual minorities, and women have been guaranteed by law in most
countries. The gap between law and reality—between the abstract proclamations of states and concrete
lived experience—however, reveals the necessity of both old and new forms of activism. In a country
where white women are paid only 75.3% of what white men are paid for the same labor (Institute for
Women’s Policy Research 2016), where police violence in black communities occurs at much higher
rates than in other communities, where 58% of transgender people surveyed experienced mistreatment
from police officers in the past year (James et. al 2016), where 40% of homeless youth organizations’
clientele are gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender (Durso and Gates 2012), where people of color—on
average—make less income and have considerably lower amounts of wealth than white people, and
where the military is the most funded institution by the government, feminists have increasingly
realized that a coalitional politics that organizes with other groups based on their shared (but
differing) experiences of oppression, rather than their specific identity, is absolutely necessary. Thus,
Leslie Heywood and Jennifer Drake (1997) argue that a crucial goal for the third wave is “the
development of modes of thinking that can come to terms with the multiple, constantly shifting bases of
oppression in relation to the multiple, interpenetrating axes of identity, and the creation of a coalitional
politics based on these understandings” (Heywood and Drake 1997: 3).

In the 1980s and 1990s, third wave feminists took up activism in a number of forms. Beginning in the
mid 1980s, the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP) began organizing to press an unwilling US
government and medical establishment to develop affordable drugs for people with HIV/AIDS. In the
latter part of the 1980s, a more radical subset of individuals began to articulate a queer politics,
explicitly reclaiming a derogatory term often used against gay men and lesbians, and distancing
themselves from the gay and lesbian rights movement, which they felt mainly reflected the interests of
white, middle-class gay men and lesbians. As discussed at the beginning of this text, queer also
described anti-categorical sexualities. The queer turn sought to develop more radical political
perspectives and more inclusive sexual cultures and communities, which aimed to welcome and support
transgender and gender non-conforming people and people of color. This was motivated by an
intersectional critique of the existing hierarchies within sexual liberation movements, which
marginalized individuals within already sexually marginalized groups. In this vein, Lisa Duggan (2002)
coined the term homonormativity, which describes the normalization and depoliticization of gay men
and lesbians through their assimilation into capitalist economic systems and domesticity—individuals
who were previously constructed as “other.” These individuals thus gained entrance into social life at
the expense and continued marginalization of queers who were non-white, disabled, trans, single or
non-monogamous, middle-class, or non-western. Critiques of homonormativity were also critiques of gay
identity politics, which left out concerns of many gay individuals who were marginalized within gay
129

Introduction to Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies

groups. Akin to homonormativity, Jasbir Puar coined the term homonationalism, which describes the
white nationalism taken up by queers, which sustains racist and xenophobic discourses by constructing
immigrants, especially Muslims, as homophobic (Puar 2007). Identity politics refers to organizing
politically around the experiences and needs of people who share a particular identity. The move from
political association with others who share a particular identity to political association with those who
have differing identities, but share similar, but differing experiences of oppression (coalitional politics),
can be said to be a defining characteristic of the third wave.
Another defining characteristic of the third wave is the development of new tactics to politicize feminist
issues and demands. For instance, ACT UP began to use powerful street theater that brought the death
and suffering of people with HIV/AIDS to the streets and to the politicians and pharmaceutical
companies that did not seem to care that thousands and thousands of people were dying. They staged
die-ins , inflated massive condoms, and occupied politicians’ and pharmaceutical executives’ offices.
Their confrontational tactics would be emulated and picked up by anti-globalization activists and the
radical Left throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. Queer Nation was formed in 1990 by ACT UP
activists, and used the tactics developed by ACT UP in order to challenge homophobic violence and
heterosexism in mainstream US society.

of uniformed officers, some on horseback, protected NIH headquarters
during the “Storm the NIH” demonstration on May 21, 1990. “ACT UP

Around the same time as ACT UP was beginning to organize in the mid-1980s, sex-positive feminism
came into currency among feminist activists and theorists. Amidst what is known now as the “Feminist
Sex Wars” of the 1980s, sex-positive feminists argued that sexual liberation, within a sex-positive
culture that values consent between partners, would liberate not only women, but also men. Drawing
from a social constructionist perspective, sex-positive feminists such as cultural anthropologist Gayle
Rubin (1984) argued that no sexual act has an inherent meaning, and that not all sex, or all
representations of sex, were inherently degrading to women. In fact, they argued, sexual politics and
sexual liberation are key sites of struggle for white women, women of color, gay men, lesbians, queers,
and transgender people—groups of people who have historically been stigmatized for their sexual
identities or sexual practices. Therefore, a key aspect of queer and feminist subcultures is to create sex131

positive spaces and communities that not only valorize sexualities that are often stigmatized in the
broader culture, but also place sexual consent at the center of sex-positive spaces and communities.
Part of this project of creating sex-positive, feminist and queer spaces is creating media messaging that
attempts to both consolidate feminist communities and create knowledge from and for oppressed
groups.
In a media-savvy generation, it is not surprising that cultural production is a main avenue of activism
taken by contemporary activists. Although some commentators have deemed the third wave to be “postfeminist” or “not feminist” because it often does not utilize the activist forms (e.g., marches, vigils, and
policy change) of the second wave movement (Sommers, 1994), the creation of alternative forms of
culture in the face of a massive corporate media industry can be understood as quite political. For
example, the Riot Grrrl movement, based in the Pacific Northwest of the US in the early 1990s,
consisted of do-it-yourself bands predominantly composed of women, the creation of independent
record labels, feminist ‘zines, and art. Their lyrics often addressed gendered sexual violence, sexual
liberationism, heteronormativity, gender normativity, police brutality, and war. Feminist news websites
and magazines have also become important sources of feminist analysis on current events and issues.
Magazines such as Bitch and Ms., as well as online blog collectives such as Feministing and the
Feminist Wire function as alternative sources of feminist knowledge production. If we consider the
creation of lives on our own terms and the struggle for autonomy as fundamental feminist acts of
resistance, then creating alternative culture on our own terms should be considered a feminist act of
resistance as well.
As we have mentioned earlier, feminist activism and theorizing by people outside the US context has
broadened the feminist frameworks for analysis and action. In a world characterized by global
capitalism, transnational immigration, and a history of colonialism that has still has effects today,
transnational feminism is a body of theory and activism that highlights the connections between
sexism, racism, classism, and imperialism. In “Under Western Eyes,” an article by transnational feminist
theorist Chandra Talpade Mohanty (1991), Mohanty critiques the way in which much feminist activism
and theory has been created from a white, North American standpoint that has often exoticized “3rd
world” women or ignored the needs and political situations of women in the Global South. Transnational
feminists argue that Western feminist projects to “save” women in another region do not actually
liberate these women, since this approach constructs the women as passive victims devoid of agency to
save themselves. These “saving” projects are especially problematic when they are accompanied by
Western military intervention. For instance, in the war on Afghanistan, begun shortly after 9/11 in 2001,
U.S. military leaders and George Bush often claimed to be waging the war to “save” Afghani women
from their patriarchal and domineering men. This crucially ignores the role of the West—and the US in
particular—in supporting Islamic fundamentalist regimes in the 1980s. Furthermore, it positions women
in Afghanistan as passive victims in need of Western intervention—in a way strikingly similar to the
victimizing rhetoric often used to talk about “victims” of gendered violence (discussed in an earlier
section). Therefore, transnational feminists challenge the notion—held by many feminists in the
West—that any area of the world is inherently more patriarchal or sexist than the West because of its
132

culture or religion through arguing that we need to understand how Western imperialism, global
capitalism, militarism, sexism, and racism have created conditions of inequality for women around the
world.
In conclusion, third wave feminism is a vibrant mix of differing activist and theoretical traditions. Third
wave feminism’s insistence on grappling with multiple points-of-view, as well as its persistent refusal to
be pinned down as representing just one group of people or one perspective, may be its greatest strong
point. Similar to how queer activists and theorists have insisted that “queer” is and should be openended and never set to mean one thing, third wave feminism’s complexity, nuance, and adaptability
become assets in a world marked by rapidly shifting political situations. The third wave’s insistence on
coalitional politics as an alternative to identity-based politics is a crucial project in a world that is
marked by fluid, multiple, overlapping inequalities.

In conclusion, this unit has developed a relational analysis of feminist social movements, from the first
wave to the third wave, while understanding the limitations of categorizing resistance efforts within an
oversimplified framework of three distinct “waves.” With such a relational lens, we are better situated
to understand how the tactics and activities of one social movement can influence others. This lens also
facilitates an understanding of how racialized, gendered, and classed exclusions and privileges lead to
the splintering of social movements and social movement organizations. This type of intersectional
analysis is at the heart not only of feminist activism but of feminist scholarship. The vibrancy and
longevity of feminist movements might even be attributed to this intersectional reflexivity—or, the
critique of race, class, and gender dynamics in feminist movements. The emphasis on coalitional politics
and making connections between several movements is another crucial contribution of feminist activism
and scholarship. In the 21st century, feminist movements confront an array of structures of power:
global capitalism, the prison system, war, racism, ableism, heterosexism, and transphobia, among
others. What kind of world do we wish to create and live in? What alliances and coalitions will be
necessary to challenge these structures of power? How do feminists, queers, people of color, trans
people, disabled people, and working-class people go about challenging these structures of power?
These are among some of the questions that feminist activists are grappling with now, and their actions
point toward a deepening commitment to an intersectional politics of social justice and praxis.
